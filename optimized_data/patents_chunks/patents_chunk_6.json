When a combustion temperature is reached and maintained with a steady supply of feedstock, the emissions to air are more uniform.  Consequently, the emissions per tonne of feedstock are lower.  Abatement equipment can be designed and run to lower emissions, with a consequent lower energy use and chemical consumption.  Less supplementary fuel is required for continuous incineration than for batch incineration, since the feedstock continues to act as a fuel to maintain the combustion temperature.  For batch incineration, as the feedstock is consumed additional fuel is required to complete the combustion process.\n\nContinuous incineration may provide a faster disposal route for animal by-products and may reduce odour problems associated with the storage and handling of putrescent materials.  Incineration before malodorous substances are formed may be achievable, e.g. at incinerators located on the same site as slaughterhouses.\n\nA method of treating malodorous air, i.e. the incinerator, is always available, except when the incinerator is stopped for, e.g. maintenance.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone reported, compared with batch processes.\n\nOperational data\nMaintenance problems associated with damage to the equipment, e.g. the refractory lining of the incineration chamber, caused by frequent heating and cooling during batch incineration are avoided.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable when sizing new incinerators to process anticipated feedstock throughputs.

Steam collected from cookers, driers and evaporators is first passed through a cyclone, to separate out the solid material.  It then passes through a heat-exchanger, in which the steam is cooled.  The moist air is then dewatered.  The water is discharged to a WWTP and the air containing the malodorous substances, including air from the premises, is finally burned.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReportedly highly efficient and if properly operated, as efficient at eliminating odours, including intense odours, as other burning methods.\n\nCross-media effects\nFuel consumption is raised slightly, due to reduced boiler efficiency.  It may be necessary to keep the boiler running during rendering, even when there is no demand for steam, otherwise strong odours may escape, e.g. via a biofilter, which may be only capable of treating low intensity odours.  Keeping the boiler running incurs an additional fuel use.\n\nOperational data\nIf the installation does not have a boiler capable of running continuously to burn the malodorous gases in places where there is a demand for abatement, an alternative treatment system may be required.

A 1:1 mix of air:vapour gives an acceptable energy source with suitable heat transfer properties.\n\nFigure   4 .45 and Figure   4 .46 are schematic representations of two different evaporator types.  The evaporator shown in Figure   4 .45 is an older self-circulating evaporator, where the stickwater/evaporated stickwater circulates up through the heat-exchanger as a result of heating and vapour formation.  This circulation is not shown in the figure.  It shows the main steam and liquid flows.  The seawater flow through the barometric condenser is typically in the order of 200 m3/h, while the evaporation rate is about 5 to 20 m3/h.  The self-circulating evaporator is heated with steam from the factory boiler.  This is a very common evaporator type in the fish-meal industry.  This type of evaporator typically contains very large quantities of liquid and uses high temperatures in its first stage, where boiling temperatures of 120 - 130 degC are normal.  The large quantities of liquid lead to long average retention times and this, together with the high boiling temperatures, causes the stickwater/evaporated stickwater to be exposed to a severe heat load.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.45: Schematic representation of a 4-stage self-circulating evaporator\n[155, Nordic Council of Ministers, 1997]\n\n\n\nFigure 4.46: Schematic representation of a falling film surplus heat evaporator\n[155, Nordic Council of Ministers, 1997]\n\n\nThe evaporator shown in Figure   4 .46 is a falling film evaporator.  It shows the main steam and liquid flows.  The seawater flow through the barometric condenser is typically around 250 m3/h, while the evaporation rate is about 10 to 30 m3/h.  The stickwater/evaporated stickwater is recirculated and then pumped to the top of the heat-exchanger. Here, the liquid is dispersed into a large number of tubes where it runs as a film down the inner walls of the tubes to the bottom of the heat-exchanger.  Part of the liquid evaporates.  At the bottom of the evaporator, the liquid and vapour mixture is separated.  This evaporator type is typically heated with surplus steam from the driers but it can also be heated with steam from the boiler.  The evaporator typically contains very small quantities of liquid and this results in short average retention times.  Normally, relatively low temperatures, typically 55 - 60 degC in stage 1 and 40 - 50 degC in the last stage, are used when the evaporator is supplied with surplus vapour from the normal atmospheric pressure driers.  The product is submitted to a much lower temperature in this type of evaporator than in the self-circulating evaporator, so it has a better quality.\nIn the falling film evaporator, a correlation has been reported between the performance of the evaporator and the amount of carry-over in the impure condensate.  It is, therefore, possible to reduce carry-over by controlling the output of the evaporator.  The carry-over reported at moderate output from a falling film evaporator is reported to be slightly lower than the best results from a self-circulating evaporator.  No severe boiling-over was observed from the falling film evaporator.\n\nA self-circulating evaporator, in relation to a falling film evaporator, contains very large quantities of stickwater and evaporated stickwater which remain in the evaporator during temporary stoppages.  As stickwater and evaporated stickwater are very unstable, even very short stoppages can result in changes in the product great enough to have a negative effect on the discharge from the evaporating process on restarting the evaporator.\n\nThe large volume of the self-circulating evaporator requires very large amounts of water and NaOH for cleaning, which subsequently leads to large amounts of waste water.\n\nIt is claimed that use of falling film evaporators in the evaporating process of the fish-meal industry improves the product, as well as reducing the environmental impact.  The quality of evaporated stickwater from a falling film evaporator is reported to be considerably higher than that of evaporated stickwater from a self-circulating evaporator, due to the much lower temperatures to which the product is submitted in the falling film evaporator.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced energy consumption, due to using the vapour from the drier and by operating at lower temperatures.  Less water contamination by product loss and cleaning substances than when a self-circulating evaporator is used.\n\nCross-media effects\nSeawater is discharged at approximately 10 - 15 degC.\n\nOperational data\nThe secondary impure condensate received little contamination due to boiling-over from the self-circulating evaporator, until unidentified technical problems occurred in the evaporator.  In spite of this, the results of a statistical analysis suggest that the phosphorus content had a significant influence on the degree of pollution in the condensate.  A similar effect was not seen for the secondary impure condensate of the falling film evaporator, even though it often contained as much phosphorus as the samples from the self-circulating evaporator.\n\nThe quality of the evaporated stickwater from a falling film evaporator is considerably higher than that of evaporated stickwater from a self-circulating evaporator, because of the much lower temperatures to which the product is submitted in the latter.  The fish-meal extracted from the press cake, grax and evaporated stickwater, is also consequently of a higher quality.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in all fish-meal and fish-oil factories.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduced energy consumption and improved product quality.\n\nExample plants\nA fish-meal and fish-oil factory in Denmark.\n\nReference literature\n[155, Nordic Council of Ministers, 1997, 213, Nielsen E.W., 2001]\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3272415_abstract", "x": 0.61055315, "y": 0.2619873, "title": "METHOD OF BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF EXHAUST AIR, BIOFILM, PACKING MATERIAL OF THE BIOFILTER AND BIOFILTER MEDIUM TO IMPLEMENT THIS METHOD", "year": 2018, "text": "The invention concerns a method of biological treatment of exhaust air in an environment whose temperature exceeds 35 \u00b0C to remove volatile organic acids and/or their derivatives, a biofilm, packing material of the biofilter and biofilter medium to implement this method.

The system allows equalisation, COD removal, nutrient removal and clarification to be achieved using a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR).  The cycle comprises a timed sequence of operations and is divided into the following main stages: filling, reaction, settling, discharging and idle.\n\nBefore the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment, the waste water needs to be screened using a 0.5 - 1 mm mesh and then degreased.  If there is only one reactor, it is then collected in an equalisation tank prior to filling.\n\nFilling stage\nThe Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is filled with a quantity of waste water.  The filling can be static, aerated, anoxic and/or anaerobic and adjusted to the particular waste water by simply modifying parameters in the control unit.  This adaptability reportedly improves nutrient removal and prevents bulking problems.  The filling velocity can also be controlled and this affects the effectiveness of the final settling stage.\n\nReaction stage\nThe reactor is mixed and aerated in sequence to optimise the final removal of COD and nitrogen.  These can be controlled with dissolved oxygen or oxidation-reduction potential monitoring to ensure the desired efficiency with the minimum consumption.\n\nSettling stage\nThe biomass is separated from the treated water by sedimentation in the reactor.  The clarification is very effective since there is no countercurrent flow of the treated water.  The length of the sedimentation period can be modified during operation to improve the clarification.\n\nDischarging stage\nThe treated clarified liquid is discharged by a floating device at an appropriate height to ensure that neither settled solids nor floating debris are discharged.  Finally, the settled biomass is pumped away from the bottom of the reactor, to prevent a build-up of excess sludge.\n\nIdle stage\nWhen there is no waste water to be treated, the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is switched to an idle phase.  During this stage, it is not necessary to run the aeration systems at the same rate as during a normal cycle.\n\nAnother technique has been reported which is similar and which uses separate reactor vessels for aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic treatments.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental benefits\nThe COD reduction efficiency is reported to be as high as 95 %, thereby resulting in a low oxygen depletion potential in receiving waters.  Compared to other waste water treatment processes, the energy consumption is reported to be low, as there is no need for recirculation between tanks, since all the operations are carried out in the same tank.  There is no requirement to use chemicals and consequently there is no chemically contaminated sludge.  The sludge can be used, e.g. in composting.\n\nCross-media effects\nMost of the carbonaceous contamination ends up as CO2 emissions, which eventually contribute to global warming.  The nitrates output is higher than the input, because all of the TKN nitrifies into nitrates.  This is compensated for by the TKN output being very much lower than the input.\n\nOperational data\nCOD emission values of 22 mg/l have been reported from an Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) plant for a chicken slaughterhouse without total blood recovery.  An achieved sludge waste value of 0.05 kg SS/kg COD has been reported. \n\nAs slaughterhouse waste water contains nitrogen and phosphorus there is an associated risk of the eutrophication of receiving waters.  Emission levels as low as 0.2 mg/l of ammonium and < 1 mg/l of nitrates have been measured after Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) waste water treatment in chicken slaughterhouses, although it is reported that in practice the average levels in a plant with optimal operation is around 1 - 2 mg/l of ammonium and 5 - 15 mg/l of nitrates.\n\nSBRs can alternate anoxic periods with aerobic periods, thereby removing nitrogen from the waste water.  The length of the anoxic periods can be adjusted to create anaerobic conditions which facilitate up to about 40 % phosphorus removal.\n\nIt is reported that odour is not a problem if the biological reactor and the equalisation tank are well aerated.\n\nIt is reported that there is a low risk of accidents, since the plant works automatically and requires very little control by personnel.\n\nIt is reported that a de-foaming agent is the only chemical required and only during the first week of starting-up, due to blood in the waste water.\n\nTable   4 .102, Table   4 .103, Table   4 .104 and Table   4 .105 show data for a pilot plant and for three existing Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) WWTPs in poultry slaughterhouses.\n\nTable 4.102: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a poultry slaughterhouse pilot plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.103: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 40 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nTable 4.104: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 100 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nTable 4.105: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 470 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nThe Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is automated and controlled using a PLC.  The main controls are for the cleaning of the screens and the degreasing units rather than for the operation of the technique.  The operation of the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is monitored by the periodic measurement of V30 values, i.e. by measuring the volume of a 1 litre sludge from the reactor after 30 minutes sedimentation time.\n\nThe cycle can be adjusted easily at the touch panel of the PLC and as required by the properties of the inlet waste water, e.g. if the COD:N changes or if there is a problem due to the appearance of filamentous bacteria, which create bulking.\n\nThe sludge is normally dried in a decanter, to achieve a 95 % reduction in volume.\n\nSBRs are reported to provide low maintenance secondary treatment, as they use less electromechanical equipment than other biological treatments.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in all slaughterhouses.\n\nThe technique is reported to have the advantages of not requiring much space and not requiring a clarification system (sedimentation or flotation units) or separate anoxic treatment for denitrification or phosphorus removal.  It operates at a high solids concentration (MLVSS = 4000 - 5000 mg/l), so low volumes are required.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs\nSequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is reported to be the cheapest secondary treatment, because the treatment can be carried out in one vessel.\n\nThe reported selling prices of some slaughterhouse Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment plants are shown in Table   4 .106.\n\nTable 4.106: Reported selling prices of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment plants in 6 slaughterhouses\n\n\nOperational costs\nThe range of electrical costs reported is EUR 0.12 - 0.25/m3, for a EUR 0.06/kWh cost for electricity.  There are no chemical reagent costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driving force for the use of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) in slaughterhouses is its capacity for removing nitrogen contents with a high efficiency and low investment and running costs.  The technique is flexible and conditions such as the length and frequency of anoxic periods, filling velocity, settling time and anaerobic periods can be easily altered using a PLC.

The length of the anoxic periods can be adjusted to create anaerobic conditions which facilitate up to about 40 % phosphorus removal.\n\nIt is reported that odour is not a problem if the biological reactor and the equalisation tank are well aerated.\n\nIt is reported that there is a low risk of accidents, since the plant works automatically and requires very little control by personnel.\n\nIt is reported that a de-foaming agent is the only chemical required and only during the first week of starting-up, due to blood in the waste water.\n\nTable   4 .102, Table   4 .103, Table   4 .104 and Table   4 .105 show data for a pilot plant and for three existing Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) WWTPs in poultry slaughterhouses.\n\nTable 4.102: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a poultry slaughterhouse pilot plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.103: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 40 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nTable 4.104: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 100 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nTable 4.105: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 470 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nThe Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is automated and controlled using a PLC.  The main controls are for the cleaning of the screens and the degreasing units rather than for the operation of the technique.  The operation of the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is monitored by the periodic measurement of V30 values, i.e. by measuring the volume of a 1 litre sludge from the reactor after 30 minutes sedimentation time.\n\nThe cycle can be adjusted easily at the touch panel of the PLC and as required by the properties of the inlet waste water, e.g. if the COD:N changes or if there is a problem due to the appearance of filamentous bacteria, which create bulking.\n\nThe sludge is normally dried in a decanter, to achieve a 95 % reduction in volume.\n\nSBRs are reported to provide low maintenance secondary treatment, as they use less electromechanical equipment than other biological treatments.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in all slaughterhouses.\n\nThe technique is reported to have the advantages of not requiring much space and not requiring a clarification system (sedimentation or flotation units) or separate anoxic treatment for denitrification or phosphorus removal.  It operates at a high solids concentration (MLVSS = 4000 - 5000 mg/l), so low volumes are required.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs\nSequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is reported to be the cheapest secondary treatment, because the treatment can be carried out in one vessel.\n\nThe reported selling prices of some slaughterhouse Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment plants are shown in Table   4 .106.\n\nTable 4.106: Reported selling prices of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment plants in 6 slaughterhouses\n\n\nOperational costs\nThe range of electrical costs reported is EUR 0.12 - 0.25/m3, for a EUR 0.06/kWh cost for electricity.  There are no chemical reagent costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driving force for the use of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) in slaughterhouses is its capacity for removing nitrogen contents with a high efficiency and low investment and running costs.  The technique is flexible and conditions such as the length and frequency of anoxic periods, filling velocity, settling time and anaerobic periods can be easily altered using a PLC.  The technique does not require a lot of space.\n\nExample plants\nAt least 3 poultry slaughterhouses in Spain, one ostrich slaughterhouse in Cyprus and several pig, poultry and cattle slaughterhouses in the Netherlands.  There are plans for the technique to be installed in a pig slaughterhouse and a poultry slaughterhouse in Cyprus.\n\nReference literature\n[302, Jimenez Rodriguez J J., 2002, 306, Hydrotech Water and Environmental Engineering Ltd, 2001, 333, Netherlands Technical Working Group (TWG), 2003]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3656459_abstract", "x": 0.6405184, "y": 0.23767453, "title": "AQUEOUS COMPOSITION FOR THE SEPARATION OF CO2 AND/OR ACID GASES", "year": 2020, "text": "The invention relates to an absorbent composition for capturing CO2 or any other acid gas from a gas stream by means of regenerative chemical absorption based on an optimised adjustment of the cyclical working capacity of the absorbent.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.3.9\" title=\"Wet scrubbing - general\">\n\n<content>\nWet scrubbing - general\n\nDescription\nThe concentration of malodorous substances in waste gases can be reduced by means of a waste gas scrubbing process using a scrubbing fluid (absorption agent).  The absorption of a substance by the scrubbing fluid is a balance reaction which depends on the solubility and vapour pressure of the substance under the prevailing temperature and pressure conditions; the contact area; the residence time and the ratio of the gas flowrate to the liquid flowrate.  The process can be optimised by atomising the scrubbing fluid and by coating absorbers on support material to maximise the surface area exposed.\n\nWater is frequently used as a preliminary scrubbing fluid to remove dust and droplets of fat, which could otherwise interfere with the activity of the absorbent, as well as to remove some of the nitrogenous compounds.  The use of water alone, even in several stages, is not sufficient to reduce odour emissions to acceptable levels.  It is, therefore, usually followed by exposure to acid or alkali oxidising streams.\n\nGas absorbers are essentially gas-liquid contacting devices where vapours and gases are absorbed from a contaminated exhaust stream into chemical solutions.  This liquid phase is generally recirculated, with a small quantity being continually bled off and an equal amount of fresh reagent being added.  Malodorous pollutants are absorbed into appropriate chemical solutions-oxidants. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nOdour reduction.\n\n\n\nCross-media effects\nWaste water is generated.  Generally in installations there is inadequate separating capacity and a lack of suitable means of feedback control for the metering of chemicals.  In Germany, there have consequently been no new investments in chemical scrubbers for the past several years, not even for use in old plants.\n\nThe use of oxidants can lead to the formation of malodorous compounds and poor liquid effluent management and can create a secondary odour source.\n\nApplicability\nThe cost effectiveness of absorbers is reduced, if the exhaust gas to be treated has a high moisture content, due to their preferential absorption of water vapour.\n\nReference literature\n[49, VDI, 1996, 241, UK, 2002]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3260484_abstract", "x": 0.5473152, "y": 0.12103363, "title": "METHOD OF PRELIMINARY HYDROLYSIS OF CREATINE-CONTAINING RAW MATERIALS, IN PARTICULAR BRISTLES", "year": 2017, "text": "The invention relates to the method of preliminary hydrolysis of creatine-containing raw materials, in particular bristles as a by-product of animal origin.The method consists in the exposure of the raw material to live steam at the minimum pressure of 5 bar and preferably at the temperature of 150 \u00b0C, the process being aided by calcium hydroxide in the minimum amount of 3 % for min. 20 minutes.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.13\" title=\"Alkaline hydrolysis of animal carcases and parts of animal carcases at elevated temperature\">\n<references_to>4.1</references_to>\n\n<content>\nAlkaline hydrolysis of animal carcases and parts of animal carcases at elevated temperature\n\nSee also Sections 4.1 and 4.3.1.\n\nDescription\nThe heated alkaline hydrolysis process effectively digests and disposes of animal carcases and reportedly inactivates BSE agents.  The animal and microbial tissues are converted into a reportedly sterile, neutral aqueous solution, which, after cooling, is discharged to an anaerobic digestion process for further treatment.  The anaerobic digestion produces CH4 gas which can be used to generate electricity or steam.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDestruction of microbial risk during alkaline hydrolysis.  Energy production from anaerobic digestion.\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumption of water, although it does not need to be potable and consumption of alkali, usually 50 % solutions of NaOH or KOH.  A steam raising capacity is needed to heat water, at a rate of 1 kg steam/kg feedstock.  Electricity is required at a rate of 17 kW for every 4.5 tonnes of feedstock.\n\nOperational data\nAlkaline hydrolysis at elevated temperature is undertaken in insulated, steam-jacketed, stainless steel tissue digesters with lids which can either be manually or hydraulically clamped.  The vessel contains a basket for the retention of bone remnants.  The tissue digesters are manufactured in a range from 36 kg - 4.56 t.  Animal carcases are generally treated without any prior size reduction, without any reported reduction in effectivity of the technique.\nRaw material handling arrangements reportedly depend on the scale of operation and range from manual handling to systems of rails, conveyors and chutes.\n\nFor larger scale operations a series of digesters can be installed.  The process operates at 150 oC, for 3 hours and > 400 kPa pressure.  It is automated during the process cycle.\n\nThe process converts proteins, nucleic acids and lipids of all cells and tissues, as well as infectious micro-organisms, to a sterile aqueous solution of small peptides, amino acids, sugars and soaps.  The alkali is consumed in the process, by generating the salts of the hydrolysis products.  Ash comprising the mineral constituents of the bones and teeth of vertebrates, is produced and represents approximately 3 % of the weight of original carcase/tissue.  This is easily crushed by hand and can reportedly be recovered as calcium phosphate powder.\n\nA heat-exchange for heating water can be built into the system design.\n\nThe digestion residue is discharged directly to the balance tank of the anaerobic digestion system.  It has been suggested that the residues from anaerobic digestion could be used as follows: crushed bone from non-BSE risk animals as fertiliser, liquid residue from non-BSE risk animals as fertiliser.  The liquid residue from BSE risk animals could possibly be evaporated to minimise the solid residue and then be disposed of to landfill or by incineration, according to relevant legislation.\n\nFor an example digester of 4.5 t capacity, the following consumption and emission levels are reported:\n\nTo the 4.5 t of animal material, between 50 - 100 % equivalent weight of water, i.e. 2.25 - 4.5 t is added.  The amount depends on the animal material.  The addition of alkali to the tissue digester is 14 %, for NaOH and 21 % for KOH, of the weight of the animal carcase/tissue material to be processed.  4.5 kg of raw material requires 4.5 kg of steam.  The electricity requirement is 11.1 kW/t of raw material.\n\nApplicability\nAt the time of writing, this technique is not permitted in the EU, due to the fact that in ABP Regulation 1774/2002/EC, it is neither listed, nor has it been approved in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 33(2) therein, after consultation of the appropriate scientific committee.\n\nThe process is being marketed in the red and white meat and rendering industries, in preparation for potentially receiving approval under the procedures prescribed in ABP Regulation 1774/2002/EC, both in terms of BSE type risk and non-infected by-product treatment and disposal, as an alternative to, e.g. landfill.\n\nIt can reportedly be applied to a range of plant sizes, from small to very large, with the installation of multiple units being appropriate for large scale operations, for which there is a reported economy of scale.  The technique may be applied as an integrated system for on-site treatment and disposal, thereby saving on transport costs and environmental damage.\n\nEconomics\nA 4.5 t capacity alkaline hydrolysis tissue digester is reported to be capable of processing 18 t of animal carcase waste material per 24 hour period.  If it operates 7 days per week, 52 weeks per year, the annual throughput will, therefore, be 6570 t.\n\nThe capital investment cost for a 4.5 t capacity tissue digester is calculated at EUR 20.9/t of material processed, if the capital cost is assumed to be spread over 10 years, ignoring interest charges.\n\nThe operating cost for the tissue digester is calculated at EUR 41/t of material processed.\nThe capital and operating costs of combined alkaline hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion systems are to some extent offset by the income from energy generation.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe need to destroy BSE agents, without the use of incineration.  The pretreatment of waste prior to landfill, to satisfy the requirements of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste.\n\nExample plants\nAlkaline hydrolysis is reportedly in full scale use in the US, for disposing of TSE infection risk sheep, elk and deer.  Pharmaceutical research companies and medical/veterinary university research units have also installed tissue digesters for the disposal of animal and human material.  They are in use in Canada for the disposal of TSE wastes.  No plants are in operation in the EU, due to the current lack of approval of the technique as required by ABP Regulation 1774/2002/EC.  Such approval is currently being sought.\n\nThe anaerobic digestion plants incorporated with this technique are currently applied in 100 full scale operational installations in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe combined technologies have not yet been installed on an integrated site.\n\nReference literature\n[294, Waste Reduction Europe Ltd, 2002]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3101351_abstract", "x": 0.8087456, "y": 0.2389055, "title": "TEMPERATURE REGULATION SYSTEM", "year": 2016, "text": "A temperature regulation system includes a water unit (2) that produces hot water or cold water and that includes a controller (14), headers (21, 22) that are connected to the water unit (2) through water pipes (52, 53) which guide the hot water or the cold water produced by the water unit (2) to specified supply destinations (27, 28) and which guide return water produced in the specified supply destinations (27, 28) to the water unit (2), and a plurality of thermal valves (23 through 26) connected to the header (21).

Steam pressure and water pressure may vary throughout the day, so the temperature may also vary.  To ensure that minimum temperature requirements, not necessarily required by law, for wash or rinse water are met, an operator may open steam valves enough so that the water always remains above a certain temperature.  This leads to unnecessarily high temperatures when the steam pressure is high or the water pressure is low.  If thermostatically controlled steam and water blending valves are used, they can automatically control the water temperature and remove the responsibility from the operator to judge the correct setting.\n\nAn energy savings calculation for lowering the water temperature for cleaning at one station by installing an automatic controlled steam and water blending valve is shown below.\n\nThis calculation assumes a starting water temperature of 100 oC and a flowrate of 83.3 l/min.  The target cleaning water temperature is 60 oC.  Gas is used in a steam boiler at a cost of USD 0.495/therm (i.e. USD 4.67/GJ).

The calculated annual saving is USD 2698 (Costs in 2000).\nAnother example shows the energy and cost savings when using water with an incoming water temperature of 16 oC and for lowering the temperature the water is heated to from 71 oC, to various lower temperatures.  The example assumes a water use of 831 l/min, 6 h/d for 250 d/yr.

The process is controlled by monitoring the concentrations of ammonia and nitrogen oxides.  Consequently, a number of aeration devices are automatically switched on or off.  For example, a single tank may be divided into aerobic and anoxic zones.  During the alternating operational method, individual, sequentially arranged tanks are operated alternately on an aerobic or anoxic basis which coincides with the simultaneous transfer of effluent between tanks.  During the intermittent operational method, the tanks are operated in parallel.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRemoval of nitrogen, BOD and COD compounds from high loaded waste water steams, which have not been excluded by other means.\n\nCross-media effects\nOdour problems may be caused.  Energy is used, e.g. during aeration.\n\nOperational data\nThe technique is characterised by the removal of BOD without aeration, combined with the denitrification typically required for the waste water from slaughterhouses and animal by-products installations.  This offers the advantage of minimising energy consumption.  It has been reported that aeration can account for 60 % of energy consumption at WWTPs.\n\nThe aeration is achieved by diffusing the air through a very large number of fine holes, to ensure that there is enough oxygen in the waste water to undertake the nitrification required for the high nitrogen loads which are typical for the waste water from this industry.\n\nIn addition, the technique is characterised by high sludge ages, which also assist the denitrification process.\n\nAt one rendering plant where the treatment is applied, it is reported that the effluent is first subjected to fat separation, solids removal using cylindrical sieves, flotation, mixing and equalisation.\n\nThe treatment is then carried out in large-volume, foil-sealed earth basins.  Aeration is carried out intermittently.  Full nitrogen elimination, through simultaneous nitrification/denitrification, is reportedly achieved.  The main part of the BOD and COD load can be removed without aeration. The introduction of air and the circulation of the biomass are achieved using 8 aerator chains.  The aerator chains consist of 7 floating aerators, each connected to the others by means of air supply hoses.  The air is introduced in the form of small bubbles, over the basin floor.  The required quantity of air is made available through sliding vane rotary compressors.  A compressor constantly runs on base load in order to ensure a specific minimum level of circulation of the activated sludge.  The connection of further compressors is regulated by a timing programme and an automatic oxidation/reduction control.

Mixtures of (a) argon, nitrogen or other inert gases, or any mixture of these gases, in atmospheric air with a maximum 2 % oxygen by volume or (b) any mixture of argon, nitrogen, or other inert gases with atmospheric air and CO2 provided that the CO2 concentration does not exceed 30 % by volume and the oxygen concentration does not exceed 2 % by volume, can be used.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced dust emissions during unloading, hanging and bleeding.  It has also been reported that improved quality and yield have led to a reduced by-product destined for disposal as waste.  The increase in yield in turn leads to a tendency to store more of the slaughterhouse output, in conditions which will not cause spillage or odour problems.\n\nReduced energy consumption due to reduced refrigeration time and space requirements, since it is no longer necessary to mature the carcases.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe reduced energy consumption, due to reduced refrigeration requirements may be offset by installations using a nitrogen separation plant for processing atmospheric air.\n\nOperational data\nA reduction in dust levels, from 11.1 - 29.6 mg/m3 to 9.0 mg/m3, has been reported.\n\nA proprietary system has 12 draws per module, each with a capacity of around 24 broiler chickens per draw, giving a total of 288 birds per module.  A typical poultry processing line operates at 8000 birds per hour, thereby killing around 70000 birds per line, per day.\n\nThe system is reported to have the following advantages.  It does not impede blood loss, therefore, residual blood in the carcase meat is low.  In comparison with electrical stunning, it reduces the number of birds with broken bones and the number of broken bones per bird; this is important as broken wish and collarbones frequently cause haemorrhaging in breast fillets and tender loins.  It greatly reduces the incidence of haemorrhaging, not associated with broken bones, in the breast and leg muscles and this improves the yield and the value of products.\n\nResearch during 2001 indicated that the adoption of a gas mixture consisting of 80 % by volume nitrogen and 20 % by volume argon, is considered to be better than the carbon dioxide-argon mixture from bird welfare and meat quality points of views.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in poultry slaughterhouses.\n\nEconomics\nAt a cost of GBP 1200 per module (1995), the maximum investment on modules alone works out to be around GBP 288000.  To this module cost, around GBP 200000 must be added for the standard plant handling equipment plus approximately a further GBP 200000 for the stunning equipment.  Total equipment costs for a complete installation on one processing line are therefore estimated to be about GBP 700000.\n\nSlaughterhouses using the system from 1995 - 1999, used a mixture of 30 % CO2 and 60 % argon in air (leaving 8 % nitrogen and 2 % oxygen from residual air).  Carbon dioxide and argon were stored in separate silos at the processing plant and mixed prior to supply into the stunning unit.  Changing the gas silos to store nitrogen and argon led to additional costs.\n\nThe stunning unit is designed and built to accommodate gases which are heavier than air, and to minimise the gas loss.  Maintaining 25 - 30 % CO2 and 1.5 - 2.0 % residual oxygen in argon in the unit, at a throughput rate of 7000 birds per hour, the gas consumption is estimated to be 17 litres of mixed gas per bird.  In 1995, based on UK prices, the cost of stunning with this mixture was estimated to be between GPB 0.8 - 1.0 per 100 birds.  The implementation of a mixture of 80 % nitrogen and 20 % argon in 2001, is estimated to have reduced the cost to between GBP 0.3 - 0.5 per 100 birds.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driving force is reported to be animal welfare.\n\nSome of the major welfare concerns associated with the water-bath electrical stunning systems, which reportedly cause stress, trauma and pain, are removed.

The matte obtained is converted into low-iron nickel matte in a converter. In both processing steps, oxygen enrichment is used to reach an autogenous processing point. The use of oxygen enrichment allows the melting of returns, scrap and other secondary materials, especially in the converting step. Also, as the total gas flow is lowered, the electricity consumption of the fans (process gas, ventilation, etc.) is lowered.\n\nIn direct nickel flash smelting (Direct Outotec Nickel (DON)) technology, high-grade nickel matte with a low iron content is produced in the flash smelting furnace directly without subsequent converting. The dried feed mixture, oxygen-enriched process air and distribution air are mixed in the concentrate burner. The concentrate ignites and burns in the turbulent gas-solid suspension in the reaction shaft. The oxidation of concentrate feed is taken further than in the conventional process. This burning process generates a large amount of energy, causing the charge to melt. Flash smelting is an energy-efficient process since it makes use of the reaction heat of the concentrate, and therefore external fuel is only needed from time to time. The usage of oxygen enrichment in a flash smelting furnace has a significant savings effect on energy consumption and results in better pollution control. Matte produced using this process has a low iron and high nickel content. The Direct Outotec Nickel (DON) process has made a separate conversion step unnecessary, which has an important positive effect in terms of the environment and the energy consumption.\n\nHeat recovery boiler\nThe hot, SO2-rich gas produced in the smelting furnace or converting vessel is conducted to the heat recovery boiler. In the waste heat boiler, gas is cooled by generating steam from which energy is recovered. The steam is used for example in the drying of concentrates and for various process heating needs, such as in autoclaves. Electricity and heat for district heating may be generated from the extra steam in the power plant.\n\nIn indirect steam coil drying, the saturated steam produced in the heat recovery boiler connected to the smelting furnace is utilised.\n\nUse of flue-gas energy\nIn direct drying, the hot gas is produced by the combustion of fuel in a separate chamber. To recover the energy content of the hot gas from other process steps, anode furnace exhaust gases can be partly recycled into the dryer.\n\nHeat exchangers to recover the heat from the warm gas or solution flows\nWith regards to slag cleaning, the metals in the smelting/converting slag are removed in an electric furnace as an iron-containing nickel matte. Electric furnace gases are first post-combusted and then cooled. Heat from gas cooling is removed by a heat exchanger and used for heating and drying additives or coke for the electric furnace.\n\nProduction of sulphuric acid from SO2-containing gas produces extra energy, which is removed and utilised. Oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide is an exothermic reaction. Part of the energy produced by this oxidation is transferred using a heat exchanger to intermediate water for heating other process units or is sent to a second heat exchanger for district heating.\n\nCooling of acid is carried out using a heat exchanger where energy is removed to intermediate water. Energy from the intermediate water moves via the second heat exchanger into a district heating line or to heat other process units.\n\nThe chlorine leach process is highly exothermic, and steam in the off-gas from the leach tanks is condensed and heat is recovered into a separate glycol circuit, which is distributed for heating offices and plant buildings.\n\nBefore recycling anolyte in the nickel tank house, the solution has to be cooled. A heat exchanger is installed to cool down the anolyte before reuse, and the heated water is distributed to other processes that consume hot water or used for cleaning purposes in other areas of the plant.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of energy consumption.\nReduction of emissions to air (in most cases the recovered energy replaces fossil fuel).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPlant A: The direct electricity consumption of the nickel smelter is 1400-1800 kWh/t of metal produced, excluding for example oxygen and pressurised air (over-the-fence consumables). The fuel oil consumption in the smelter is 300-400 kg/t of metal produced including concentrate drying, flash furnace fuel, and fuel for heating up the Flash Smelting Furnace (FSF) and EF. The coke consumption in the nickel smelter is 200-250 kg/t of metal produced, including coke reductant in the slag cleaning electric furnace.\n\nPlant C: The refinery electricity consumption is 3000-4000 kWh/t of nickel produced. Heat consumption is 7 000-9 000 kWh/t of nickel produced. Plant A's copper and nickel smelters and Plant C's refinery are operating on the same site. The plants' companies have common heat recovery systems. About 50-70 % of the heat used at the site is recovered from the different process steps.\n\nPlant E: The refinery electricity consumption is about 5 MWh/t of nickel, copper and cobalt produced. This plant delivers 40 000-45 000 MWh/yr for district heating from the sulphuric acid plant. The exothermic chlorine leach process contributes 12 MW for heating of buildings on site.

This slag cleaning process is based on slow-cooling of the molten slag, crushing and wet grinding of the cooled slag and recovery of copper by flotation to produce a slag concentrate. A slag concentrator is used where sufficient space is available and where the final slag can be adequately treated or disposed of. In order to achieve a good metal recovery, the material for slag flotation needs to be milled to a fine grain size. This final slag can be used for different industrial applications, although its potential for use may be limited due to the fine particle size and so some slag may need to be disposed of. The slag concentrate is fed into the flash smelting furnace together with the primary concentrate.\n\nThe energy consumption of a slag concentrator is lower than for the electric slag cleaning furnace process. No additional energy is required for the gas-cleaning equipment. Higher copper recovery can be achieved than with slag furnace treatment.\n\nThe slag concentration plant operates flexibly, adapting to variations in the feed. Decoupling of the slag treatment from the main smelter process is realised.\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are the following:\n\nWater sprays. Applied to suppress dust emission during handling, storage and crushing.\nDrainage system. Applied to recover water from all the operations performed under water spraying, to avoid soil and underground water contamination.\nCollection and reuse in the process of the water from the cooling area and the flotation process as well as from the hydro transport of the final slag.\nSpecial design for the slag storage basin to protect the soil and prevent underground water contamination, and retention of a water layer to prevent diffuse dust emissions. The final slags are transported to the final storage using hydro transport in closed pipelines.\n\nTechnical description\nIn the slag concentration process, slag is cooled by air and water sprays in ladles or pits. Drainage systems are installed at the cooling areas and water is recirculated. Water sprinkling facilities are installed at handling and storage areas to suppress dust emissions.\n\nSingle stage crushing is performed. Water sprinkling facilities can also be installed at the inlet of crushing and transfer points after the reception bins. The grinding process is a two-stage process, where the first step is an autogenous mill and the second a ball or pebble mill. The primary mill can be in an open or closed circuit, depending on the secondary stage. In the closed circuit process, the classifier can be a screen, spiral or cyclone type. The secondary stage is in a closed circuit with cyclones.\n\nSecondary grinding overflow is followed by flotation, which typically comprises a rougher, scavenger and two cleaning stages. Scavenger concentrates and first cleaner tails are circulated back to the rougher. Flotation is a physical and chemical process done in natural pH with a xanthate collector and frother. Grinding and flotation processes are performed with water, thereby preventing emissions to air.\n\nCopper concentrate is dewatered conventionally with a thickener and vacuum filter. Filter cake, together with the smelting feed mixture, goes to drying and back to the smelting furnace.\n\nWater is recirculated by drainage pumps and reused in the process. \n\nThe final slags are transported to a pond using hydro transport in closed pipelines. The solids settle in the pond; water is decanted and returned to the flotation process. The dam wall and the bottom of the pond are protected with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lining to prevent infiltration into the soil and underground waters. In order to prevent the drying out of solids and dust emissions, a water layer is kept on the surface of the pond. Dust suppressants, such as lime milk, can also be used on dry areas.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMinimisation of emissions to air, as slag cleaning is a wet process.\nWater is reused.\nRecovery of copper, and raw material savings.\nProtection of the soil and of the groundwater.\nFinal slag can be used for different industrial applications, such as road construction and other fill applications, for clinker production or as a mineral addition to blended cements, or as a component for iron/steel production.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAt Boliden Harjavalta, the slag from the copper flash furnace and the converters is treated for copper recovery in the slag concentrator. Slag is slow-cooled in ladles by a water spray. After cooling, the ladles are emptied by a hydraulic hammer. Then the slag is crushed by a cone crusher, ground by a lump mill and pebble mill, and treated in the slag concentrator. Copper-bearing particles are separated in flotation cells using air, water, flotation oil and xanthates. The slag concentrate is then thickened, filtered and recycled back to the copper flash furnace feed mixture.\n\nThe final tailings from the slag concentrator, mostly iron silicate, are discarded from the flotation cells and pumped into a specially prepared tailings storage area. Slag cooling area water handling is a part of the water circuit of the slag concentrator. The water in the slag concentrator is recycled and bled out to water treatment.\n\nAt Boliden Ronnskar, the slag from the copper flash furnace is treated for copper recovery in a slag concentration process. The slag is cooled in ladles, crushed and transported by covered trucks to a slag concentrator, where copper is recovered by milling and flotation. The concentrate is recycled to the copper furnace feed mixture. The final tailings are pumped in a specially prepared tailings storage pond, together with flotation tailings from ore flotation. The water in the slag concentrator is recycled.\n\nAt Aurubis Pirdop, the flash furnace and converter slags are transported to the cooling area by railway wagons. Slag is cooled in crystallisation pits by consecutive air and water cooling. Equipment includes a drainage system and pump station. All water for cooling is recycled. The cooled slag is excavated and transported to a receiving hopper or open storage area. Single stage crushing is performed by a jaw crusher. Crushed slag is transported by a rubber belt conveyor to two bunkers and then fed to the grinding section for grinding and classification. Grinding is performed in two stages.\n\nPrimary grinding takes place in autogenous mills. The first autogenous mill (capacity: 45-50 tonnes/hour) operates in a closed circuit with a spiral classifier. Overflow from the classifier enters a pump sump, and power hydrocyclones. The second autogenous mill (capacity: 100-105 tonnes/hour) operates in a closed circuit with two hydrocyclones. Secondary grinding takes place in a ball mill operating in a closed loop with three hydrocyclones.\n\nThe hydrocyclone overflow goes to flotation. The flotation comprises a classic circuit: rougher, scavenger and two cleaning flotations. First, cleaner tailings, together with scavenger concentrate, are pumped to the second rougher flotation. Second, cleaner tailings are pumped to the first cleaning.\n\nThe slag concentrate slurry is pumped from the flotation cells to a thickener. The thickener underflow is filtered with a disk vacuum filter. The slag concentrate formed on the filter is returned to the flash smelting furnace. The thickener water overflow is pumped via a tank to the process water reservoir, closing the circulation water cycle of the flotation plant.\n\nAll areas have floor sumps for the collection of spillages.\n\nThe final slag is pumped to a tailings pond by two slurry pumps in series operation. Slag is settled and water is pumped to a collecting tank, from where it returns to the slag concentrator to be used as process water.\n\nThe tailing pond is contained by a dam wall. The dam wall and the bottom of the pond are protected with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lining to avoid infiltration into the soil and underground waters. The surface of the pond is kept under a layer of water to avoid fugitive emissions of dust.\n\nCross-media effects\nWater sprinkler\nIncrease in water consumption.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nEconomics\nThe slag concentrator requires:\n\nconsumption of reagents: xanthate ~ 240 g/t; frother ~ 7.5 g/t;\npower consumption for grinding: autogenous mill ~ 18.2 kWh/t; ball mill ~ 14.3 kWh/t.\n\nBuilding a final slag tailing pond (capacity of 1.6 million m3) involved an investment of up to EUR 8 million (2002, Aurubis Pirdop), including pump station, pressure steel duct, and closed circuit water system.\n\nAn upgrade and increase of capacity of the pond to 3.65 million m3, total area 220 acres, involved an investment of EUR 6.5 million (2008, Aurubis Pirdop).\nBuilding 45 new cooling and crystallisation pits involved an investment of EUR 1.350 million (2007-2009, Aurubis Pirdop)\n\nA project for expanding and increasing the capacity of the flotation plant involved an  investment of up to EUR 14 million (2010, Aurubis Pirdop), including for a second autogenous mill and additional flotation cells.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMinimisation of emissions to air and water.\n\nExample plants\nBoliden Harjavalta (FI), Boliden Ronnskar (SE), and Aurubis Pirdop (BG).\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4059884_abstract", "x": 0.54947764, "y": 0.29864913, "title": "METHOD FOR PRODUCING COPPER METAL FROM COPPER CONCENTRATES WITHOUT GENERATING WASTE", "year": 2022, "text": "The invention relates to a method for producing copper metal from copper concentrates without generating waste, which comprises: (a) oxidizing copper concentrate; (b) cleaning and cooling the gases; (c) feeding to a reduction reactor; (d) cleaning the gases; (e) discharging hot powders and calcines into water; (f) performing magnetic separation; (g) thickening and filtering the magnetic fraction; (h) floating silica and inert materials; (i) thickening and filtering the silica and inert materials; (j) thickening and filtering the final concentrate containing the copper metal and noble metals; (k) smelting the final concentrate of copper and noble metals; and (I) recirculating ground smelt slag to a roasting reactor.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.3.4.1\" title=\"Techniques to prevent and reduce emissions from copper-rich slag processing by slow-cooling, crushing, milling and flotation (slag concentrator)\">\n\n<content>\nTechniques to prevent and reduce emissions from copper-rich slag processing by slow-cooling, crushing, milling and flotation (slag concentrator)\n\nCopper-rich slags from smelting and/or converting can be treated for copper recovery in a slag concentrator.

The primary mill can be in an open or closed circuit, depending on the secondary stage. In the closed circuit process, the classifier can be a screen, spiral or cyclone type. The secondary stage is in a closed circuit with cyclones.\n\nSecondary grinding overflow is followed by flotation, which typically comprises a rougher, scavenger and two cleaning stages. Scavenger concentrates and first cleaner tails are circulated back to the rougher. Flotation is a physical and chemical process done in natural pH with a xanthate collector and frother. Grinding and flotation processes are performed with water, thereby preventing emissions to air.\n\nCopper concentrate is dewatered conventionally with a thickener and vacuum filter. Filter cake, together with the smelting feed mixture, goes to drying and back to the smelting furnace.\n\nWater is recirculated by drainage pumps and reused in the process. \n\nThe final slags are transported to a pond using hydro transport in closed pipelines. The solids settle in the pond; water is decanted and returned to the flotation process. The dam wall and the bottom of the pond are protected with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lining to prevent infiltration into the soil and underground waters. In order to prevent the drying out of solids and dust emissions, a water layer is kept on the surface of the pond. Dust suppressants, such as lime milk, can also be used on dry areas.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMinimisation of emissions to air, as slag cleaning is a wet process.\nWater is reused.\nRecovery of copper, and raw material savings.\nProtection of the soil and of the groundwater.\nFinal slag can be used for different industrial applications, such as road construction and other fill applications, for clinker production or as a mineral addition to blended cements, or as a component for iron/steel production.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAt Boliden Harjavalta, the slag from the copper flash furnace and the converters is treated for copper recovery in the slag concentrator. Slag is slow-cooled in ladles by a water spray. After cooling, the ladles are emptied by a hydraulic hammer. Then the slag is crushed by a cone crusher, ground by a lump mill and pebble mill, and treated in the slag concentrator. Copper-bearing particles are separated in flotation cells using air, water, flotation oil and xanthates. The slag concentrate is then thickened, filtered and recycled back to the copper flash furnace feed mixture.\n\nThe final tailings from the slag concentrator, mostly iron silicate, are discarded from the flotation cells and pumped into a specially prepared tailings storage area. Slag cooling area water handling is a part of the water circuit of the slag concentrator. The water in the slag concentrator is recycled and bled out to water treatment.\n\nAt Boliden Ronnskar, the slag from the copper flash furnace is treated for copper recovery in a slag concentration process. The slag is cooled in ladles, crushed and transported by covered trucks to a slag concentrator, where copper is recovered by milling and flotation. The concentrate is recycled to the copper furnace feed mixture. The final tailings are pumped in a specially prepared tailings storage pond, together with flotation tailings from ore flotation. The water in the slag concentrator is recycled.\n\nAt Aurubis Pirdop, the flash furnace and converter slags are transported to the cooling area by railway wagons. Slag is cooled in crystallisation pits by consecutive air and water cooling. Equipment includes a drainage system and pump station. All water for cooling is recycled. The cooled slag is excavated and transported to a receiving hopper or open storage area. Single stage crushing is performed by a jaw crusher. Crushed slag is transported by a rubber belt conveyor to two bunkers and then fed to the grinding section for grinding and classification. Grinding is performed in two stages.\n\nPrimary grinding takes place in autogenous mills. The first autogenous mill (capacity: 45-50 tonnes/hour) operates in a closed circuit with a spiral classifier. Overflow from the classifier enters a pump sump, and power hydrocyclones. The second autogenous mill (capacity: 100-105 tonnes/hour) operates in a closed circuit with two hydrocyclones. Secondary grinding takes place in a ball mill operating in a closed loop with three hydrocyclones.\n\nThe hydrocyclone overflow goes to flotation. The flotation comprises a classic circuit: rougher, scavenger and two cleaning flotations. First, cleaner tailings, together with scavenger concentrate, are pumped to the second rougher flotation. Second, cleaner tailings are pumped to the first cleaning.\n\nThe slag concentrate slurry is pumped from the flotation cells to a thickener. The thickener underflow is filtered with a disk vacuum filter. The slag concentrate formed on the filter is returned to the flash smelting furnace. The thickener water overflow is pumped via a tank to the process water reservoir, closing the circulation water cycle of the flotation plant.\n\nAll areas have floor sumps for the collection of spillages.\n\nThe final slag is pumped to a tailings pond by two slurry pumps in series operation. Slag is settled and water is pumped to a collecting tank, from where it returns to the slag concentrator to be used as process water.\n\nThe tailing pond is contained by a dam wall. The dam wall and the bottom of the pond are protected with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lining to avoid infiltration into the soil and underground waters. The surface of the pond is kept under a layer of water to avoid fugitive emissions of dust.\n\nCross-media effects\nWater sprinkler\nIncrease in water consumption.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nEconomics\nThe slag concentrator requires:\n\nconsumption of reagents: xanthate ~ 240 g/t; frother ~ 7.5 g/t;\npower consumption for grinding: autogenous mill ~ 18.2 kWh/t; ball mill ~ 14.3 kWh/t.\n\nBuilding a final slag tailing pond (capacity of 1.6 million m3) involved an investment of up to EUR 8 million (2002, Aurubis Pirdop), including pump station, pressure steel duct, and closed circuit water system.\n\nAn upgrade and increase of capacity of the pond to 3.65 million m3, total area 220 acres, involved an investment of EUR 6.5 million (2008, Aurubis Pirdop).\nBuilding 45 new cooling and crystallisation pits involved an investment of EUR 1.350 million (2007-2009, Aurubis Pirdop)\n\nA project for expanding and increasing the capacity of the flotation plant involved an  investment of up to EUR 14 million (2010, Aurubis Pirdop), including for a second autogenous mill and additional flotation cells.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMinimisation of emissions to air and water.\n\nExample plants\nBoliden Harjavalta (FI), Boliden Ronnskar (SE), and Aurubis Pirdop (BG).\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4134527_abstract", "x": 0.7511665, "y": 0.3520973, "title": "METHOD TO CONTROL AN EXHAUST GAS AFTER-TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR AN EXHAUST GAS SYSTEM OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE", "year": 2023, "text": "A method is disclosed to control an exhaust gas aftertreatment system (14) with at least one catalytic converter (15, 17) arranged along an exhaust duct (10) and a burner (21), which is suited to introduce exhaust gases into the exhaust duct (10), wherein inside the burner (21) there is defined a combustion chamber (22), which receives fresh air through an air feeding circuit (23) and fuel from an injector (27); the method comprises housing a temperature and pressure sensor (33, 34) interposed between a pumping device (24) and the burner (21) or leaving the burner (21); acquiring the pressure signal (P33) generated by the combustion inside the combustion chamber (22) and detected by said temperature and pressure sensor (33, 34); and controlling the combustion inside the combustion chamber (22) as a function of said pressure signal (P33).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"9.3.1.4.5\" title=\"Techniques to reduce emissions to air from the carbonyl process\">\n<references_to>2.12.4.3, 2.12.5.1, 2.12.5.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nTechniques to reduce emissions to air from the carbonyl process\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are:\n\ncollection of off-gases (see Section 2.12.4.3);\nafterburner (see Section 2.12.5.2.1);\nbag filter (see Section 2.12.5.1.4).\n\nTechnical description\nThe off-gases from the carbonyl process (containing a carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl mixture and hydrogen) and those from system purges and plant blowdown are collected and piped to a central vent gas manifold. The vent gas manifold then feeds the waste gases in a controlled manner to the combustion chamber for thermal oxidation. \n\nThe combustion chamber comprises an air-cooled steel shell, lined with a heat-resistant refractory material. The combustion chamber is heated by two high-intensity burners, one fuelled by natural gas (fuel burner) and the other by waste gas (residual hydrogen from the kiln reduction stage). The gas burners are identical in design and are mounted tangentially to the furnace; this design promotes a swirling action in the combustion chamber, aiding full combustion. Each of the burners has concentric annuli, one to water-cool the burner and one to admit induced air for quenching the hot gases if required. In the combustion process, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl are mixed with air in the burner and combusted. \n\nThe nickel oxide formed is solid and is in the form of fine dust particulates in the combustion gas stream. The non-toxic waste (purge) hydrogen is fed into to the manifold as a support fuel to the waste gas burner. The pressure of the waste hydrogen is monitored and controlled by a water lute at ground level. In the event of a flame failure, the lute pot is vented to atmosphere via a discharge point. Hydrogen gas reacts as outlined below.\n\nThree basic controls are applied to ensure that the toxic and flammable gases are destroyed without overheating the combustion chamber:\n\nThe primary control is to ensure that a minimum temperature is maintained to oxidise any toxic gases present; this is done by adjusting the gas flow rate to the fuel burner.\nThe second control is designed to ensure that the maximum operating temperature of the combustion chamber does not become too hot for the materials used to construct the furnace. To control this temperature, the primary air directed to the return carbon monoxide burner is increased, and, if that is insufficient, secondary air is admitted to the burner.\nThe third control ensures that the maximum permitted temperature of the gases leaving the combustion chamber is not exceeded; as the temperature approaches the maximum level, a pair of dampers starts to open to admit quench air into the furnace and so dilute the hot gas with cold air.\n\nThe outlet duct of the combustion chamber is fitted with heat-resistant steel blinds. The angle of the blinds can be changed to control the flow rate of combustion gases out of the chamber and, if necessary, to close the outlet ducting. The outlet duct enters an exhaust. The combustion gases and particulates flow through the outlet blinds into the exhaust manifold which feeds into the gas filter system.\n\nThe combustion gas stream is passed through a reverse jet filter system, which consists of filter vessels each with an inlet and outlet damper. Each filter contains filter bags capable of retaining particles of dust down to submicron size, whilst still allowing the passage of the main gaseous stream. The dust filters have a burst bag detection system and are self-cleaning using a reverse jet pulsing system.\n\nThe collected particles descend into bunkers situated below the filters, which are discharged via rotary valves into slurry pots. Here the dust mixes with a continuous flow of water. The resultant slurry is discharged to the refinery effluent treatment plant.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of nickel and carbon dioxide emissions to air.\nRecovery of nickel from the waste gas stream, improving natural resource management.\nReuse of hydrogen waste gas from the carbonyl process as support fuel for the combustion.\nObtaining a stabilised kiln residue that can be further processed by high-pressure nickel extraction.\nFollowing high-pressure nickel extraction, cobalt/copper extraction can be performed.

The continuous caster is only used outside the EU-28, in Japan and Indonesia.\n\nThe most commonly used technique is a casting wheel that comprises a series of anode-shaped moulds on the circumference of a rotating table. Molten metal first flows into a tundish, from where it is directed to an intermediate ladle which fills one or two casting ladles. The casting ladles fill the metal into the moulds and the wheel rotates, taking the anodes through a series of water jets to cool them.\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are:\n\nenclosed tundish;\nclosed intermediate ladle;\nhoods over the casting ladle and (part of) the casting wheel;\nroof extraction combined with treatment in a bag filter;\nscrubber or demister for particulate removal from ventilation gases from the casting wheel.\n\nTechnical description\nA covered tundish, closed intermediate ladle, hoods over the casting ladles and the casting wheel, and roof extraction are used to prevent and reduce diffuse emissions during casting. Hoods and enclosures are maintained with efficient extraction. Collected fumes from the casting area are usually combined with the anode furnace off-gases and subsequently treated in bag filters (see Section 3.3.3.6).\n\nWet ventilation gases from the casting wheel cooling hood are treated in a scrubber or demister for particulate removal. Solids from the scrubber are recycled back to the smelter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of diffuse emissions to air.\nCollected dust/solids are recycled to the smelting process.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAt Atlantic Copper, anode casting is performed with two fully automated casting wheels with 28 and 20 moulds. The casting rate is 70 t/h and 40 t/h. The water vapour produced and captured during casting is sent to a demister for collecting particulates, and the gas (47 000 Nm3/h) is then released into the atmosphere. Dust emissions of between 4 mg/Nm3 and 15 mg/Nm3 are reported. Water to cool the anodes is used in a closed loop system with a cooling tower.\n\nIn Aurubis Hamburg, anode casting is performed with a fully automated single casting wheel with 24 moulds. The casting rate is 80 t/h. The water vapour produced during casting is vented off from the system, particulates are precipitated in a demister and the gas is then released into the atmosphere, containing less than 5 mg/Nm3 solid matter as a daily average. In 2009, a project for collecting and cleaning the fugitive emissions in the anode furnace and casting machine area was completed. Part of the anode casting plant is encapsulated. A reduction of diffuse emissions from the anode furnaces and the anode casting wheel of up to 70 % was achieved by this project. Anode furnace off-gases are treated together with the dry exhaust streams from the casting system in a bag filter with lime milk injection.\n\nIn Aurubis Lunen, the whole anode smelter building is ventilated, and the off-gases are cleaned in bag filter units with a capacity of 300 000 m3/h.\n\nIn Boliden Harjavalta, anode casting is performed with a fully automated single casting wheel with 28 moulds. The casting rate is typically 70 t/h. Ventilation gases from the casting wheel cooling hood are treated in a vortex scrubber for particulate removal at a flow rate of 15 000 Nm3/h. Solids from the scrubber are bled to the anode casting closed cooling water circuit, and recycled batch-wise back to the smelting. Dust measurements after the scrubber are performed twice a year. Levels of 20 mg dust/Nm3 are reported.\n\nIn Metallo-Chimique Beerse, the new casting wheel is a fully automated single casting wheel. Ventilation gases from the casting wheel cooling hood are treated in a bag filter. Levels of dust are maintained below 5 mg/Nm3. Water to cool the anodes is used in a closed loop system. Solid particles from the anode cooling water are allowed to settle and are returned to the furnaces.\n\nIn KGHM Glogow 1 and Legnica, the anode casting is performed with a fully automated twin-wheel casting machine with two lots of 16 moulds. In Glogow 2, there are two casting wheels (a single casting wheel with 28 moulds for stationary anode furnaces and a twin-wheel casting machine with two lots of 18 moulds for rotary anode furnaces). The tapping sections of all anode furnaces have ventilation systems, from which gas is dedusted and desulphurised together with the main stream of anode furnace gases. During the casting process, molten copper from the anode furnace flows through a closed chute and a tundish to a casting area equipped with a ventilation system, from which sucked air loaded only with vapour is discharged through the local stack.\n\nCross-media effects\nIncrease in energy use.\nEffluent water is produced from the scrubbers that needs additional treatment to prevent the discharge of metals to water.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nTechniques for off-gas collection and subsequent filtration systems are applicable for new and existing installations, depending on the design and the availability of space for the casting equipment.\n\nEconomics\nApproximately EUR 7 million were invested at Aurubis Hamburg for measures to capture diffuse emissions from the anode furnace and casting wheel.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of emissions.\nRaw material savings.\n\nExample plants\nAtlantic Copper Huelva (ES), Aurubis Hamburg and Lunen (DE), Boliden Harjavalta (FI), Metallo-Chimique Beerse (BE), KGHM Glogow 1, Glogow 2 and Legnica (Plants Legnica (PL)).\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4245884_abstract", "x": 0.43262538, "y": 0.49368933, "title": "GAS CLEANING METHOD, METHOD OF PROCESSING SUBSTRATE, METHOD OF MANUFACTURING  SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE, AND SUBSTRATE PROCESSING APPARATUS", "year": 2023, "text": "A gas cleaning method includes (a) removing a first metal element as one of contaminants from a process chamber by supplying a chlorine-containing gas into the process chamber (201) without supplying an oxygen-containing gas; and (b) removing a second metal element as another one of the contaminants from the process chamber by supplying the oxygen-containing gas into the process chamber (201), wherein (b) is performed after (a).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"9.3.1.4.4\" title=\"Techniques to reduce emissions from electrowinning\">\n\n<content>\nTechniques to reduce emissions from electrowinning\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are:\n\nonline monitoring of critical process parameters like temperature, flow and use of electricity;\ncollection and reuse of chlorine gas and use of a dimensionally stable anode (Dimensionally Stable Anode (DSA));\ncovering of cells with polystyrene beads to prevent the release of aerosols to air;\nuse of foaming agents to cover the cells with a stable foam layer.\n\nTechnical description\nThe electrowinning process produces gases at the anode and may produce metal-containing acid mist due to bubbles in the electrolyte that burst at the surface of the solution.\n\nDuring chloride-based electrowinning, the chloride ions will be drawn to the anodes and be discharged as chlorine gas. The anode, a so-called dimensionally stable anode (Dimensionally Stable Anode (DSA)), is contained in a diaphragm and enclosed by a collection hood. The chlorine gas collected directly from the anode is blown into a central system and returned to the leaching stage. During the electrowinning, polystyrene beads are used as a cover on top of the cells, to prevent mist from bubbles in the electrolyte solution that burst at the surface from entering the room atmosphere and finally the air. It is important that the entire cell is continuously covered with polystyrene beads. The electrolyte is separated into two phases after passing through the electrowinning tank. Chlorine-containing anolyte from the anodes is transported to a tank for removal of chlorine, and then mixed with the chlorine-free anolyte from the overfall in the electrowinning tank. The chlorine gas is finally reused in the process. \n\nDuring sulphate-based electrowinning, the following reaction takes place: NiSO4 + H2O - Ni + H2SO4 +  1/2  O2. Nickel sulphate solution is fed into the diaphragm bags where cathodes are located. Nickel is precipitated on the cathodes. Sulphate ions react with water and generate sulphuric acid, which is recycled to the leaching stage. Oxygen gas from the anode is released to the workplace environment and via ventilation to the atmosphere. Anode gases contain nickel and acid mists.

It is also important for the furnace energy efficiency.\n\nTin emissions can be avoided if the temperature of the melt in refining and casting operations is below 500 degC. Indeed, as shown in Figure   5 .87, the vapour pressure of tin is very low (negligible compared to lead) up to temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius above the melting point of tin.

To collect the emissions, an extraction hood is placed on the crucible furnace or kettle. Refining kettles can be covered with lids that remain closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Fume extraction should also be used at the launders and tapping points.

Direct heating of the kettle with a gas burner is also applied. Refining kettles are not considered suitable for melting scrap (lead and tin) which contains higher amounts of organic materials. All equipment is installed in a building with additional measures applied to prevent emissions escaping outside.\n\nAt Metallo-Chimique, vacuum distillation is used to separate a lead-tin alloy. Kettles are used for (re)melting and refining. Table   5 .251 shows the dust emissions from these processes.\n\n\nTable 5.251:\tEmissions from the refining process in Metallo-Chimique Beerse\n\n\nAt Aurubis Hamburg and at KGHM's plant in Legnica, refining kettles are covered with lids. Lids are closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Only large blocks/scrap are fed into the furnace. Fume extraction is applied. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Dusty dross/residues are removed by a closed mechanical skimmer and discharged into closed containers. Hoods are installed to capture fumes arising from lead casting. All the collected gases from the refining steps are treated in a centralised bag filter.

The residual heat of the burners is used to produce steam of 10 bar in a boiler. All kettles are provided with closed lids and held in a negative pressure. Dross removal is done automatically under aspiration with a closed skimming system. The air of all dry processes is cleaned in a bag filter.

It is also important for the furnace energy efficiency.\n\nTin emissions can be avoided if the temperature of the melt in refining and casting operations is below 500 degC. Indeed, as shown in Figure   5 .87, the vapour pressure of tin is very low (negligible compared to lead) up to temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius above the melting point of tin. This figure has been created by Metallo-Chimique based on the data mentioned in .\n\n\nFigure 5.87:\tComparison between lead and tin vapour pressures\n\n\nClosed mechanical skimmers to remove dusty dross/residues\nDusty dross/residues are removed by a closed mechanical skimmer and are then discharged in closed containers.\n\nLids, or hoods on the furnaces or kettles with fume extraction (see Section 2.12.4.3)\nA crucible furnace or kettle is applied to melt lead and tin material. To collect the emissions, an extraction hood is placed on the crucible furnace or kettle. Refining kettles can be covered with lids that remain closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Fume extraction should also be used at the launders and tapping points. The collected emissions are subsequently sent to a bag filter, or to a wet scrubber in the case of exhaust gases from wet refining processes or gases containing sticky material, e.g. sodium hydroxide.\n\nVacuum smelting and refining technology\nA lead-tin alloy can also be separated into lead and tin by vacuum distillation at high temperatures.\n\nFor the other techniques, see the sections referred to above.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nTemperature control of the melt\nPrevention of heavy metal emissions and reduction in energy consumption.\n\nClosed mechanical skimmers to remove dusty dross/residues\nPrevention of diffuse emissions.\n\nLids, or hoods on the furnaces or kettles with fume extraction\nReduction of diffuse emissions.\n\nBag filter\nReduction of dust and heavy metal emissions.\nReduction in raw material consumption.\nCollected material is recycled in the smelting process.\n\nWet scrubber\nSee Sections 2.12.5.1.6 and 2.12.5.2.2.\n\nVacuum smelting and refining technology\nReduction of dust and heavy metal emissions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nRemelting, refining and alloying is usually carried out in indirectly heated crucible furnaces or kettles heated by electricity, oil or gas. Direct heating of the kettle with a gas burner is also applied. Refining kettles are not considered suitable for melting scrap (lead and tin) which contains higher amounts of organic materials. All equipment is installed in a building with additional measures applied to prevent emissions escaping outside.\n\nAt Metallo-Chimique, vacuum distillation is used to separate a lead-tin alloy. Kettles are used for (re)melting and refining. Table   5 .251 shows the dust emissions from these processes.\n\n\nTable 5.251:\tEmissions from the refining process in Metallo-Chimique Beerse\n\n\nAt Aurubis Hamburg and at KGHM's plant in Legnica, refining kettles are covered with lids. Lids are closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Only large blocks/scrap are fed into the furnace. Fume extraction is applied. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Dusty dross/residues are removed by a closed mechanical skimmer and discharged into closed containers. Hoods are installed to capture fumes arising from lead casting. All the collected gases from the refining steps are treated in a centralised bag filter. In the cleaned off-gas, levels of dust between 0.5 mg/Nm3 and 10 mg/Nm3 (half-hourly average) and between 0.5 mg/Nm3 and 4.9 mg/Nm3 (daily average) are reported based on continuous measurement.\n\nIn the lead refinery of Umicore Hoboken, impure lead is refined in a series of kettles, which are heated with low-NOX gas burners. The residual heat of the burners is used to produce steam of 10 bar in a boiler. All kettles are provided with closed lids and held in a negative pressure. Dross removal is done automatically under aspiration with a closed skimming system. The air of all dry processes is cleaned in a bag filter. The Sb, Sn and As salts are removed from the lead in the Harris process and treated further in a hydrometallurgical process. Exhaust gases and vapours from these processes, together with the exhaust gases from kettles where sodium hydroxide is used, are cleaned with a wet scrubber.\n\nTable   5 .252 shows emissions data from the refining and casting process.\n\n\nTable 5.252:\tData emissions from refining and casting\n\n\nCross-media effects\nTemperature control of the melt\nNo information provided.\n\nClosed mechanical skimmers to remove dusty dross/residues\nNo information provided.\n\nLids, or hoods on the furnaces or kettles with fume extraction\nNo information provided.\n\nBag filter\nIncrease in energy use.\nTreatment of dust to recover the metals has to be done internally or externally.\n\nWet scrubber\nSee Sections 2.12.5.1.6 and 2.12.5.2.2.\n\nVacuum smelting and refining technology\nNo information provided.\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe techniques listed above are generally applicable.\n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental regulation requirements. \n\nExample plants\nKGHM (Plants Legnica (PL)), Muldenhutten Recycling und Umwelttechnik (DE), BSB Recycling (DE), HJ Enthoven & Sons (UK), Metallo-Chimique (BE), Weser-Metall (DE), Aurubis (DE), and Umicore (BE).\n\nReference literature\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3208538_abstract", "x": 0.7687723, "y": 0.36197084, "title": "COOLING UNIT FOR OXY-BURNER", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention concerns an assembly and a kit of parts comprising:\n(a) An oxy-burner (1) comprising a body extending along a burner body axis, Xb, and comprising a downstream end ending at a free end of the downstream end, said body enclosing a fuel line (1F) and an oxygen line (1Ox) separate from the fuel line, both fuel line and oxygen line having a separate outlet at or adjacent to the free end of the downstream end (1 D) of the oxy-burner, wherein a cross-sectional area normal to Xb of said downstream end of the oxy-burner body decreases towards the free end of the downstream end;\n(b) A cooling unit (3) comprising:\n\u2022 a cooling plate (5) made of a thermally conductive material, defined by a first and a second main surfaces separated by a thickness of said cooling plate, and an aperture extending from a large opening at the first main surface to a narrow opening to the second main surface, wherein the aperture is defined by an aperture wall which geometry matches the geometry of the downstream end of the oxy-burner to form a thermal contact therewith when the downstream end is inserted in the aperture;\n\u2022 a cooling channel (3C) defined by walls and comprising an inlet (3U) and an outlet (3D) for circulating a refrigerating fluid, wherein a cooling wall (5W) of said cooling channel is formed by a portion of the cooling plate.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"2.12.5.2.5\" title=\"Oxy-fuel firing\">\n\n<content>\nOxy-fuel firing\n\nDescription\nThe technique involves the replacement of the combustion air with oxygen, with the consequent elimination/reduction of thermal NOX formation from the nitrogen entering the furnace.

Sedimentation basins, which are commonly used, are rectangular, square or circular. The sludge that is removed from the sedimentation step can be dewatered,  e.g. using a vacuum filter press. The filtrate that is generated may be sent back to the beginning of the effluent treatment process or to the process step where it was generated, depending on the treatment process. Sedimentation can be used to separate solid particles from waste water that has been used for the granulation of slag or the production of metal shot.\n\nAn alternative to sedimentation may be flotation. Flotation can be achieved by dissolved air flotation.

Dry scrubbing is based on the recovery of fluorides by adsorption onto alumina used as the scrubbing agent. The fresh alumina is introduced to a reactor stage together with the process gas from the electrolysis. Most of the adsorption of the gaseous fluorides on the alumina takes place in this reactor stage. The gas and alumina mixture then enters a dust removal system where the alumina enriched with fluoride is separated from the process gas. Most commonly, bag filters are used for dust removal. An additional adsorption is achieved in these bag filters due to the filter cake that is built up on them. The alumina removed from the process gas is used as alumina feed for the electrolysis (so-called secondary or fluorinated alumina).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of total fluorides and dust emissions.\nReduction of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) when Soderberg cells are connected to GTCs.\nFull recovery of fluorinated products which are returned to the pots.\nLower consumption of aluminium fluorides.\nUse of the raw material (alumina) as the cleaning agent, thus mitigating the need for reagents.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPlant-specific emissions were reported both for emissions leaving the Gas Treatment Centre (GTC) (stack emissions) and for total emissions (stack emissions and roof emissions).

For this operation, two Peirce-Smith converters are used in a two-step operation with slag recycling. The nickel-containing matte is further processed in another French plant for the production of high-purity nickel salts and nickel metal using chloride leaching and electrowinning. Iron is removed as ferric chloride by solvent extraction and some cobalt chloride is also extracted.\n\nDuring blowing, the process gas is expelled from the converter and is captured. The extraction fan control is adjusted to keep the pressure at the mouth of the converter below atmospheric pressure to avoid gas from escaping outside the fume extraction system. The fume extraction system is connected to bag filters further downstream. During settling or tapping periods, the gas exhaust equipment is also adjusted to avoid emission into the converter bay.\n\nThe exhaust gas is then cooled down by a heat exchanger under natural or forced convection and the collected dust filtered by a bag filter. \n\nSO2 emissions are not an issue as their concentrations in the process fumes are insignificant due to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the process.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMetal-rich dust can be collected from the emissions to air and recycled in the ore smelting process.\nParticulate emissions to air are significantly reduced.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nDust emission levels lower than 15 mg/Nm3 were reported.\n\nLiquid effluents are of little importance because the gas treatment process is a dry process and the formation of liquid waste only results from the cooling of certain parts of the equipment (condensation).\n\nThe largest quantity of waste is solid slag which amounts to some 75 000 tonnes for an annual nickel matte production of 15 000 tonnes. Slag is tapped from the 60-tonne converter and then transported to a dedicated area where it is allowed to cool down to ambient temperature. Finally, this slag (categorised as waste) is transferred to a dedicated storage area.\n\nDust from the management of emissions to air is collected downstream. This dust, which is mostly composed of metallic and non-metallic oxides (FeO, NiO, MgO and SiO2), is collected in bag filters. The dust requires a specific treatment to be consolidated for further reintroduction into the process (at an earlier step into the ore smelter). Among the different binder options, concrete may be used as it is easy to handle and operate.\n\nOther solid waste materials which are produced in the converting process are ladle skulls and scrap.

Gases are cooled down, dedusted in a fabric filter and the gases are passed to the desulphurisation system. After desulphurisation, the gases are sent to a two-stage drift eliminator and then to the stack. Gypsum is recovered from the slurry produced by the Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) and is sold.\nIn this case, the circulating suspension of limestone is pumped from separate tanks equipped with mechanical stirrers; the scrubber tank also has an aeration system. The tanks are sized to allow complete reaction of the absorbed SO2 with the CaCO3 suspension, oxidation of sulphur compounds to sulphates, and the formation of a coarse crystalline residue of synthetic gypsum, CaSO4*2H2O. Compressed air is delivered to the scrubber tank through a pneumo-hydraulic aerator to improve the oxidation of sulphites to sulphates. The reaction slimes from the first absorption stage, containing mainly calcium sulphate (gypsum), are sent to a filtration system. The gypsum, after dehydration in a filtration press, is unloaded directly into a storage container located under the press, from where it is transported to a warehouse, and then sold.\n\nOther scrubbing processes for gases with a low SO2 content are described in Sections 2.12.5.2.2 and 2.12.5.2.3.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of SO2 emissions. SO2 removal efficiencies range from 50 % to 95 %. Removal rates at the higher end of this range are only possible in ideal conditions in newly designed, dedicated installations.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPerformance data are given in the metal-specific chapters.\n\nFor the Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system reportedly used in a Waelz furnace installation and in an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) when using Waelz oxide, a final SO2 concentration range of 100-500 mg/Nm3 is achieved with an Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) input containing 2-6 g of SO2/Nm3. A final SO2 concentration of 50-400 mg/Nm3 is reported as the best performance, , . \n\nCross-media effects\nAdditional use of energy and calcium carbonate.\nIf the sale of clean gypsum is not possible then waste will be produced.\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to new plants. When using existing gas-cleaning equipment with a fabric filter that is designed to remove process dust, it can be used to capture gypsum if the filter capacity allows for this. When a filter is already used, direct injection is possible when temperature, moisture content and contact time are sufficient. An existing filter installation might be insufficient, as the amount of dust increases drastically and thus it might need to be replaced.\n\nThe Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system reported to be used in a Waelz furnace installation and in an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) when using Waelz oxide is applicable to all processes that have a Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) input that contains 2-15 g SO2/Nm3 (approximately 0.05-0.5 %) provided that there is a market for the gypsum that is produced.\n\nEconomics\nLime injection plants' investment costs are reported in the metal-specific chapters.\n\nFor the Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system reportedly used in a Waelz furnace installation and in an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) when using Waelz oxide, with a capacity of 85 000 Nm3/h and an average inlet SO2 content of 15 g/Nm3, the capital cost in 2008 was PLN 14 million which is equivalent to EUR 4 million. The operating cost is approximately EUR 2100 per day.\n\nDriving forces for implementation\nReduction of SO2 emissions.\n\nExample plants\nLime injection: Hoboken (BE), Beerse (BE), Hamburg (DE), and Bergsoe (SE).\nOther Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) techniques: Miasteczko Slaskie and Boleslaw (Plants Legnica (PL)).\nReference literature\n,  \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3542913_abstract", "x": 0.7026468, "y": 0.40184382, "title": "COMPACT DEDUSTING APPARATUS", "year": 2019, "text": "A compact dedusting apparatus (10) induces air flow through the housing (12) by a vacuum generator (30) mounted within the housing.

To produce a by-product or reduce the amount of wastes generated from these constituents, the following techniques need to be considered.\n\nSulphur recovery: Sulphur is converted to sulphur products such as sulphuric acid, or liquid SO2.\nCd removal: Cd is leached from the dust recovered by a hot ESP using sulphuric acid.\nHg removal: Hg is removed using either the Boliden-Norzink process or filtration with absorbents such as activated carbon.\nSe and Te separation: Se and Te are removed during (wet or dry) gas cleaning. The residues that are formed are landfilled or reused to extract these metals.\nAg, Au, Bi, Sb and Cu recovery: These metals are removed during refining as a complex element and sent to the recovery stage.\nMetals recovery in a waste water treatment plant.\nOther constituents are processed to produce oxides for recycling, or a crystalline slag.\n\nTechnical description\nGood waste management practices either enable minimisation of waste material or ensure the waste is transformed into a less harmful material. This can occur via a number of routes, which include concentrating, removing, stabilising, or recycling the undesired components, or by optimisation of the flocculation/filtration conditions to ensure less water in the residue that needs treatment.\n\nLead ores and concentrates can contain constituents such as S, Fe, CaO, Zn, Cu, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and BaO, and, in more minor concentrations, Ag, As, Au, Bi, Cd, Hg, Sb, Se and Te. Secondary materials used are typically clean materials (i.e. lead paste from battery processing), but may contain Cu or Sb (scrap, grids, etc.).\n\nSulphur recovery\nSulphur is converted to sulphur dioxide, which can be used to generate marketable/reusable sulphur-containing products (i.e. sulphuric acid, liquid SO2, or gypsum). This avoids the generation of waste, which otherwise would have resulted from its abatement, see Section 2.12.5.4.\n\nCd removal\nDuring smelting, Cd is fumed and is precipitated by the hot ESP. To recover dust with a high lead content, Cd has to be separated out. This is done by a leaching process using sulphuric acid, and Cd is precipitated as CdCO3. After a filter press, this material is sent to a suitable landfill. The leaching residue is returned to the furnace process.\n\nSe and Te separation and Hg removal\nDuring wet gas cleaning, Se, Te and some Hg are removed. The complex residue is sent to landfill or used for metal recovery. Residual Hg in the process gas is removed by special processes (e.g. Boliden-Norzink process, Dowa process, or filtration with absorbents such as activated carbon), see Section 2.12.5.5, and the residues are treated and sent to landfill.\n\nAg, Au, Bi, Zn and Sb and some Cu recovery\nThese metals are removed during gas cleaning or refining. These metals can be processed to form oxides (e.g. ZnO) and/or an Ag-Au alloy, Pb-Bi alloy, Pb-Sb alloy or Cu matte for own use or sale. This can take place either on or off site. A small quantity of intermediates and/or wastes produced during the refining process are sent back to the smelting process or refinery for internal recycling.\n\nMetals recovery in a waste water treatment plant\nSome of the metals are discharged after treatment to the waste water treatment plant (Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)), see Section 5.3.6.2. The treatment residues from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) are recirculated.\n\nAll other components of the lead ore/concentrate go to slag. A crystalline slag is produced which will contain some lead and other metals. The composition of the slag can be controlled before smelting by the addition of fluxes (some of which are waste materials) to achieve a material with good leaching properties. Compounds which are considered low value may be collected as a by-product (with a Pb concentration of > 40 %) to be sold to other smelters. In some cases, slags containing Pb, Zn and Cu are further fumed to recover value in downstream processes and to produce a slag that is low in metal and has low leachability and can potentially be used for construction processes.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRecovery of materials.\nMinimisation of environmental risks associated with waste materials going to landfill.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNo information provided.\n\nCross-media effects\nSulphur recovery\nIncrease in energy use.\nUse of additives.\nWaste could be generated.\n\nCd removal\nUse of additives.\nWaste is produced that will require disposal.\n\nHg removal\nIncrease in energy use.\nWaste is produced that will require disposal.\n\nSe and Te separation\nIncrease in energy use.\nWaste will be produced if Se and Te are not recovered.\nAg, Au, Bi, Sb and Cu recovery\nNo information provided.\n\nMetals recovery in a waste water treatment plant\nNo information provided. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.

Using closed equipment such as closed mixing tanks, closed settlers and a closed storage tank feed in a closed circuit minimises the possible emission of VOCs. The minimisation of diffuse emissions can also be achieved by selecting a process reagent (solvent) with a lower steam pressure.\n\nTreatment of the purge from the solvent extraction process in a waste water treatment plant before discharge\nThe principal liquid effluent generated in the solvent extraction stage is the secondary raffinate. This effluent originates from the bleeding and is required in the hydrometallurgical process to prevent impurities accumulating in the solvent extraction, leaching and electrowinning circuits. This effluent is sent to the waste water treatment plant, where metals are precipitated as hydroxides and sulphate. The resulting water flow is discharged into the receiving media.\n\nTreatment of the residues (crud) to recover the organic solution content\nA residue known as crud is generated in the solvent extraction step. Crud is a stable emulsion made up of suspended solids, aqueous solution and organic solution, and it forms in the phase between the organic and aqueous solutions in the solvent extraction settlers.\n\nTo remove the solids from the crud, this residue is sent to a treatment plant where the crud pulp is pumped from the settlers and passed through a clay filter to separate the solids fraction from the remaining phases. The slurry from the clay filter is circulated back into the crud collection tank (where the treatment starts) until the solution is free of solids. The phases are allowed to separate in the tank, with the aqueous and organic solutions taken separately from the tank. The aqueous solution is pumped to the primary raffinate after-settler, in order to recover the organic solution, which is returned to the loaded organic tank.\n\nUse of centrifugation for the treatment of the slurry from cleaning and settlers\nThe slurry from cleaning the settlers (aqueous phase, crud and organic phase) is centrifuged to separate the solid from the liquid phase (solvent and water).

Concentrate treatment may cause some dust residues that are recycled and mixed with concentrates. When dust is too fine, a pretreatment such as micropelletising may be required. None of the residues produced in this process need special treatment. The roasting process is almost entirely enclosed. Due to the enclosure, process residues and waste flows are minimised. \n\nMercury is removed from the roasting gas and a mercury-containing residue is precipitated. This residue is mixed in weak acid and is separated by filtration. After separation, this residue can be stabilised and disposed of. Alternatively, this residue can be treated further by distillation to produce pure metallic mercury. In the Boliden-Norzink process, a saleable metallic mercury is produced if electrowinning is included. If electrowinning is not included, stable mercury compounds can be discarded via secure disposal. None of the EU-28 zinc smelters using the Boliden-Norzink process produce metallic mercury by electrowinning; mercury produced in the NFM process is classified as waste and has to be stabilised and disposed of according to valid legislation (e.g. landfill or salt mine). The volume of produced mercury-containing waste can be decreased significantly by distillation.\n\nThe amount of removed mercury is fully dependent on the mercury concentration range in the raw material. A typical range may be 0.2-0.6 kg/t Zn (residue after filtration) or 0.05-0.2 kg/t Zn of pure distilled metallic mercury.\n\nResidues formed in the hydrometallurgical leaching and purification route are precipitated in different process steps. The amount of precipitates depends mainly on the quality of the concentrates and the efficiency of the precipitation. One of the main residue fractions in the hydrometallurgical process route is iron residue (in the form of jarosite or goethite). Iron residue is mainly disposed of to landfill according to valid legislation (landfill regulation, environmental permit). The amount of iron residue produced is partially dependent on the precipitate type (goethite or jarosite), but more significantly dependent on the iron concentration in the concentrates. There are no techniques to minimise this amount. Low-iron concentrates may be used to avoid iron residue, but the availability of this type of concentrate is very limited. In the EU, there is only one plant which exclusively processes low-iron concentrates. To ensure this, it has signed long-term contracts with a large mine that has low-iron concentrates: the Century mine in Australia.

Concentrate treatment may cause some dust residues that are recycled and mixed with concentrates. When dust is too fine, a pretreatment such as micropelletising may be required. None of the residues produced in this process need special treatment. The roasting process is almost entirely enclosed. Due to the enclosure, process residues and waste flows are minimised. \n\nMercury is removed from the roasting gas and a mercury-containing residue is precipitated. This residue is mixed in weak acid and is separated by filtration. After separation, this residue can be stabilised and disposed of. Alternatively, this residue can be treated further by distillation to produce pure metallic mercury. In the Boliden-Norzink process, a saleable metallic mercury is produced if electrowinning is included. If electrowinning is not included, stable mercury compounds can be discarded via secure disposal. None of the EU-28 zinc smelters using the Boliden-Norzink process produce metallic mercury by electrowinning; mercury produced in the NFM process is classified as waste and has to be stabilised and disposed of according to valid legislation (e.g. landfill or salt mine). The volume of produced mercury-containing waste can be decreased significantly by distillation.\n\nThe amount of removed mercury is fully dependent on the mercury concentration range in the raw material. A typical range may be 0.2-0.6 kg/t Zn (residue after filtration) or 0.05-0.2 kg/t Zn of pure distilled metallic mercury.\n\nResidues formed in the hydrometallurgical leaching and purification route are precipitated in different process steps. The amount of precipitates depends mainly on the quality of the concentrates and the efficiency of the precipitation. One of the main residue fractions in the hydrometallurgical process route is iron residue (in the form of jarosite or goethite). Iron residue is mainly disposed of to landfill according to valid legislation (landfill regulation, environmental permit). The amount of iron residue produced is partially dependent on the precipitate type (goethite or jarosite), but more significantly dependent on the iron concentration in the concentrates. There are no techniques to minimise this amount. Low-iron concentrates may be used to avoid iron residue, but the availability of this type of concentrate is very limited. In the EU, there is only one plant which exclusively processes low-iron concentrates. To ensure this, it has signed long-term contracts with a large mine that has low-iron concentrates: the Century mine in Australia. Since the Century mine is close to depletion, it will become very difficult in the future to operate a zinc refinery exclusively on low-iron concentrates.\n\nElements other than zinc present in the plant feed need to be extracted and removed in order to achieve a pure zinc product and to avoid a build-up of such elements in the closed hydrometallurgical circuit.

Raw materials contain varying concentrations of impurities that have to be precipitated and extracted in certain process steps. Some residues are registered as transported or on-site isolated intermediates according to the REACH regulation and are used as raw or construction materials in internal or external processes. The residues that cannot be reused are classified as waste and disposed of after appropriate treatment (stabilisation) to landfill according to environmental regulation requirements.\n\nResidues formed in smelting processes are mainly iron- and silica-based slag. Usually slags contain very low concentrations of leachable metals and therefore they can be used in construction, abrasives and other purposes. The slag output is four to ten times the weight of the metal produced. The slag which cannot be reused is disposed of to landfill.\n\nResidues formed in the hydrometallurgical leaching and purification route are precipitated in different process steps. The amount of precipitates depends mainly on the quality of the raw materials and the efficiency of the precipitation. One of the main residue fractions in the hydrometallurgical process route is iron residue (in the form of jarosite or goethite). Iron residue is mainly disposed of to landfill. The amount of iron residue produced depends entirely on the iron concentration in the raw materials. Elements other than nickel present in the plant feed need to be extracted and removed in order to achieve a pure nickel product and to avoid a build-up of such elements in the closed hydrometallurgical circuit. Some of the extracted elements are concentrated in saleable on-site isolated or transported intermediates and are registered according to the REACH regulation.\n\nResidues from the gas treatment plant are mixed with water (very fine nickel powders are potentially pyrophoric so wetting them is a safety measure) to form a slurry which is fed directly to the on-site waste water treatment plant for treatment and recovery. Dry effluent residue from the waste water treatment plant is sent to the smelter for metal recovery.

Use of low shear mixing also reduces the formation of stable emulsion precipitate wastes referred to as cruds in solvent extraction processes.\nUse of a high shear mixer. \nThe mixer-settler units are sealed to prevent VOC emissions to the workplace environment.\n\nTechnical description\nA hydrometallurgical solvent extraction process in which the cobalt(II) ions in the aqueous feed solution are selectively separated and concentrated from a process solution typically containing mostly nickel. Aqueous feed containing the cobalt is mixed in a liquid-liquid contactor with an organic solution containing an extraction chemical that forms an organometallic complex with the cobalt, resulting in its dissolution into the organic stream. As the cobalt extraction chemicals are typically acidic ion exchangers, acid is generated during the extraction reaction, which necessitates the control of pH with an alkaline neutralising agent, e.g. ammonia or sodium hydroxide. The cobalt-loaded organic phase will contain some co-extracted impurities since the extraction chemicals are not entirely selective to the target metal and a scrubbing step follows, where impurities are removed by mixing the organic phase with an aqueous solution typically containing cobalt. The cobalt is then stripped from the organic phase back to an aqueous solution by reversing the extraction reaction by mixing with aqueous solution at a lowered pH, which breaks up the organic complex and liberates the cobalt ions. The stripped organic solvent is then returned to the extraction stage.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMinimisation of VOC emissions to air.\nReduced formation of solid waste.\n \nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNo information provided.\n\nCross-media effects\nIncrease in energy consumption.\nUse of ammonia for neutralisation of extraction chemicals and generation of ammonium sulphate. It is necessary to make purified water for the washing and stripping stages.\nUse of acid for stripping of cobalt.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSeparation of cobalt by solvent extraction is applied to processes treating nickel-containing raw materials that also contain cobalt. To obtain a high-purity product, zinc, iron, calcium, manganese and copper should be removed from the feed solution prior to the solvent extraction of cobalt. A chemical neutralisation step is used to adjust pH levels in the extraction and washing stages. Cobalt is recovered as a highly concentrated, high-purity solution suitable as a feed for cobalt electrowinning for example. \n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSelective cobalt separation yielding a high-purity product.\nLow energy and chemical consumption.\nLow waste generation.\n\nExample plants\nNorilsk Nickel Harjavalta (FI), OMG Kokkola Chemicals (FI), Murrin Murrin (Australia), Kasese Cobalt Company (Uganda), Knightsbridge Cobalt (South Africa), and Anglo Platinum Rustenburg Base Metals Refinery (South Africa).\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3372469_abstract", "x": 0.6411673, "y": 0.6258844, "title": "DOOR APPARATUS AND THE VEHICLE EQUIPPED THEREWITH", "year": 2018, "text": "The door apparatus (10) is provided with an opening frame (30) defining an opening (130) and a door (20) for operating between a first door position and a second door position, the door (20) making contact with the opening frame (30) when at the first door position, the door (20) being separated from the opening frame (30) when at the second door position.

For input material with substantial organic contaminants, e.g. coating, oil and paint, the furnace is provided with excess air or oxygen to burn off the pyrolysed organic compounds. This both utilises the organic contaminants for heat generation and at the same time reduces the amount of organic carbon emissions in the flue-gas. If needed, an afterburner could be used to fully convert the organic carbon into CO2.\n\nHood and sealed furnace door\nA furnace door is designed to cope with the heat inside and the cool ambient air outside. It must be easy to operate and properly sealed to maintain the positive pressure inside the furnace. The hood is designed to prevent any leakage of fumes into the environment when the furnace door is open (for example during the charging) and to collect diffuse emissions.\n\nReverberatory furnace: One of the modern designs of the furnace door comprises a sturdy frame made of individual sections of heat-resistant castings. The frame is embedded in the refractory material to a high degree so that the area for heat transfer is very small. The door frame also carries the sealing system. For sealing, a heat-resistant asbestos-free mineral wool rope is used. The rope holders are made of individual sections and allow adjustment of the sealing as necessary.

The preheating ramp is located here. As the flue-gas passes this area, a good heat transfer is assured. The flue duct may also be located elsewhere and still enable a good heat distribution in the furnace.

At startup, NOx emissions are higher (varying from 600 - 2000 ppm/1230 - 4100 mg NOx /m3) for the first 10 - 45 minutes, giving an extra emission of 100 - 1000 kg NOx/year. Shutdown results are in the same range as NOx concentrations (600 - 2000 ppm/1230 - 4100 mg NOx/m3) for 10 - 30 minutes, giving a maximum extra emission of 500 kg NOx/year. \n\nDuring normal operation, the percentage NO2 in the NOx varies between 50 - 75 %. Especially during startup, the NO2 emission is larger than the Nitric Oxide (NO) emission (70 % NO2, 30 % Nitric Oxide (NO)), colouring the stack gas reddish-brown or yellow. The visual appearance of this stack gas often results in complaints from people in the locality. This is a local problem and therefore will not be described in detail.\n\nVarious techniques are available to reduce NOX emissions during startup and shutdown, but investments are often high compared to the amount of NOx reduction achievable. Extra NOx emissions due to startup and shutdown are less than 1 % of the overall NOx emissions during a year. The measures could be considered to reduce the visual appearance of a fume. \n\nPotential end-of-pipe measures during startup include:\n\nHeating the tail gas. A furnace, steam heater or separate burner could be used to heat the tail gas. Operated between 180 and 450 degC, at the optimum for SCR/NSCR, this measure will reduce NOx at an earlier stage and minimise the startup period.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Installing an SCR facility with a large temperature range will allow NOX reduction at lower temperatures (from 180 degC and higher) and as a result, down-times for the SCR will reduce.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. Excessive emissions at startup can be minimised by the use of caustic, sodium carbonate or ammonia alkali scrubber.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry adsorbent material. NOx reduction at startup can be achieved by using a dry adsorbent, e.g. silica gel or molecular sieves.\n\nThe above procedures are less suitable during shutdowns, as pressure and temperature quickly reduce.\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \n\nHeating the tail gas. Exact figures are not known, but a NOx reduction of at least 70 % during part of the startup can be expected.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Exact figures are not known. Despite the lower temperature (from 180 degC and higher), some extra emissions during startup will take place, but for a shorter period of time. During the period that the SCR facility operates, a NOx reduction of 80 - 95 % can be obtained.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. Exact figures are not known, but a NOX reduction of at least 70 % during startup can be expected.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry absorbent material. Figures are not known but a NOX reduction of at least 70 % during startup can be expected.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nHeating the tail gas. Energy is required to raise the temperature to the optimum needed for the SCR or NSCR facility.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. The NH3 added to the SCR and the nitrous gases in the tail gas could react to form ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite when the tail gas passes through an SCR as a result of these unstable process conditions and low temperatures during startup. Deposits of these salts could potentially cause an explosion. The temperature of the tail gas must be 180 degC or higher when the SCR is started, to minimise the risk.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. A large amount of water vapour will escape from the scrubber liquid due to the high tail gas temperature when an SCR is used at between 200 and 350 degC. As a result, water consumption is high. The used scrubber fluid cannot be re-used, and it has to be disposed of as waste.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry adsorbent material. The spent adsorbent material is a waste for disposal.\n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo specific information provided.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nHeating the tail gas. A tail gas heating unit needs lots of space, particularly when enclosed, but can be applied in new and existing nitric acid plants with an SCR or an NSCR. Energy is needed to raise the temperature to the optimum needed for the SCR or NSCR facility, i.e. 180 to 450 degC.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Enough space should be available to install this facility. When the old catalyst is replaced, the new one should fit into the facility. \n\nInstalling a scrubber. There must be enough space to place the rather large scrubber facility.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry adsorbent material. Free space must be available and sufficient to install an adsorber facility. The high temperatures that are necessary before the SCR can be started, i.e. 200 - 350 degC, could damage the adsorbent.\n\n\nEconomics\n\nGenerally, most end-of-pipe technologies to reduce startup and shutdown emissions are quite expensive in comparison to the NOx reduction. \n\nHeating the tail gas. Equipment costs for a burner are approximately NLG 200000 (about EUR 91000). Installing a furnace (equipment and engineering) will cost at least NLG 1000000 (EUR 450000). Other economics are not known.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Capital costs of a complete SCR facility are at least NLG 1000000 (about EUR 450000). To reduce only the startup emissions, the costs of an SCR are unacceptable in most cases. Other economics are not known.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. Since water cannot be used as a scrubber fluid (the NOx turns the tail gas acid, so an alkaline scrubber liquid is required), the annual costs of the scrubber are expected to be considerable, although the exact figures are not known.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry absorbent material. Annual costs are expected to be considerable, since the saturated absorbent material has to be replaced regularly.

After dust removal, the warm air is then recycled as dilution air to the dryer combustion system, replacing ambient air. Good experience has been reported in a number of plants that have switched to this type of system. This system has proven feasible in both dry (Western US) and humid (US Gulf Coast) climates, however, the moisture content of the recycled air is a sensitive factor that must be carefully evaluated.\n\n\nFigure   7 .53 gives an overview of the change over from the conventional setup to the optimised setup. Primary components of this revised configuration are as follows:\n\nremoval of old equipment and ductwork\nnew fabric filter (or high efficiency cyclones)\nnew \"recycle air\" fan (if the existing unit is not available or not sufficient)\nrevised ductwork.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.53: Overview of the recycling of warm air\n[54, Snyder, 2003]\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n\nIn general, a dry recovery system is expected to be a simplified, more efficient operation with reduced pluggage, corrosion, and resultant maintenance. Specific benefits from a warm air recycle system are as follows:\nrecovered heat from warm air results in fuel savings at the dryer\nvarious benefits due to reduced volume flow in the scrubber system, e.g. as follows:\n\nreduced fan power (lower pressure drop associated with fabric filter or cyclones)\nreduced scrubber circulation pump power\nreduced make-up water requirement (and resultant evaporation required)\nreduced fluoride emissions associated with reduced wet gas flow to atmosphere.\n\nThe total dryer fuel savings are estimated to be in the range of 6 - 12 % which translates to approximately USD 0.1 - 0.2 per tonne. The total power savings are estimated to be approximately 2 kWh per tonne or USD 0.1 per tonne.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nThe technique requires a specific burner design, and higher NOx emissions can be expected (still below 200 mg/Nm3 NOx at 3 % O2 [52, infoMil, 2001].\n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo specific data provided.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nGenerally applicable to all kinds of fertilisers. The problems with implementation/use of this technique have resulted in changing back to the original configuration in the plants of Fertiberia (Huelva) and BASF (Ludwigshafen). The main reasons for this were increased clogging in the equipment and increased maintenance cost [154, Technical Working Group (TWG) on LVIC-AAF, 2006].\n\nWhen recycling warm air within Ammonium Nitrate (AN)/Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) production, safety issues should be taken into consideration [154, Technical Working Group (TWG) on LVIC-AAF, 2006].\n\n\nEconomics\n\nThe total installed cost for a warm air recycle system for a 100 tonnes per hour plant is estimated to be USD 600000 - 1000000. The economic justification for this option increases significantly if scrubber repair, upgrade, or replacement is already needed. \n\nThe example plant achieves fuel savings of about EUR 61000 per year (based on a price of EUR 0.14/m3 of natural gas).\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nCost benefits through fuel savings.\n\n\nReferences to literature and example plants\n\n[52, infoMil, 2001, 54, Snyder, 2003], AMFERT, Amsterdam, AMI, Linz\n\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2940006_abstract", "x": 0.6258743, "y": 0.22406878, "title": "Process and plant for the synthesis of urea and melamine", "year": 2015, "text": "An integrated process for the synthesis of urea and melamine, wherein: urea is synthesized with a stripping process in a high-pressure synthesis loop comprising a reactor, a stripper and a carbamate condenser, and the urea solution leaving said stripper is sent to a recovery section to produce a concentrated urea product and a recovered carbamate solution; at least part of said urea product is converted to melamine, and the off-gas from the synthesis of melamine are recycled to the urea synthesis by mixing with the gas phase from the stripper and with said recovered carbamate solution, thus forming a mixed flow which is then condensed in said carbamate condenser, and the condensate is eventually directed to the reactor.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"8.4.9\" title=\"Combined condensation and reaction in one vessel\">\n<referenced_by>8.5</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nCombined condensation and reaction in one vessel\n\nDescription\n\nBasically, with combined condensation and reaction in one vessel, two configurations are possible:\n\nstripper   +   combined condenser/pre-reactor   +   reactor (rather as revamp option)\nstripper   +   combined condenser/reactor (rather for new plants).\n\nPool reactor. The stripper off-gases are condensed in a horizontal submerged condenser, which is an intrinsic part of the urea reactor. In this way, two complete process steps, i.e. condensation and dehydration can be combined in one vessel. The CO2 stripper is left unchanged. However, the stripper off-gases along with the recycled carbamate solution and the ammonia feed are introduced into the pool reactor. The liquid phase is thoroughly agitated by the gases from the stripper. The heat of condensation is used for aiding the dehydration reaction and for generating steam in the tube bundle. The pressure of the generated steam controls the rate of condensation. The part of the pool reactor that is equipped with the tube bundle is the condensing part of the reactor, while the other section can be called the reaction part. The pressure at the shell side of the reactor is 140 bar, the temperature at the reactor outlet is 185 C [52, infoMil, 2001, 124, Stamicarbon, 2004].\n\nPool condenser. It is also possible to install only a pool condenser. Basically, the pool condenser is a horizontal vessel with a submerged U-tube bundle. It is fabricated from carbon steel with internals and lining in stainless steel. Strip gases are condensed in a pool of liquid on the shell side, with low pressure steam being generated on the tube side. Applying an adequate residence time allows the reaction of ammonium carbamate to urea and water to proceed up to 60 % of equilibrium. The condensation temperature on the shell side is high as a result of the formation of high boiling components of urea and water, resulting in a higher temperature differential for the exchanger. The formation of gas bubbles ensures a high degree of turbulence and provides a large area for mass and heat transfer. Both phenomena contribute to a higher heat transfer [52, infoMil, 2001, 124, Stamicarbon, 2004]. \n\nVertical submerged carbamate condenser (VSCC/ACES21). The stripped gases from the stripper are led to a vertical submerged carbamate condenser, where NH3 and CO2 condense to form ammonium carbamate and urea on its shell side. The condensation heat is recovered to generate low pressure steam on the tube side. A packed bed for scrubbing is provided at the top of the carbamate condenser to absorb uncondensed NH3 and CO2 into recycled carbamate solution (coming from the medium pressure section). Urea is partly formed in the carbamate condenser and the reaction is completed in the reactor [122, Toyo, 2002, 123, Toyo, 2003]. \n\nTechnical advantages of the combined condenser/reactor are:\n\nthe heat transfer in the reactor/condenser bundle is much better than in falling film condensers \nthe baffles in the reactor prevent back-mixing \nthe inverse response of the synthesis loop is eliminated\nthe synthesis is much less sensitive to deviations in the N/C ratio.\n\nTechnical advantages of the combined condenser/pre-reactor are:\n\nthe urea reactor volume is reduced, or the capacity of the reactor is increased accordingly \nless heat exchange area\nthe horizontal arrangement offers a structural alternative\nless stress corrosion\nhigher operational flexibility.\nAchieved environmental benefits \n\nwhen a pool reactor is used, an ammonia emission in the synthesis phase of 2.5 g/tonne product (<700 mg/m3) is achievable\nsome potential for energy saving. \n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo specific information provided. \n\n\nApplicability\n\nThe combined condenser/reactor is applicable mainly for new plants.

Fluoride is distributed between the product acid, gypsum, vapours generated in the reactor and the acid concentration section during processing. Initially, fluoride is released in the reaction as hydrogen fluoride (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)), but in the presence of silica it reacts readily to form fluosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and compounds such as MgSiF6 and H3AlF6. The fluosilicic acid may decompose with heating to give volatile silicon tetrafluoride and hydrogen fluoride.\n\nIn a dihydrate (DH) process the temperature is usually too low to cause the decomposition of fluosilicic acid. The majority of fluorine compounds will be evolved with the evaporator vapours during concentration of the weak phosphoric acid. In the hemihydrate (HH) process, most of the fluoride is released during the reaction. Fluoride leaves the reactor with the vacuum cooler condenser water or with the cooling air, depending on the cooling system used (flash cooler or air circulating cooler). To prevent fluoride emissions with condenser water, the application of an indirect condensation system may be considered instead of a direct contact condenser, thus avoiding that condenser water becoming contaminated with fluoride. A typical fluoride distribution in the dihydrate process and hemihydrate process is shown in Table   5 .70.\n\n\nTable 5.70: Typical fluoride distribution in DH and HH processes\n[31, EFMA, 2000]\n\n\nFluoride can be removed by a number of different scrubbing systems (see also Section 6.4.6). Vapours from vacuum flash coolers and vacuum evaporators are usually first led through a separator for the removal of phosphoric acid droplets that are entrained with the vapours to minimise fluosilicic acid contamination with P2O5, or something just to minimise contamination of the scrubber effluent.\n\nIf the fluorine is not recovered, the scrubber effluent will be discharged. The effluent can be neutralised with lime or limestone to precipitate fluorine as solid calcium fluoride before discharge (see also Section 6.4.9). \n\nMany companies recover the fluorine as fluosilicic acid (H2SiF6), which can be used for the production of aluminium fluoride, and other fluorine compounds such as sodium and/or potassium fluosilicates. In this case, a dilute solution of fluosilicic acid is used as the scrubbing liquid. The reaction to fluosilicic acid results in the formation of free silica. By carefully controlling the fluosilic acid strength, silica deposition is controlled. The silica is then removed by filtration. Usually, a product containing 20 - 25 % fluosilicic acid is recovered in the fluoride recovery system. \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n\nwith two or more absorbers a recovery efficiency of 99 % or more can be achieved. According to [31, EFMA, 2000], achievable fluoride emission levels for new plants are 5 mg/Nm3 (40 g/tonne P2O5). In the Netherlands, emission levels of 1 - 5 mg/Nm3 were achieved [29, RIZA, 2000]\nrecovery of fluosilicic acid (H2SiF6) with potential for valorisation (see Section 6.4.4), for production of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) from fluosilicic acid, see Section 6.4.10.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nWater, energy and chemicals consumption for scrubbing.\n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo information provided.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nGenerally applicable.

The gasifier slag is separated in a molten state through the bottom of the gasifier, cooled in a bath of water and extracted using lock hoppers. Slag can be removed continuously from the slag bath at the base of the gasifier via a let-down system, which seems to show benefits in relation to lock hopper systems. The quality - and hence the reuse potential - of the gasification slags may be better than that of the corresponding combustion ashes due to their glassy and chemically stable form. \n\nSour gas is converted to solid sulphur in a Claus unit, and tail gas from the Claus unit is hydrogenated before being recycled to the COS hydrolysis unit, allowing recovery of 98 % of the total fuel sulphur content as elemental sulphur. Sulphur can also be recovered as gypsum, e.g. by washing with a limestone solution. The plant includes a syngas cooler, hot gas filter and cold gas clean-up using COS hydrolysis and MDEA for H2S removal. The H2S-rich gas is burnt and the flue-gases scrubbed with limestone slurry to produce gypsum for sale. This technique has been developed where there is very little market for elemental sulphur, like in Japan.\n\nDepending on the market situation, slag and recovered sulphur are likely to be traded. The slag can be used in the manufacturing of flooring tiles for example, and sulphur can be used in the manufacture of fertilisers and sulphuric acid.\n\nFor the fly ashes, the quality and reuse potential may vary significantly, depending on the syngas cleaning technology used, the gasification technology and the quality of the original feedstock. In some cases, the fly ash will have a good quality and will not contain sorbents, and these fly ashes may be marketed (example plants: Nuon and ELCOGAS Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants). \n\nIf the gasification process is based on low temperatures (700-800 degC), and the fuel is biomass or some waste fractions, it is possible to produce a fertiliser product from the fly ash and bottom ash. The nutrients from the fuel (especially potassium and phosphorus) can thereby be returned to the fields, and the heating value efficiently used for energy purposes. The process temperature is kept low, to maintain a high availability of the nutrients in the fertiliser, especially phosphorus. Carbon-in-ash has a beneficial effect on agricultural soil, where it contributes to lower leaching of nutrients and an increased water-holding effect of the soil for example. The carbon derived from a low-temperature gasification process is also stable in the soil, while for instance when wheat straw is tilled into the soil, only a few per cent of the carbon remains in the soil, and the rest is released as mainly CO2. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced transfer of pollutants to the environment.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nSee Section 4.2.1.\n\nCross-media effects\nWithout proper separation, the slag may contain an intermediate size fraction with a high ash content, which makes its sale difficult.\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nFilter dust from syngas filtration may contain a mixture of sorbents, unreacted carbon, and all the impurities of the original feedstock, and disposal may be the only option.

The aim is to reduce back to nitrogen the nitrogen oxides that have already been formed. As can be seen from Figure   3 .95, the combustion can be divided into three zones.\n\nFigure 3.95:\tThe three combustion zones and relevant parameters in a reburning process\n\n\nReburning involves combustion occurring in three zones:\n\nPrimary combustion zone (which may be equipped with primary measures): 80-85 % of the fuel is burnt in an oxidising or slightly reducing atmosphere. This primary burnout zone is necessary in order to avoid the transfer of excess oxygen into the reburning zone, which would otherwise support possible NOX formation.\nSecond combustion zone (often called the reburning zone): secondary or reburning fuel is injected into a reducing atmosphere. Hydrocarbon radicals are produced, reacting with the nitrogen oxides already formed in the primary zone; other unwanted volatile nitrogen compounds like ammonia are generated as well.\nThird combustion zone: the combustion is finally completed through the addition of final air into the burnout zone.\n\nDifferent fuels can serve as reburning fuel (pulverised coal, fuel oil, natural gas, etc.), but natural gas is generally used due to its inherent properties. Figure   3 .96 shows the advantage of natural gas over coal or oil. \n\n\nFigure 3.96:\tComparison of coal, oil and natural gas as reburning fuel\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced NOX and CO emissions to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\n\n\nTable 3.34:\tPerformance of the fuel staging (reburning) technique for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions\n\n\nThe efficiency rate of reburning depends on several parameters, including the following:\nTemperature: to obtain low NOX values, the temperature in the reburning zone should be as high as possible (1 200 degC). Figure   3 .97 shows the denitrification rate as a function of the reburning rate at different temperatures.\nResidence time: increasing the residence time in the reburning zone favours NOX reduction. An appropriate time is between 0.4 seconds and 1.5 seconds.\nAeration rate in the reburning zone: the stoichiometry should be in the range  = 0.7-0.9.\nFuel type.\nQuality of the mixing of the additional fuel and the flue-gas generated by the primary combustion zone. Natural gas usually enables homogeneous combustion, resulting in a very short residence time for burnout.\nExcess air in the primary combustion zone: the stoichiometry is approximately  = 1.1.\n\n\nFigure 3.97:\tDenitrification rate as a function of the reburning rate\n\n\nCross-media effects\nWhen using coal or oil as reburning fuel, nitrogen is present in a certain quantity, leading inevitably to NOX formation in the burnout zone. This drawback can be reduced or avoided by using natural gas.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nIn principle, the reburning technique can be implemented in all types of fossil-fuel-fired boilers and in combination with low-NOX combustion techniques (for the primary fuel). In practice, reburning is not commonly used in existing utility boilers firing liquid or gaseous fuels as primary fuels. This abatement technique, while very attractive for new boilers, necessitates large chamber volumes if high amounts of unburnt carbon are to be avoided. Therefore, reburning may be less appropriate for retrofits, due to possible space constraints in existing installations. The retrofit may be less efficient in the case of smaller plants than in larger plants.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, major problems are caused by incomplete combustion. This measure best suits boilers that have a long enough residence time and where proper reburning of fuel is available at a reasonable price. Natural gas has proven to be the best reburning fuel, mostly because it is easily flammable and does not contain particles or sulphur.\n\nCoal over coal reburning requires an ultrafine pulverising system and associated milling plant, cyclones and classifiers to achieve this fineness.\n\nEconomics\nThe costs of reburning depend on the structure of the boiler and on the fuel used. The use of auxiliary fuel, such as natural gas, also incurs costs but, on the other hand, it releases heat to the process and can therefore be considered a usable fuel. So the calculations should be made for the whole power plant economy, including possible changes, e.g. in the boiler efficiency.\n\nExperience shows that reburning is not as cost-effective as low-NOX burners with OFA, but it is still an appropriate measure for reducing NOX emissions. One estimate gives reburning costs as close to EUR 2.5 million for a 250 MWth boiler. The operating costs for reburning have also been calculated as twice as high as the costs for low-NOX burners with OFA.\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOX emissions.\n\nExample plants\nReburning has been installed at large power plants in the US, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and the UK. In Italy, reburning (with oil as a reducing agent) has been implemented successfully in many large oil-fired units.\n\nReference literature\nNo information provided.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3171013_abstract", "x": 0.7508434, "y": 0.36834368, "title": "TUNABLE INTAKE SYSTEM FOR EXHAUST GAS RECIRCULATION IN AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE", "year": 2017, "text": "The invention relates to a tunable intake system (1) for exhaust gas recirculation in an internal combustion engine with a plurality of cylinders, the system comprising:\n- an exhaust gas recirculation manifold (2) arranged to distribute recirculated exhaust gas in an intake air stream to be introduced into the combustion engine;\n- the manifold (2) having an exhaust gas recirculation inlet (3) and an intake air inlet (4) as well as at least one outlet (5) leading to the multiple cylinders of the engine;\n- a first distribution pipe (6) connected to the exhaust gas recirculation inlet (3), said first distribution pipe (6) having a first pattern of flow distribution perforations (7) for distributing the recirculated exhaust gas into the manifold (2), where the invention is especially characterized in:\n- a second distribution pipe (8) with a second pattern of flow distribution perforations (9) for distributing the recirculated exhaust gas into the manifold (2) is fitted outside of said first distribution pipe (6) whereby an interstitial gap (10) is formed therebetween, and\n- at least one of said first and second distribution pipes (6, 8) being rotatable with respect to the other in order to selectively tune the distribution of recirculated exhaust gas for multiple operational points of the engine.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.2.2.3.3\" title=\"Flue-gas recirculation (FGR) or exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)\">\n\n<content>\nFlue-gas recirculation (Flue-gas Recirculation (FGR)) or exhaust gas recirculation (Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR))\n\nDescription\nRecirculation of part of the flue-gas to the combustion chamber to replace part of the fresh combustion air, having the double effect of cooling the flame temperature and limiting the O2 content for nitrogen oxidation, thus limiting the NOX generation.

Therefore, operators usually aim to limit the amount of recirculated flue-gas (to approximately 30 %) and compensate for the higher NOX emissions by using advanced low-NOX burners.\nEconomics\nThe retrofitting of Flue-gas Recirculation (FGR) costs approximately EUR 50 000 for a 20 MWth boiler, and to include it in a new boiler costs approximately EUR 20 000.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOX emissions.\n\nExample plants\nAbout 100 plants that submitted a questionnaire in 2012 for the review of this document are fitted with Flue-gas Recirculation (FGR).\n\nReference literature\nNo information provided.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3785787_abstract", "x": 0.65164435, "y": 0.25322694, "title": "ADSORPTION DEVICE FOR COMPRESSED GAS", "year": 2021, "text": "Adsorption device for compressed gas, whereby this adsorption device (1) is provided with a vessel (2A, 2B, 25) with an inlet (3A, 3B) for the supply of a compressed gas to be treated, and an outlet (4A, 4B) for treated gas and whereby an adsorption element (19A, 19B, 19) is affixed in the aforementioned vessel (2A, 2B, 25), whereby this adsorption element (19A, 19B, 19) extends along the flow direction of the compressed gas to be treated, between the aforementioned inlet (3A, 3B) and the aforementioned outlet (4A, 4B), characterised in that the aforementioned adsorption element (19A, 19B, 19) comprises a monolithic supporting structure that is at least partially provided with a coating that contains an adsorbent.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.2.2\" title=\"Adsorption\">\n\n<content>\nAdsorption\n\nDescription\nThe removal of pollutants from a process off-gas or waste gas stream by retention on a solid surface (activated carbon is typically used as the adsorbent).

It is comparable to the operation of fabric and ceramic filters (see Section 3.5.1.4.7). The distinction is between the filter materials, the catalytic filter being loaded with a catalyst (normally a titanium/vanadium-based catalyst) that destroys pollutants by catalytical gas reaction (e.g. to oxidise dioxins and furans or to reduce NOX when ammonia or urea is injected). The catalyst is also effective at oxidising VOCs where the operating temperature is sufficiently high (> 220 degC) . The separated dust is removed and recycled/reused or disposed of separately.\n\nThe catalyst filter can consist of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, laminated to a catalytic felt substrate. It can also be made using rigid low-density ceramic filter elements (also called candles) incorporating an integral catalyst .\n\nThe catalyst is inserted into the felt substrate. The catalytic filter is installed as a module in a baghouse, shown in Figure   3 .157, in such a way that it can easily be fitted to an existing plant. \n\n\nFigure 3.157:\tCatalytic filter baghouse, including sampling trains\nWhen combined with neutralisation (with the injection, e.g. of sodium bicarbonate or lime, upstream of the catalytic filter) and adsorption systems (downstream of the ceramic and catalytic filters), catalytic filtration can be used to abate acid pollutants (e.g. HCl, SO2, HF) and heavy metals, in addition to dust, NOX and dioxins and furans (see Section 5.2.2).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with catalytic filtration are given in Table   3 .259.\n\n\nTable 3.259:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with catalytic filtration\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe separated dust possibly mixed with acid gas sorbent material is the only residue for which disposal is required. The filtered dust contains up to 90 % fewer dioxins and furans than when activated carbon is used. The dust is normally classified as non-hazardous waste.\n\nThe main utilities and consumables are given in Table   3 .260.\n\n\nTable 3.260:\tConsumables associated with catalytic filtration\n\n\nOperational data\nMonitoring \nPerformance and maintenance should be monitored carefully. The mass emission needed to assess the performance of the filter can be determined by monitoring the particulate concentration in the effluent waste gas stream, using an isokinetic sampling probe or a meter based, for example, on UV/visible opacity, beta rays or particle impingement. Catalyst activity can be monitored by testing an individual filter removed from the baghouse. If there are reasons to suspect a fall in catalytic activity, monitoring of dioxins and furans via stack sampling can be performed.\n\nTemperature and pressure drop across the bag filter need to be routinely monitored. The latter is used to indicate whether it is necessary to begin the cleaning cycle. Bag filters should be inspected regularly to identify any deterioration in the filter housing or filters. Hence access to the filter should be available.\n\nApplicability\nCatalytic filtration is used to separate particulates and eliminate hazardous contaminants from the gaseous phase. The chief contaminants this technique is applied for are dioxins and furans (PCDDs/PCDFs). However, other contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated benzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), VOCs and chlorinated phenols can be eliminated as well.\n\nApplication limits and restrictions are given in Table   3 .261.\n\n\nTable 3.261:\tApplication limits and restrictions associated with catalytic filtration\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages are given in Table   3 .262.\n\n\nTable 3.262:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with catalytic filtration\n\n\nEconomics\nSome cost elements can be found in Section 5.2.2.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nDriving forces for implementation include:\n\nreducing the costs of abatement and increasing depollution efficiency;\nfulfilling environmental legislation.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is reported to be used for waste incineration and the processing of metals.\n\nReference literature\n [ 154, Startin 2008 ]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2980027_abstract", "x": 0.4480272, "y": 0.3624515, "title": "Operating an apparatus for removal of ions with warm and cold water", "year": 2016, "text": "The invention relates to a method of operating an apparatus for removal of ions provided with a capacitor.

MBR consists of the combination of a membrane process (e.g. microfiltration or ultrafiltration) with a suspended growth bioreactor. In an MBR system for biological waste water treatment, the secondary clarifier and the tertiary filtration step of a traditional aerated sludge system is replaced by membrane filtration (the separation of sludge and suspended solids). Typical arrangements consist of vacuum-driven membrane units submerged in the aerated portion of the bioreactor or pressure-driven membrane systems located outside the bioreactor (see also Section 3.3.2.3.5.4). Membranes are typically configured hollow tube fibres or flat panels and have pore sizes ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 microns. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of the use of a membrane bioreactor include:\n\nreduction of the load of suspended solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), BOD, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Phosphorus (TP) by 95-99 %;\nreduction of the microbiological health risk to levels that comply with Directive 2006/7/EC concerning the management of bathing water quality ;\nreduction of the volume of sludge compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment;\nreduction of the plant footprint compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment, especially if tertiary filtration and a UV disinfection unit would be necessary to achieve comparable output quality.\n\nData on the environmental performance of MBRs compared to other biological treatment systems can be found in Section 3.3.2.3.5.4.\n\nCross-media effects\nCross-media effects include energy consumption (mainly for pumping and aeration), chemical consumption (for membrane cleaning) as well as membrane replacement.\n\nOperational data\nAs with other membrane separation processes, membrane fouling is the most serious problem affecting the performance of MBR systems. Fouling leads to a significant increase in hydraulic resistance, manifested as permeate flux decline or transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase when the process is operated under constant TMP or constant flux conditions, respectively.\n\nFrequent membrane cleaning and replacement is therefore required, increasing the operating costs significantly. Membrane fouling results from an interaction between the membrane material and the components of the activated sludge liquor, which include biological flocs formed by a large range of living microorganisms along with soluble and colloidal compounds. Although different membrane manufacturers use different techniques to control fouling, the primary method to address fouling is aeration along with periodic chemical cleaning. Membrane aeration to control fouling was reported to account for 35 % to 40 % of the total power consumption of an MBR .\n\nMBR is key to the central biological waste water treatment in the Roche Diagnostics GmbH chemical plant in Penzberg, Germany. The plant produces biopharmaceutical ingredients using biological processes . The central biological waste water treatment consists of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: high-performance activated sludge treatment of highly polluted waste water from production plants after balancing the concentration (aeration system using refined oxygen).\n\nStep 2: activated sludge treatment of waste water from production plants (after neutralisation) plus effluents from Step 1, plus sanitary waste water after mechanical treatment (screening). Step 2 consists of six aeration tanks operated as a biological cascade; the last tank is designed as a membrane bioreactor.\n\nThe plant has a treatment capacity of 3 800 m3/d and can treat 4 800 kg BOD5/d. The average waste water flow treated in 2007 was 1 366 m3/d.

The Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) started operation in 2004, treating 1.2 million m3 of waste water annually. The Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) achieves more than 99 % BOD removal and approximately 90 % Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal . \nIn France, two Sanofi-Chimie facilities located in Aramon and Sisteron have been using MBR systems (retrofits of conventional activated sludge systems) since the year 2000. The plant in Aramon produces a large range of pharmaceutical products and has two MBRs in parallel, each having a volume of 3 600 m3. The aeration tank is divided into three parts: a high-rate activated sludge zone where Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal and nitrification are carried out, an anoxic zone where denitrification is carried out and a low-rate activated sludge zone where poorly biodegradable Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is removed . \n\nThe plant has a treatment capacity of 1 200 m3/d and can treat up to 15 000 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/d.

When the waste water is subjected to a current, the electrons are exchanged between the electrodes and the liquid. As a result, metal ions present in the waste water deposit on the cathode. The purified waste water then leaves the electrolysis cell and in many cases is reused. The efficiency of the technique can be improved by separating the cathode and the anode sections by the use of a membrane composed of a high charge density polymer. Therefore, the anion or the cation can be made selective by altering the charge of the membrane. As a result, this separation allows the conditions surrounding the electrodes to be individually optimised (e.g. pH correction), thus avoiding after-effects and increasing yields. \n\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nElectrolysis allows for the removal of metal ions from process waters and/or waste waters and allows for the concentration of these metals so that they can be recycled/reused.\n\nCross-media effects\nHigh consumption of energy when low final concentrations are required. Hydrogen gas and chlorine gas may form on the electrodes in the presence of (hydrochloric) acid. Side reactions such as the formation of gases and formation of HCN in cyanide must be prevented by pH correction. \n\nOperational data\nThe ideal pH is determined by each application. Acids can be used to modify the pH in order to avoid the formation of metal hydroxides before metals deposit on the electrodes. Leach solution is used to prevent formation of hydrogen gas from hydrogen ions The retention period in the electrolysis cell is between five and thirty minutes. \n\nThe purification yield is very high and final metal ion concentrations of less than 0.1 mg/l are achievable. However, in order to achieve these levels, reactors with improved mass transfer and/or with high specific surface area should be used. When recuperating Pd and Ni from Pd-Ni alloy baths, the concentration of both metals is reduced to 20 mg/l. The remaining part can be recuperated using other techniques, such as ion exchange. \n\nDuring the disintoxication of cyanides from galvanic baths, residual CN concentrations of less than 1 mg/l can be achieved with initial CN concentrations of 5 g/l. The remaining concentration can be further reduced using ion exchange. \n\nElectrolysis is also used for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) yielding residual Cr(VI) concentrations of less than 0.1 mg/l. In order to achieve high efficiencies (80 % to 90 %), the pH value must be kept less than 3 or 4.\n\nApplicability\nThis method is most appropriate when a single metal pollutant is present in high concentrations in the waste water. The technique is also used for chemical oxidation/reduction and precipitation applications. For each target metal or organic compound that will be recuperated, attention should be given to the possible oxidation/reduction reactions. The type of electrode used is also important. \n\nThe advantage of this technique is that purified water as well as the metals deposited on the electrodes can be reused. In addition to metal removal, organic compounds in the waste water can also be degraded by oxidation and reduction with the exchange of electrons. For metal reuse, only one metal pollutant must be present in the waste water in a sufficiently high concentration as the recuperation of metal and water is difficult in complex mixtures. Also, the quality of the recuperated metal is affected by the inert anodes used as they partially dissolve. To avoid this, graphite anodes are used. \n\nElectrolysis is mainly applied in the metal industry for the purification of rinse waters from pickling tanks or galvanic baths. The applications include recuperation of metals and used electrolytes, disintoxication of nitrite and Cr(VI) and silver recuperation from fixing baths in the graphics sector. This technique is also applicable for the treatment of leachate waters containing heavy metals.\n\nEconomics\nThe cost of an electrolysis installation is to a great extent determined by the type of electrodes that are used. A specific case has been provided to demonstrate this.\n\nIn a small plant for the recuperation of palladium from drag-out rinse tanks, 26 g/h Pd is recuperated. The cost of electricity amounts to EUR 0.75 per kg Pd. Investment costs amount to EUR 93 per anode and EUR 13 per cathode, and eight anodes and seven cathodes are needed for each electrolysis cell. The anode is a Ti/RuO2 electrode and the cathode is a three-dimensional electrode. The investment costs for the cell with electrodes are EUR 3 000 and a rectifier for the voltage amounts to approximately EUR 1 000.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force for implementation is the removal of metals from process waters and/or waste waters.\n\nExample plants\nNo information provided.\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4074865_abstract", "x": 0.6895279, "y": 0.26311892, "title": "WATER ELECTROLYSIS SYSTEM AND WATER ELECTROLYSIS DEVICE", "year": 2022, "text": "A water electrolysis system includes a power generation device, a water electrolysis cell, and a power converter configured to generate an output voltage applied to the water electrolysis cell by converting power supplied from the power generation device, wherein the power converter limits fluctuations in the output voltage to a range equal to or greater than a threshold voltage of the water electrolysis cell such that the output voltage does not become less than the threshold voltage.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.2.3.4.9\" title=\"Electrolysis\">\n\n<content>\nElectrolysis\n\nDescription\nElectrolysis is a process in which an electrical current is applied to a liquid using inert electrodes and an electrical source, resulting in an effective electron transfer in the electrolyte, yielding chemical changes in the composition of the waste water.

It combines permeation and vaporisation. Pervaporation employs both a concentration gradient and pressure as driving forces for separation. Volatile organic compounds are removed from a liquid feed solution through a semi-permeable membrane into the gas phase. The separation of the compounds from a liquid mixture is determined not only by differences in their vapour pressure but also by their permeation rates through the membrane. The driving force for permeation is the chemical potential difference of the compounds between the two phases separated by the membrane.\n\nA vacuum is kept on the permeate side of the membrane while the feed side of the membrane is kept at atmospheric or elevated pressure so a pressure difference is created over the membrane which is the driving force for the pervaporation process. The compound(s) that permeates through the membrane evaporates while passing through the membrane because the partial pressure of the permeating compound(s) is kept lower than the equilibrium vapour pressure. In most cases, the permeate is recondensed.\n\nA schematic of the technique is shown in Figure   3 .94.\nFigure 3.94:\tPervaporation \n\n\nThere are different types of membranes for pervaporation: organic membranes, also called polymeric membranes, and inorganic membranes, also called ceramic membranes. A major drawback of polymeric membranes is their limited solvent and temperature stability. Generally, ceramic membranes are solvent and temperature stable, can be used in a broad pH range and have both high selectivity and permeability. \n\nThe pervaporation process, according to the widely accepted sorption-diffusion model, consists of three consecutive steps:\n\nspecific sorption in the membrane layer of one or more compounds in the feed mixture depending on the characteristics of the membrane;\ndiffusion of the compounds through the membrane;\ndesorption of the compounds on the permeate-side as vapour. \n\nPervaporation is not based on a liquid/vapour balance like distillation, but is based on differences in sorption and diffusion of the various compounds in the feed. Thus, it is an interesting alternative for separating azeotropic mixes, which have the same composition in the vapour and the liquid phase, or mixes with similar boiling points. Furthermore, it offers an energy advantage because only the permeating compound must be converted into the gas phase. \n\nThere is also an alternative process, referred to as vapour permeation. Vapour permeation involves the feed being introduced in vapour form before it comes into contact with the membrane. This alternative is particularly interesting if the feed comes from an earlier process step in vapour form.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn removal of volatile organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons and BTEX) from waste water, pervaporation is competitive with active carbon adsorption and stripping. Pervaporation easily removes compounds from water to levels below 1 %. Higher concentrate purification levels are possible but require a relatively large membrane surface, because the encountered fluxes are relatively low (low driving force) . \n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique has the potential to save energy at a rate above 50 % compared to distillation. If the correct pretreatment is implemented (e.g. microfiltration) in the presence of suspended matter, and if a vapour permeation process is used for the presence of salts, then no problems are expected during membrane cleaning - thus no chemicals are needed.\n\n\n\nOperational data\nIn order to have sufficient flux during pervaporation, work is normally carried out at temperatures between 50 degC and 100 degC. Typical fluxes averaged for a pervaporation process are around 1 kg/(m2xh). Pervaporation is a relatively simple process. The parameters for process optimisation are temperature, vacuum, feed rate and feed concentration.\n\nApplicability\nPervaporation/vapour permeation is a practical and financially viable alternative to distillation when draining solvents, particularly where azeotropes must be degraded or liquids with similar boiling points must be separated. In such cases, a hybrid process (distillation combined with pervaporation) is normally the most economically viable solution.\n\nHydrophilic pervaporation or vapour permeation can also be used to remove water from a reaction mixture and thus favourably alter the reaction balance. This is, for example, used for esterification reactions.\n\nPervaporation should be implemented to remove the minority compound(s) from a mixture. In this case, the required membrane surface and required energy will be at their lowest. Most pervaporation membranes work optimally when the permeating compounds in the feed are below a particular maximum level. Compounds with high boiling points make pervaporation more difficult. They restrict selectivity and can block the membrane. \n\nEconomics\nA theoretical economic evaluation of a hybrid distillation/pervaporation unit for a to-be-processed isopropanol/water mix (50/50 wt%) by Van Hoof et al. (2004) resulted in the following costs both with polymeric and ceramic membranes (lower costs with ceramic membranes):\n\noperating costs (primarily energy): ~ EUR 17/t product;\ninvestment costs: ~ EUR 40/t product;\nmaintenance (including membrane replacement): ~ EUR 13/t product.\n\nThus the costs, for draining solvents that form an azeotrope, using such a hybrid distillation/pervaporation process, are around half of those associated with 'classic' azeotropic distillation. \n\nConsidering the limited implementation, no investment costs can be mentioned for a full-scale installation.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force for implementation compared to more classic technologies such as distillation is the significant energy savings.\n\nExample plants\nThroughout the world, there are various large-scale implementations, with the majority addressing drainage of alcohol (ethanol and isopropanol). The capacity of most installations lies between 50 l/d and 300 l/d. Thus, these are rather small installations.\n\nExamples of sectors where pervaporation can be implemented are the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the petrochemical sector, refineries and paint, gloss, and varnish or printing-ink production.\n\nReference literature\n \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3865606_abstract", "x": 0.42831174, "y": 0.37207177, "title": "WATER ELECTROLYSIS DEVICE", "year": 2021, "text": "A water electrolysis device for generating hydrogen gas includes a case, a power supplying unit, and an ion-exchange membrane electrolyzer.

It also acts as a collector for backwash water.\n\nIon exchangers commonly in use are macroporous granule resins with cationic or anionic functional groups, such as:\n\nstrong acid cation exchangers, neutralising strong bases and converting neutral salts into their corresponding acids;\nweak acid cation exchangers, able to neutralise strong bases and used for dealkalisation;\nstrong base anion exchangers, neutralising strong acids and converting neutral salts into their corresponding bases;\nweak base anion exchangers, neutralising strong acids and used for partial demineralisation.\n\nThe ion exchange operation cycle is comprised of:\n\nthe actual ion exchange operation;\nthe backwash stage, including removal of accumulated particles and reclassification of the ion exchange resin bed;\nthe regeneration stage, using a low volume/high concentration solution, reloading the ion exchange resin with the respective ion, and releasing the unwanted ion species to the regeneration solution;\nthe displacement, or rinse with a slow water flow, of the regeneration solution through the bed;\nthe fast rinse, removing the remaining traces of the regeneration solution, including any residual hardness, from the resin bed.\n\nStorage facilities for the regeneration chemicals are necessary.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nTypical effluent ion concentrations that can be achieved are in the range of 0.1-10 mg/l with influent concentrations of 10-1 000 mg/l.\nAchieved environmental benefits associated with ion exchange are given in Table   3 .89.\n\n\nTable 3.89:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with ion exchange\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe regeneration of ion exchange resins results in a small volume of concentrated acid or salt solution, which contains the removed ions originating from the resin. This enriched liquid has to be treated separately to remove these ions, e.g. heavy metals by precipitation.\n\nThe rinsing water from regeneration contains the same ions as the brine, but in relatively low concentrations. Whether this part can be discharged directly or has to undergo treatment depends on the actual concentrations. At a plant in Germany, the rinsing water from regeneration is reused in waste gas scrubbers.\n\nIon exchange implies the consumption of ion exchange resins, regeneration liquids, water for backwashing and rinsing, and energy for the pumps. The addition of other chemicals, e.g. to suppress microbiological fouling, may be necessary.\n\nSources of noise are the pumps, which can be enclosed.\n\nOperational data\nMonitoring\nInfluent and effluent of the ion exchange vessel have to be carefully monitored for the occurrence of breakthrough.

The difference with a fabric filter is that the filtering material is ceramic. There are also designs where acidic compounds such as HCI, NOX, SOX and dioxins are removed. In such a case, the filtering material is fitted with catalysts and the injection of reagents may be necessary (see Section 3.5.1.5.2).\n\nThe filtering material of a ceramic filter can be applied in many different forms. It is possible to convert the ceramic material into cloth, fibre felt, fibre elements, sinter elements or filter candles. Table   3 .253 below gives an overview of the different applications.\n\n\nTable 3.253:\tOverview of different filtering materials in ceramic filters\n\nFigure 3.156:\tCeramic filter\n\n\nMetal filters\nIn metal filters, surface filtration is carried out by sintered porous metal filter elements. Metal filters can withstand temperatures of up to 1 000 degC and pressure in excess of 69 bar.\n\nSintered metal filter media are typically applied in automatically regenerated filter systems, installed in processes where regular, conventional synthetic (textile) or glass fibre filter media are no longer suitable due to the excessively high operating temperature (> 300 degC). The elements can be easily reverse- (or pulse-) jet cleaned by means of compressed air, nitrogen or clean process gas, depending on the composition.\n\nSintered metal filter media supersede ceramic filter elements when it comes to mechanical strength and resistance against thermal shock. Ceramic filter media are very sensitive to temperature fluctuations.\n\nBesides the high temperature resistance of the porous sintered metal filter elements, there is a wide range of materials available that can be selected for each specific process. The most commonly used materials are SS304, SS316, Inconel, Hastelloy and Fecralloy, dependent on the required chemical resistance.\n\nDue to the high porosity, the differential pressure drop is typically very low (< < 10 mbar). Emission levels below < 1 mg/Nm3 can be achieved.\nSintered metal filter elements are relatively expensive compared to other conventional filter media. However, due to their specific excellent properties, sintered porous metal filter elements are typically applied in heavy-duty, industrial applications, e.g. for emission reduction (mainly catalyst fines) at petrochemical plants as well as for solids removal from bottom products like Fluidised Catalytic Cracking Units and Coker Units. The mechanical and thermal strength of sintered porous metal media makes them very suitable for high-temperature processes, where lifetimes of > 4 years without unplanned stops need to be guaranteed .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with ceramic and metal filters are given in Table   3 .254.\n\n\nTable 3.254:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with ceramic and metal filters\n\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumables associated with ceramic filters are given in Table   3 .255.\n\n\nTable 3.255:\tConsumables associated with ceramic filters\n\n\nThe separated dust - possibly mixed with precoating material - is the only residue. Its quantity depends on the dust content of the incoming gas stream. Depending on its source, the separated dust can be contaminated, e.g. dust originating from incineration might contain dioxins and/or heavy metals and their oxides. This type of dust might be classified as hazardous waste that should be disposed of accordingly.\n\nOperational data\nDesign and maintenance \nThe most important design parameters are the following:\n\nIncoming gas flow.\nWorking temperature and maximum temperature.\nIncoming gas composition.\nFabric filter load (filter ratio). The fabric filter load is dependent on the type and nature of the cloth material, the dust load and the type and size of the particles. Examples are glass fibre: 60-120 m/h; and PTFE (Teflon): 80-100 m/h.\nThe ease of cleaning and the design of the exterior, important for hygiene reasons in the food industry.\n\nCeramic filters require a relatively high level of maintenance and regular inspection in order to prevent the clogging and poor performance of the filtering elements. For these reasons, it may be decided to lower the process temperatures and to install fabric filters instead, for they are easier to maintain.\n\nApplicability\nCeramic filters are mostly applied for dust removal at high temperatures, especially at combustion installations and gasification systems when coal is used as the fuel, in the waste processing industry, the plastics processing industry, the chemical industry and the glass industry. \n\nApplication limits and restrictions are given in Table   3 .256.\n\n\nTable 3.256:\tApplication limits and restrictions associated with ceramic filters\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages are given in Table   3 .257.\n\nTable 3.257:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with ceramic filters \n\n\nEconomics\nThe lifespan of the filtering material is dependent on the design and application .

Costs are primarily driven by the volumetric flow rate and pollutant loading of the waste gas stream. In general, a small unit controlling a low pollutant loading will not be as cost-effective as a large unit controlling a high pollutant loading.\n\nPollutants that require an unusually high level of control or that require the unit itself to be constructed of special materials will increase the costs of the system.\n \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation include legal requirements and raw material savings.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is reported to be widely used in the chemical industry sector as well as in other sectors such as the food, drink and milk industries, the waste processing industry, the metal industry, waste incineration, large combustion plants, ceramics manufacturing and the glass industry.\n\nReference literature\n[ 11, InfoMil 1999 ][ 19, HMIP 1994 ][ 56, US EPA 2003 ][ 57, US EPA 2003 ]    \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3988240_abstract", "x": 0.45222092, "y": 0.43256798, "title": "FLUX-CORED WIRE AND WELDING METHOD", "year": 2022, "text": "A flux-cored wire according to the present invention comprises a flux which is a core and a hoop which is an outer skin, wherein: the flux includes a strong deoxidizing metal element (flux) containing Mg and Al, and a fluorine compound powder (flux); at least 60 mass% of a strong deoxidizing metal powder (flux) related to the strong deoxidizing metal element (flux) has a grain size of at most 150 \u00b5m; at least 60 mass% of the fluorine compound powder (flux) has a grain size of at most 75 \u00b5m; and a flux rate is 10-30 mass%; and a specific composition is satisfied.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.5.4.5\" title=\"Monitoring of diffuse VOC emissions with DIAL and SOF\">\n<referenced_by>3.5.4.4</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nMonitoring of diffuse Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions with DIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) \n\nDescription\nIn order to assess the effectiveness of all the techniques applied to prevent/reduce diffuse Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, two monitoring methods are available for use as described below.\n\n1. Differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) method\nThe DIAL method can target one or two species at a time. It can be used to estimate Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) concentrations in general by targeting a generic wavelength that is representative of the carbon-hydrogen bond within the species of interest. This generic measurement will yield information on C2 to C8 compounds. \n\nDIAL systems have both an infrared and an ultraviolet component. The infrared DIAL is used primarily for alkanes although it can identify most species with absorption in the infrared spectral region between 2.5 um and 4 um - including, for example, hydrogen chloride, nitrous oxide, and methanol. Limits of detection for the alkanes are in the 10-50 ppb range at distances up to about 800 metres. The UV/Visible DIAL can identify and specify benzene, toluene, and xylenes in the 10-20 ppb range and can also be used for measuring elemental mercury, ozone, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen monoxide. \n\nLimits of detection are very dependent upon site conditions at the time of measurement. During a verification project done by the UK National Physical Laboratory, it was reported that the DIAL measurements for a known methane release were within +-10 % of the true values. In other experiments, the DIAL measurements were within +-12 % of the true value of an aliphatic hydrocarbon plume and within +-15 % of a toluene plume . To obtain mass emission fluxes, the concentration data across the plume section are multiplied by the wind velocity perpendicular to the measurement plane. Wind data availability, accuracy and representativeness are essential for reducing measurement uncertainties.

Nonetheless, DIAL studies of 100-plus facilities executed under different climatic, environmental, and operating conditions all show that the facility has higher emissions than are reported .\n\n2. Solar occultation flux (Solar Occultation Flux (SOF)) method\nThe solar occultation flux (Solar Occultation Flux (SOF)) method uses a passive FTIR system mounted in a truck. This method measures olefins and alkanes, but not aromatics. Also, some other restrictions exist on the range of hydrocarbons that can be measured, i.e. those heavier than C8 to C10. Its use is limited to sunny days, and the wind must blow in the same direction for a long period of time. \n\nThe overall uncertainty for quantification in industrial field conditions is evaluated at around 35-40 %. Most of it originates from wind (speed and direction) evaluation uncertainty and retrieval uncertainty (combined effect of instrumentation and retrieval stability on the retrieved total columns during the course of a plume transect).\n\nWhile each approach is different, the DIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) methods both produce roughly equivalent emission estimates. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe facilitation of the prevention and reduction of diffuse Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone.\n\n\nOperational data\nIn Sweden, both DIAL (until 1988, once every three years) and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) (after 1998) methods have been used to make site level assessments at petrochemical installations.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable to all petrochemical sites. \n\nDIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) can be used for the overall quantification of diffuse Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, but they show limitations in the accuracy of the localisation of specific emission sources  .\nThe commercial availability of DIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) is limited in some EU Member States.\n\nEconomics\nDepending upon the size of the site, a typical DIAL survey cost is reported to be between EUR 75 000 and EUR 150 000 (actual cost between USD 100 000 and USD 200 000, average currency conversion rate for 2010: EUR/USD = 1.329). \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation include:\n\nenvironmental legislation;\nreduction in material losses;\nhealth and safety for employees.\n\nExample plants\nPetrochemical installations and refineries in Sweden.\n\nReference literature\n      \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3608011_abstract", "x": 0.63507146, "y": 0.35515606, "title": "SPIRAL-TYPE GAS-SEPARATION MEMBRANE ELEMENT, GAS-SEPARATION MEMBRANE MODULE, AND GAS-SEPARATION DEVICE", "year": 2020, "text": "Provided are a spiral-wound gas separation membrane element, a manufacturing method therefor, a gas separation membrane module and a gas separation apparatus that include the element.

The enriched permeate can be recovered by methods such as condensation (see Section 3.5.1.2.2) or adsorption (see Section 3.5.1.2.3), or it can be abated, e.g. by catalytic oxidation (see Section 3.5.1.3.6).

The process is shown in Figure   3 .135.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.135:\tFlow sheet of the biotrickling process\n\n\nIn a biological trickle-bed reactor, an aqueous phase is continuously circulated through a bed of inert material. This packing can consist of irregular bulk material, such as rings, saddles, etc. or of structured packing. When selecting the packing material, it is necessary in every single case to ensure that, even in the event of an anticipated excess sludge formation, the reactor will not become choked in the long term. The surface properties should be such that the biofilm adheres to it firmly. The pollutants in the waste gas and the oxygen are absorbed by the water phase and transported to the biofilm, where the biological transformation takes place. The quality of the mass transfer from the gas to the liquid phase and the elimination performance of the reactor essentially depend on the wetted surface area of the packing. In order to achieve optimum elimination results, i.e. to maximise the wetted surface area, the liquid phase should be distributed uniformly over the surface of the biofilm .\n\nThe immobilisation of the biomass and the formation of the biofilm are generally a naturally controlled process which starts after inoculation of the water phase. The continuously circulating liquid phase takes on the function of supplying the microbe population with the necessary nutrients. At the same time, excess activated sludge and reaction products which can also be inhibitors, e.g. hydrogen chloride during the degradation of dichloromethane, are washed out of the reactor. In the liquid phase, the essential conditions such as pH, nutrients and salt accumulation need to be controlled .\n\nAs with bioscrubbing, an increase in the salt content of the absorbent takes place. Measures to prevent excessive salt formation include:\n\nadequate removal of the absorbent and simultaneous addition of fresh water;\noperation with softened water;\nvapour saturation of the upstream waste gas.\n\nA biotrickling facility is illustrated in Figure   3 .136.\n\n\nFigure 3.136:\tTypical biotrickling facility \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with biotrickling are given in Table   3 .195.\n\nTable 3.195:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with biotrickling\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe main utilities and consumables are given in Table   3 .196.\n\n\nTable 3.196:\tConsumables associated with biotrickling\n\n\nBecause of biological activities in the biotrickler, the salt concentration in the circulation water increases and thus should be discharged from time to time. This waste water effluent should be treated or disposed of in some other way.\n\nSurplus activated sludge has to be disposed of, depending on the contaminants or degradation products, e.g. by incineration.\n\nOdour might occasionally arise from the tanks storing the circulation water, in such cases collection of exhaust air and its treatment is advised.\n\nOperational data\nDesign and maintenance\nThe handling of the biological film layer (biofilm) of the packing is essential: too much growth can lead to (local) clogging that finally results in preferential streams, causing the size of the exchange surface and thus the performance of the biotrickling filter to worsen. The growth and thickness of the biofilm can be controlled by adjusting the thickness with mechanics (like varying the humidification) or by adjusting the growth of the microorganisms by varying the degree of acidity and/or the salt content. In biotrickling filters that process high H2S concentrations, there is a chance of elementary sulphur forming because of incomplete biological oxidation. This can be recognised by the yellow granular textures and can eventually lead to clogging and preferential currents. Biotrickling filters that process high concentrations of inorganic compounds (e.g. NH3 or H2S) usually have microorganisms that use CO2 from the air as a source of carbon.

The waste gas from the smokeless process phases, which does not require emission abatement, is not treated. The system is regarded as a robust waste gas treatment requiring little maintenance.\n\nThe thermal oxidiser is heated to its operating temperature before the smoke generators are operated. During smoking, the exhaust gas fan force-feeds the smoke-laden waste gas through a waste gas bypass flap to a preheater. Here, the dirty gas is heated to 300-350 degC before it enters the combustion chamber, where it is mixed with the hot gases from the gas burner. After treatment, the clean gas is used to preheat the dirty gas by using an integrated heat exchanger and it is cooled to 400-450 degC before it is discharged to air via a flue stack.\n\nTable   7 .118 shows technical data for direct flame thermal oxidation in the example smokehouse. A flow diagram of the origin and process management of hot gas from this smokehouse is illustrated in Figure   7 .128.\n\n\nTable 7.118:\tTechnical data of a direct flame thermal oxidiser applied in a smokehouse\n\nFigure 7.128:\tFlow diagram showing the origin and process management of the hot gas from the waste gas cleaning system of a smokehouse\n\n\n\nIn the example smokehouse, all smoke units, regardless of their size, are equipped with a smoke generator. The smoking intensity is determined by the smoking time which is approximately 60-120 minutes/batch. The flow rate for one smoke generator is 200 Nm3/h, resulting in a total flow rate for 11 smoke chambers of approximately 2 300 Nm3/h. Applying a realistic parallel operating factor of 75 %, the actual flow rate is 1 650 Nm3/h. Table   7 .119 shows technical data for the direct flame thermal oxidiser used.\n\n\nTable 7.119:\tTechnical data for a direct flame thermal oxidiser applied in a smokehouse\t\n\n\nIt is reported that at 620-660 degC, complete removal of odour emissions is achieved and, as a general rule, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is emitted at an unspecified level below 50 mg/Nm3. Direct flame thermal oxidation can be run at temperatures of up to 1 000 degC. The effectiveness of the technique depends on several parameters such as operating temperature, residence time and mixing conditions in the combustion chamber.

Two variants are used: a) an external recirculation loop between the activated sludge tank and the membrane module; and b) immersion of the membrane module in the aerated activated sludge tank, where the effluent is filtered through a hollow fibre membrane, with the biomass remaining in the tank.\n\nTechnical description\nA MBR is a variation on a conventional activated sludge treatment whereby a number of membrane modules, or cartridges, replace the secondary clarifier and the tertiary filtration step (see Figure   2 .15). Following biological treatment, the mixed liquor is pumped under static head pressure to the membrane unit where the solids and liquids are separated, the clean waste water is discharged, and the concentrated mixed liquor is pumped back to the bioreactor. \n\nThe MBR can be operated in either aerobic or anaerobic mode, thereby increasing the range of suitable chemicals, e.g. used for membrane cleaning in biological treatment. Typical arrangements consist of vacuum-driven membrane units submerged in the aerated part of the bioreactor or pressure-driven membrane systems located outside the bioreactor. Membranes are typically configured hollow tube fibres or flat panels and have pore sizes ranging from 0.1 microns to 0.4 microns.\n\n\nFigure 2.15:\tSimplified process flow diagram of the MBR system\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of the use of a membrane bioreactor include :\n\nreduction of the load of suspended solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC), BOD, and Total Phosphorous (TP) by 95-99 %;\nreduction of the microbiological health risk to levels that comply with Directive 2006/7/EC concerning the management of bathing water quality;\nreduction of the volume of sludge compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment;\nreduction of the plant footprint compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment, especially if tertiary filtration and a UV disinfection unit are necessary to achieve comparable output quality.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nA MBR operates across a range of loading rates, but can achieve a higher treatment rate in a number of ways, i.e. increased static pressure increases the amount of dissolved oxygen thereby aiding mass transfer; using oxygen instead of air; and using a multistage system to optimise the process. For oil and grease applications, concentrations of BOD in the waste water may be reduced to less than 15 mg/l.\n\nA MBR provides highly efficient biomass separation, allowing the biomass concentration within the upstream reactor to be up to 10 times greater than the concentration normally attainable in a conventional suspended growth system. When using a MBR, no secondary sedimentation is required and:\n\nvery broad MLSS levels can be achieved in the bioreactor, i.e. 12-17 000 mg/l;\nvery low Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) emission levels can be achieved after treatment; the dairy installation #409 reported emission levels in the range of 2-4 mg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/l and 4.6-11 mg Total Suspended Solids (TSS)/l as yearly averages .\n\nThe energy consumption, for pumping, might be significantly higher than in conventional activated sludge processes but it can be minimised by applying gravity feed to the waste water. An example dairy in Ireland treats 9 000 m3 of waste water per day to high standards for discharge to a local watercourse, applying gravity feed to make the process low-energy-intensive. The dairy installation #409 reported an energy consumption of 2.6-3.2 kWh/m3 of waste water treated when applying ultrafiltration almost continuously, and reverse osmosis to reuse waste water in the CIP process when needed.\nFouling of the membranes may be a major problem. Aeration and backwashing are used to control this problem, which may result in additional waste water being produced. Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) (see Section 2.3.6.5.4) is used to scour and clean the membrane surfaces to prevent biofouling.\n\nCross-media effects\nCross-media effects include energy consumption (mainly for pumping and aeration) and chemical consumption (for membrane cleaning), as well as membrane replacement.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nA MBR is applicable in all FDM installations. This technique has the advantage of having low space requirements. This system is ideal for higher-pollutant-load, lower-volume waste water. It is especially attractive in situations where a long solids retention time is required to achieve the necessary biological degradation of the pollutants. Furthermore, waste water containing not readily degradable compounds, e.g. phenols, pesticides, herbicides and chlorinated solvents, and high organic pollution can be treated with a MBR. Advantages and disadvantages compared to the conventional activated sludge process are given in Table   2 .60.\nTable 2.60:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with membrane bioreactors \n\n\nEconomics\nHigh energy costs, although the operating costs are comparable to or lower than an alternative aerobic waste water treatment with similar emission levels to those obtained by a MBR.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nPossibility to reuse the water and therefore reduced costs.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique has been reported in several FDM installations belonging to the dairy, fruit and vegetable, and oilseed processing and refining sectors .

The activated sludge mixture is sent to a separation facility from where the sludge is recycled to the aeration tank..\n\nTechnical description\nThe activated sludge technique produces an activated mass of microorganisms capable of stabilising a waste aerobically. The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous matter includes the following items:\n\naeration tank where air (or oxygen or a combination of the two) is injected into the mixed liquor;\nsettling tank (usually referred to as the final clarifier or secondary settling tank) to allow the biological flocs to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.\n\nTreatment of nitrogenous matter involves additional steps where the mixed liquor is left in an anoxic condition (see Section 2.3.6.3.1).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced BOD, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) or Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), phosphorus and nitrogen emission levels. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAfter a given residence time, which can vary from several hours to an excess of 10 days, based on an organic loading rate or F/M ratio of about 0.1-0.15 kg BOD/kg of MLSS per day, the mixed suspension of microorganisms is passed to a sedimentation facility (see Section 2.3.6.5.2) The hydraulic retention time or sludge age and F/M ratio can all vary as a function of the raw waste water characteristics, e.g. composition, availability and degradability of organic substances, and the required final waste water quality. For example, nitrification occurs with lower (< 0.1 kg BOD/kg of MLSS per day) F/M ratios. In the sedimentation facility, the settlement of microbial flocs occurs and clear waste water is passed over a weir to a watercourse. Settled sludge is produced and mostly returned to the aeration tank. However, a proportion, i.e. the excess sludge, is wasted to maintain MLSS at a reasonable level, e.g. 3 000 mg/l .\nThe performance data of an activated sludge WWTP in the brewery sector is shown in Table   2 .56.\n\n\nTable 2.56:\tPerformance data of an activated sludge WWTP reported for the brewing sector\n\n\nPhosphorus removal efficiencies of 20-30 % have been reported using activated sludge .\n\nIn the sugar sector, it has been reported that low winter air and water temperatures depress the treatment capacity as bacterial activity is reduced. However, low-grade waste heat from the sugar process can usually be used to increase temperatures in the system and enhance bacterial activity.\n\nThe most common problem associated with activated sludge is that of bulking. This term is used to describe biological sludge of poor settling characteristics. It is generally due to the presence of filamentous bacteria and/or excessive water bound within biological flocs. Bulking can be prevented by, for example, ensuring that the optimum balance of added nutrients is maintained, minimising both the release of nutrients and the overproduction of filamentous bacteria. In addition, the use of a separate compartment or selector has been recognised as a good tool to prevent and control filamentous growth. This is an initial contact zone where the primary waste water and the returned sludge are combined. \n\nIn the dairy sector, sludge bulking has been reported in activated sludge systems with fluctuating loads and low F/M ratios, e.g. insufficient BOD. If a selector is not used, the final sedimentation needs to be designed according to the inferior sludge settling characteristics.\n\nTo ensure that the activated sludge has enough nutrients, phosphoric acid and/or urea may be added to the influent in the event that the concentration of Total Phosphorous (TP) and/or Total Nitrogen (TN) is too low.\n\nCross-media effects\nThese include high energy consumption for aeration combined with mixing in the aeration tank. Installation #466 reported an energy use of approximately 2.2 kWh/kg of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) . Volatile waste water content can be released into the atmosphere, giving rise to odour. Aerobic biological treatment produces a relatively large amount of excess activated sludge that needs to be disposed of.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nWidely used in the FDM sector. The technique can be used to treat high- or low-BOD waste water, but will treat low-BOD water highly efficiently and cost-effectively. \n\nEconomics\nThe activated sludge technique provides a cost-effective treatment of soluble organic matter.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCompliance with legal requirements to limit pollution to a receiving water body.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique is widely used in FDM installations .\nReference literature\n, , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3342291_abstract", "x": 0.724527, "y": 0.34193033, "title": "SMOKING DEVICE", "year": 2018, "text": "Smoking device (10) includes smoking chamber (14), smoke generating chamber (16), smoking heater (28), communication path (30), and fan (32).

Organic vapours have a considerately higher permeation rate than oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen or carbon dioxide (10 to 100 times higher). The waste gas stream is compressed and passed over the membrane. The enriched permeate can be recovered by methods such as condensation (see Section 4.4.2.2.2) or adsorption (see Section 4.4.2.2.3), or it can be abated, e.g. by catalytic oxidation (see Section 4.4.2.2.8). The process is most appropriate to higher vapour concentrations.

The liquid gases are stored in gastight vessels for further treatment according to Regulation 1005/2009/EC. The inert gas is recovered and reused.\n\nFigure   3 .67 below gives an example of degasification and waste gas treatment by cryogenic condensation.\n\nFigure 3.67:\tDegasification of Step 2 - Cryogenic condensation \n\n\nA general description of the cryogenic condensation abatement technique can be found in the CWW BREF \n\nAdsorption technique (see also Section 2.3.4.9): the gases are pumped into adsorption filters. An adsorption process generally consists of at least two filters which are switched in parallel so that at least one is adsorbing and one is regenerating. The used activated carbon is regenerated by means of heated air pumped into the filter to evaporate trapped VFCs and VHCs. After the filter, the regeneration waste gas is compressed and cooled in order to liquefy the VFCs and VHCs (in some cases by cryogenic condensation). The liquefied gases are then stored in gastight vessels. The remaining waste gas is usually led back into the adsorbing filter in order to minimise VFC or VHC emissions. Adsorption filters are also sometimes used after cryogenic units in order to improve their efficiency. Figure   3 .68 below gives an example of degasification and waste gas treatment with activated carbon adsorption.\n\nFigure 3.68:\tDegasification of Step 2- Activated carbon adsorption\n\nA general description of activated carbon adsorption can be found in the CWW BREF .\n\nCatalytic conversion technique: the gas is sent to two catalytic converters connected in series. The hydrocarbon compounds (e.g. isobutane, pentane) are thermally oxidised in the first converter to form water and carbon dioxide (CO2). In the second reactor, VFCs are converted into hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) and CO2. HCl and Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) gases are either absorbed in water to produce dilute acid, or neutralised, for example with liquid alkaline solutions (sodium hydroxide) or solid sodium bicarbonate. As the process in the first reactor is exothermic, it simultaneously acts as a preheater for the second catalytic converter stage. Similarly, the thermal energy in the gases emitted from the second reactor is used to preheat the untreated gases before they enter the first reactor.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of these techniques include:\nreduction of diffuse and channelled VFC/VHC emissions;\nreduction of diffuse and channelled Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\n\nCryogenic technique: The shredding chamber is encapsulated under suction, VFCs/VHCs are exhausted and N2 is blown in to reduce the O2 level to < 4 %. For a shredding chamber measuring 2000 mm x 1200 mm x 1000 mm, the total amount of air exhausted would be 400 m3/hour. The VFCs/VHCs are then exhausted inside the unit, which cools them down with liquid nitrogen to -90 degC. At that freezing temperature the gases turn into liquids. The liquefied gases are then stored in tanks. The tank is placed on a scale, which makes it possible to see how much gas is recovered and when the tank has to be changed.\n\nThe specific consumption of N2 reported via the data collection is around 0.06 t/tonne of waste treated. \n\nSee also Section 3.2.2.1.2 for CFCs, HFCs and HCFCs emissions to air, and Section 3.2.2.1.3 for organic compounds emissions to air.\n\nAdsorption technique: The gases from the shredding area are pumped into adsorption filters. Cooling can be used prior to adsorption to reduce the amount of water in the process gas. VFCs and VHCs are captured by activated carbon in the adsorption filters. An adsorption process always consists of at least two filters which are switched in parallel so that at least one is adsorbing and one is regenerating. During the filter regeneration, heated outside air is pumped into the filter to evaporate trapped VFCs and VHCs. After the filter, the gas is compressed and cooled in order to liquefy the VFCs and VHCs (in some cases by cryogenic condensation).

See also Section 17.8.5.4.\n\nTechnical description\nUV curing can be used for the printing and coating in the metal packaging industry. Its main application is for the outside of cans as there are restrictions concerning food contact. It is a low-temperature and solvent-free process. Low-molecular-weight resins/monomers, with a low viscosity, start a rapid chemical reaction/cross-linking. This reaction is initiated by the formation of reactive cleavage products of the so-called photoinitiators. This cleavage process is started if the photoinitiator is in contact with UV light of a specific frequency. Different types of coating demand different photoinitiators. The UV light is generated by the use of doped mercury lamps, with the types used depending on the end use and the corresponding photoinitiator. The end use is mainly flat sheets with the exception of UV coating for the rim of a beverage can's base. Although the process is solvent-free, extraction is still necessary due to the formation of ozone and a need to avoid possible odour problems caused by the used monomers. The cleavage products of the photoinitiator are by theory bound to the backbone of the formed polymer.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nUV curing uses solvent-free lacquers / printing inks (see Section 17.7.2.3). In combination with a lower amount of energy compared to the thermoset lacquers which need a long thermal oven, CO2 emission is also avoided.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nUV curing systems are often combined with the roller coaters that are normally used in metal packaging manufacturing. However, combinations of UV application and conventional gas ovens can also be found. UV curing systems also require less space. UV varnishes and UV printing inks have a limited adhesion towards metal and can therefore not be used for some applications.\n\nCross-media effects\nOff-gases from the application and curing of UV coatings will still need extraction for health and safety reasons due to ozone formation.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant for applicability\nUV curing is currently limited to the outside of cans due to restrictions relating to food contact legislation. Also, direct application on electrolytic tinplate is more difficult due to limited adhesion. New UV resin technologies, like cationic curing, have less restriction concerning smell and will have more possible end uses than the old technologies. New types of UV light sources are developed like UV-LED, with less energy consumption, longer lifetimes and a better curing control. However, the tighter frequency range of LEDs requires lacquer modifications when changing from mercury lamps to LEDs.

Water acts as the carrier for the biocides.\n\nTechnical description \nWater-based low-pressure processes mainly substitute solvent-based preservative systems while water-based high-pressure processes are suitable to substitute creosote-using ones. Water-based treatments can be used instead of creosote for some end uses up to a 30-year life expectancy (and longer with the case-by-case approval of the preservative manufacturer). Examples are medium-life fencing, cladding of agricultural buildings, some horticultural uses .\n\nWater-based preservatives can also be used in open impregnation systems, e.g. in dipping installations .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nNo use of creosote or solvents. \nEmissions of solvents (i.e. VOCs) are avoided.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nSwitching from solvent-based preservatives to water-based systems can achieve a VOC reduction approaching 100 %, or, for water-based microemulsion systems, a reduction of 99 % .\n\nConsumption and emission levels for wood and wood products preservation using water-based treatment chemicals are detailed in Section 15.3.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to plants using solvent-based preservatives or creosote. \nIn some cases the quality requirements of the wood/wood product may not be achievable with water-based preservatives, e.g. due to the swelling of the wood, which must be avoided when treating certain finished products.\nIn addition, timber treatments with higher levels of copper (ACQ and CuAz) are more corrosive .\n\nEconomics\nThe process of impregnation of solvent-based and water-based preservatives is very similar with no significant economic differences.\n\nIn a typical new installation, wood is treated in an 18 m3 treatment vessel with a charge capacity of 14 m3 of wood. The impregnation cycle takes 4 hours and can therefore be repeated six times a day due to 24-hour shift work. With 250 working days, a yearly production of about 20 000 m3 can be achieved. Depending on the intended application, the raw material costs are between EUR 10/m3 and EUR 30/m3, energy costs are negligible and water costs are EUR 0.5-1.5/m3.

Water-based adhesives do not contain organic solvents or contain about 0.5 % solvent as a softener to keep the glued joint flexible. \n\nTechnical description\nWater-based polymers alone are not sufficient to impart optimum adhesion to the adhesive, and tackifier resins are necessary to improve adhesion to different materials. In many cases, the same elastomers and tackifiers can be used as those used in solvent-based systems.\n\nThe amounts of solids in both adhesives (solvent-based and water-based) are about the same.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSolvent emissions are eliminated.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWater-based adhesives' raw materials are available in dry and wet form. Adhesive in dry form has about 65 % less volume and 75 % less weight than solvent-based adhesive - consequently transport costs are relatively low. The disadvantage of transporting it in dry form is that it has to be formulated on site - which requires large water-resistant mixing tanks with non-corrosive piping, fittings and stainless steel mixers and pumps. This increases the capital cost of operation. Ready mixed water-based adhesives have roughly the same volume and weight as solvent-based adhesives and transport costs are similar. They suffer from mould growth and should be stored above freezing point (multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided) .\n\nCross-media effects\nMore energy is required for drying.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique is applicable in new and existing plants and installations. Water-based adhesives are not as widely applicable as solvent-based adhesives due to their lower performance; for instance, they have a more restricted operational temperature range .\n\nWater-based adhesives are suitable for the lower quality range of packaging and masking tapes as well as for double-sided tapes.\n\nFor the production of plastic films used for temporary surface protection, water-based adhesives with low solvent content are used .\n\nEconomics\nCompared to solvent-based adhesives, the most important difference is their lower price - approximately 15-20 % of that of conventional products.\n\nInvestment costs for water-based adhesive applications are estimated to be ~ 8 % lower than for conventional solvent-based systems. The higher costs for solvent-based systems result from the need for explosion-proof electrical equipment and emission control systems and waste disposal charges .\n\nThe operating costs for both water-based and solvent-based systems are about the same - apart from the lower energy costs due to abatement technologies not being necessary for water-based systems.\n\nExample plants\nPlant #156 (used as dispersions for specific types of products) in .\n\nReference literature\n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3061776_abstract", "x": 0.46360123, "y": 0.3155736, "title": "Aqueous peptide-functionalized polyurethane dispersions", "year": 2016, "text": "The present invention relates to aqueous peptide-functionalized polyurethane dispersions that can be used as adhesives, in particular for metal surfaces, such as steel surfaces.

Water-based adhesives do not contain organic solvents or contain about 0.5 % solvent as a softener to keep the glued joint flexible. \n\nTechnical description\nWater-based polymers alone are not sufficient to impart optimum adhesion to the adhesive, and tackifier resins are necessary to improve adhesion to different materials. In many cases, the same elastomers and tackifiers can be used as those used in solvent-based systems.\n\nThe amounts of solids in both adhesives (solvent-based and water-based) are about the same.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSolvent emissions are eliminated.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWater-based adhesives' raw materials are available in dry and wet form. Adhesive in dry form has about 65 % less volume and 75 % less weight than solvent-based adhesive - consequently transport costs are relatively low. The disadvantage of transporting it in dry form is that it has to be formulated on site - which requires large water-resistant mixing tanks with non-corrosive piping, fittings and stainless steel mixers and pumps. This increases the capital cost of operation. Ready mixed water-based adhesives have roughly the same volume and weight as solvent-based adhesives and transport costs are similar. They suffer from mould growth and should be stored above freezing point (multiple freeze-thaw cycles should be avoided) .\n\nCross-media effects\nMore energy is required for drying.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique is applicable in new and existing plants and installations. Water-based adhesives are not as widely applicable as solvent-based adhesives due to their lower performance; for instance, they have a more restricted operational temperature range .\n\nWater-based adhesives are suitable for the lower quality range of packaging and masking tapes as well as for double-sided tapes.\n\nFor the production of plastic films used for temporary surface protection, water-based adhesives with low solvent content are used .\n\nEconomics\nCompared to solvent-based adhesives, the most important difference is their lower price - approximately 15-20 % of that of conventional products.\n\nInvestment costs for water-based adhesive applications are estimated to be ~ 8 % lower than for conventional solvent-based systems. The higher costs for solvent-based systems result from the need for explosion-proof electrical equipment and emission control systems and waste disposal charges .\n\nThe operating costs for both water-based and solvent-based systems are about the same - apart from the lower energy costs due to abatement technologies not being necessary for water-based systems.\n\nExample plants\nPlant #156 (used as dispersions for specific types of products) in .\n\nReference literature\n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3403735_abstract", "x": 0.71225417, "y": 0.28741485, "title": "A REMEDIATION METHOD AND SYSTEM", "year": 2018, "text": "A remediation system, comprising: a heating chamber (20) having an inlet for a contaminated medium to be purified, an outlet for a purified medium and an outlet for exhaust gas emitted while heating the medium; a source of hot air (60) for heating the medium inside the heating chamber (20); microwave generators (21) for heating the medium in the heating chamber; a catalytic combustion unit (30) for catalytic combustion of the exhaust gas emitted from the heating chamber (20) to outlet a purified gas; a heat exchanger (40) for generating a stream of heated air by heating air with a heat from the purified gas; wherein the stream of the heated air from the heat exchanger (40) is introduced to the heating chamber (20).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"9.4.3.1\" title=\"Process-integrated VOC catalytic oxidation\">\n<referenced_by>9.4.1</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nProcess-integrated VOC catalytic oxidation\n\nDescription\nThe air/solvent mix resulting from solvent evaporation during the repeated enamel curing process is treated in a catalytic oxidiser integrated in the curing oven/dryer. The waste heat from the catalytic oxidiser is used in the drying process to heat up the circulating airflow and/or as process heat for other purposes within the plant.\n\nTechnical description\nThis drying and curing process happens inside the enamelling chamber, which consists of a heated chamber (horizontally or vertically arranged) where the solvent is evaporated before moving into a higher temperature zone (> 400-700 degC) where the film is cured. \n\nRecirculating airflow ovens are in use for contemporary wire coating processes. The direction of the circulating airflow can be with or against the direction of the moving wire. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIntregrating drying and curing with off-gas extraction and oxidation achieves:\nreduction of VOC emissions; and \noptimal energy recovery from the waste solvent. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNo specific measurement is available for the ratio between the energy input from external heating (gas or electricity) and from solvent-laden air. Plants' estimations show that of 40 % of the total heat/energy used comes from the catalytic oxidation of the evaporated solvents.\n\nIn gas-heated machines, the solvent-laden air is passed directly into a gas burner, where the design of the burner allows adequate mixing with secondary (recirculated) air and oxidation occurs. To ensure that the solvent concentration does not exceed the lower explosive limit (Lower Explosive Limit (LEL)), it is important that excess air is supplied. \n\nUsing electrical heating, the solvent-laden air is passed over heating elements to reach a temperature of more than 500 degC. This is generally sufficient to support the catalytic oxidation. In all cases, electrically heated machines use precious metal catalysts. After thermal or catalytic oxidation of the solvents, the air stream is recirculated to provide complete or partial heating of the enamelling chamber. Exhaust gas velocities may be lower than in other industries to ensure a maximum energy efficiency balance from the use of recirculated air. It is important that any oxidation takes place where the air stream is recirculated. Oxidation in the stack will only produce hotter exhaust air.\n\nContemporary ovens in use for very fine enamelled wires work with heat transfer by radiation or a combined radiation and circulating airflow/convection.\n\nThe enamelling chamber is typically maintained under sub-atmospheric (negative) pressure to allow the capture of any fugitive emissions from the enamel supply system and to prevent any degradation products or products of combustion from entering the workplace air.\n\nCross-media effects\nMaintaining high VOC destruction rates is vital to guarantee conformity with VOC emission legislation as well as keeping the finished wire free of solvent residues. This main aim might conflict with the target to maintain low CO and NOX emissions.\n\nInput of nitrogen-containing enamels and the high temperatures at the catalysts could give rise to non-optimised CO and NOX emissions.\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable in the winding wire plants.\n\nContemporary ovens in use for very fine enamelled wires work with radiation or a combined radiation and circulating airflow.\n\nEconomics\nA rough estimation of the purchase cost for a complete line gives a range from EUR 120 000 to EUR 250 000, and the average might be EUR 200 000 per line (data from 2017).

The system is structured as follows:\nair distribution duct;\nfilter plenum.\n\nFrom the air distribution duct, the supply air passes through perforated plates into the filter plenum, which is separated from the cabin zone by the filter cover. The ceiling filters present in the filter cover are primarily used for uniform air distribution in this zone. In addition, the air is once again 'finely filtered' through the filter mats before entering the cabin, in order to prevent the penetration of dust and fibre particles into the airway.\n\nSpray cabin\nThe spray cabin consists of self-supporting frame elements with planking. The inner side walls are equipped with windows to the control areas and are even to avoid deposition of paint on landings and in dead zones. Access from the control areas arranged on the long side is possible via doors with safety interlocks. The control areas can only be entered via airlocks.\nThe car bodies are mounted on transport skids and are automatically transported to the various painting stations. They are dedusted using different techniques before entering the painting zones. In a painting booth, 10 to 20 vehicles are machined simultaneously.\n\nAfter completion of the coating process, the car bodies are transferred into a dryer.\n\nVentilation system\nThe conditioning of the air to the required parameters is achieved using ventilators with heaters (direct or indirect heating), coolers, humidifiers, filters and fans. The air is supplied to the cabin via a plenum chamber over the whole cabin area. The exhaust air is withdrawn from the cabin via fans. The cabins are operated with a low vacuum to prevent leakage of solvents. The paint overspray deposition can be carried out with different systems. During wet washout, the humidity increases to over 90 %. Therefore, use of circulating air is only possible with high energy expenditure for dehumidification.\n\nIn the case of the dry deposition of the lacquer dispersion, recirculating air operation is useful since the parameters of the air, in particular the humidity, are not significantly changed.\n\nHeat recovery is possible and efficient in wet washing through heat wheels. In the case of dry deposition with recirculating air guidance, the solvents are concentrated. These are often treated in a thermal off-gas treatment system with heat recovery.\n\nVarious variants of air routing and energy recovery are shown in Figure   2 .45 and Figure   2 .46.\n\nFigure 2.45:\tStructure and air conduction of a spray booth \n\n\nFigure 2.46:\tDifferent variants of air routing and energy recovery\n\n\nPaint boxes \nIn contrast to large pass-through cabins with simultaneous coating of many bodies in different painting stations, in a paint box a single body is coated.

Paint overspray is collected in dust filters. For drying, either Infrared Radiation (IR) radiators are used, hot circulating air is introduced into the painting booth or the body is transferred into an adjacent single body dryer oven. \n\nDip tanks\nThe pretreatment and electrocoating zones are also equipped with housings.

However, the recirculation rate is limited by the fresh air demand of the control zone, by manual workstations, or by the need to not exceed 25 % of the lower explosive limit.

Water-soluble, liquid, fixating wood preservatives are used on the basis of copper complex compounds and a quaternary ammonium compound.\n\nThe impregnation installation and the impregnating process needed to be adapted to the applied preservatives (e.g. structural measures, reduced vessel filling level due to formation of foam, respecting the process parameters).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe chemicals used have less direct impact in the event of emissions. Less hazardous waste is produced with regards to the life cycle of the products.\n\nExample plant: DE-3 in \nThe chrome-free copper-containing preservative is not mobile, i.e. it has no creep properties, even in the wood. Chromium-free preservatives are, in contrast to chromium-containing products, immobile in the soil. Chromium-containing wood preservatives can cause environmental pollution of the groundwater and related contaminated site, due to the mobile properties of chromium(VI).\n\nThe chrome-free wood preservatives are self-fixing and the fixing process (binding on the wood fibre) is relatively fast: after 12 hours ~ 97 %; after 48 hours ~ 99 %.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\n\nExample plant: DE-3 in \nDue to the properties of chrome-free preservatives, the system parameters have to be more accurately followed, as it was before the substitution (this requires additional controlling measures such as a viscometer, electrical measurement, switching from the acidic (pH 3-4) to alkaline medium (pH 10.2-10.4)).\n\nIn the container containing wood preservative, the salt components can sink to the bottom of the tank, resulting in partial segregation. After longer non-operating times (e.g. during the weekends), the container contents need to be stirred before use in order to mix the wood preservative components .\n\nIn Plant DE-3 which uses chromium-free wood preservatives, a vacuum must be gradually applied to reduce the foaming of the alkaline medium. Later on, a stronger vacuum is required to reach the required depth of impregnation (as the chromium-free preservatives have no creep properties, the stronger vacuum is required to reach the heartwood area by creeping, for example the remaining 5 mm).\n\nExperience from Plant DE-3 has shown that the filling level of the impregnating boiler must be reduced due to the increased formation of foam resulting from the application of chromium-free wood preservatives (approximately 0.5 m less filling). In addition, it has to be checked that there are no dry spots on the top edges of the impregnation boiler (due to the lower filling level, the wood preservative does not reaches the wood) and that the wood is completely impregnated. The filling level of the impregnation boiler has to be precisely set in advance of the impregnation process and the impregnation boiler capacity can be exploited to a slightly lesser degree (reduced production capacity, see sketch below).\n\n\nFigure 15.180:\t\tReduction of filling level (example plant DE-3)\n\nCross-media effects\nThere is a lower degree of capacity utilisation in the installation through reduced filling level of the impregnating boiler. In the case of formation of dry areas, the wood must be repeatedly treated.\n\nAfter service life, the impregnated wood products can be incinerated for energy use in an appropriate combustion plant. Chrome-free wood preservative induces chromium-free incineration ash .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nFor the vacuum-pressure impregnation, there are generally no restrictions for the application of chromium-free preservatives. The following aspects, inter alia, have to be respected:\nincreased, relatively strong foaming;\naccurate adjustment of the process parameters and necessity for additional control measures/instruments;\nlower filling level and thus lower production capacity;\napplication of vacuum must be used at a different location, if necessary;\ncorrosion or incrustations may occur.\n\nThe constraints cannot be excluded by application of other impregnation processes, e.g. the alternating pressure process there is also significant formation of foam. In this case, a precise selection of the adequate impregnating agent and impregnation process is required (for example, in collaboration with the wood preservative manufacturer) .\n\nFor poles, for instance, it is applicable only according to the sector's standard requirements and at the customer's request.

This technique refers to high-solids solvent-based paint applied as base coat and topcoat.\n\nTechnical description\nWith modern solvent-based very-high-solids paints, the same VOC to solids ratio as with water-based paints can be achieved. High-solids solvent-based paints typically have double the solids content of medium-solids (Medium-solids (MS)) solvent-based or standard water-based (Water-based (WB)) paints (High-solids (HS) base coat: 35-45 % solids, Medium-solids (MS) Solvent-based (SB) or standard Water-based (WB): 18-22 % solids) . The solids in the paint make up the final paint layer, hence one litre of high-solids paint can replace two litres of standard paint. High-solids solvent-based paints typically contain 20-35 % less VOCs than conventional solvent-based paints (High-solids (HS) 55-65 % VOCs vs Medium-solids (MS) 78-82 % VOCs), which means that for each litre of paint used less VOCs are released compared to a medium-solids paint.\n\nFor more information on the various types of high-solids coatings, e.g. medium-solids (Medium-solids (MS)), high-solids (High-solids (HS)) ultra-high-solids (Ultra-high-solids (UHS)) and their use in vehicle coating, see Section 2.2.3.8 and Table   2 .5.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe use of high-solids paints reduces solvent use compared with conventional, solvent-based paints, while still applying the requisite amount of coating.\nReduction of solvent consumption and emissions.\nLess energy consumption compared to water-based paints.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWith the utilisation of high-solids solvent-based paints, the same coating effect as with conventional solvent-based paints can be achieved but with less paint volume and therefore less VOC release. Water-based paints usually also have a lower solids concentration, so the difference in VOC load emissions is less than the difference in VOC concentration between the two paint types, as more Water-based (WB) paint needs to be applied to achieve the same coating.\n\nStainless steel equipment in paint supply equipment and application is not required unlike in the case of Water-based (WB) paints.\n\nSolvent-based systems achieve high-quality outputs in a wider range of climatic operational conditions compared to water-based paint systems. Therefore, less energy is needed to heat or cool the booth air, and to adjust the humidity. This is especially important in countries with extremely high or low temperatures.\n\nSolvent-based materials do not require a forced flash-off before the oven. This saves space and therefore air volume to be conditioned plus the energy required for the forced flash-off. In a solvent-based paint shop, the flash-off between base coat and clear coat takes only 90 seconds. In a water-based paint shop, the flash-off takes 10 minutes and the vehicle needs to be brought from ambient temperatures to about 60-80 degC and then cooled again to ambient temperature. In the enamel zone, 36 % more air needs to be moved in a Water-based (WB) paint shop. As a result, the direct energy requirements for each vehicle body are lower for solvent-based systems.\nThe higher VOC concentration in the oven exhaust air and booth exhaust air of solvent-based systems has a beneficial effect on the energy consumption of the abatement system. The VOCs support the combustion in the oxidiser, and depending on the concentration may sustain combustion ('fumes to fuel'). The heat is usually recovered and used for heating the dryers.\n\nCross-media effects\nSolvent-based paints are more likely to require off-gas treatment system compared to water-based paints. However, water-based paints still contain VOC solvents and the clear coat is usually solvent-based, so water-based systems will also require energy-intensive abatement.\n\nVOC abatement is usually done with oxidisers which generate secondary emissions of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSolvent-based paints can be used in all phases of the painting operation (primer, base coat, clear coat and repair), and can be used on metals and plastics. They can be applied in new and existing paint shops where space is limited and where changes in the paint materials may not be technically possible.\n\nEconomics\nConversion to high-solids solvent-based paints can be achieved without loss of production in existing sites, as it can usually fit into the same plant footprint. Investment costs for a solvent-based plant are significantly lower compared to water-based systems. The plant footprint is smaller, air conditioning can be sized to allow for a wider range of climatic conditions, mild steel can be used and the vehicle throughput is high.\n\nHigh-solids solvent-based paints are cheaper than water-based paints on a per solids basis; however, this is strongly dependent on the market conditions.\n\nThe solvent-based technology can also be applied globally due to its reliability, which is an important factor for international companies. Commonality of processes and materials is an important factor to achieve economies of scale and reduced product development testing.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nAutomotive manufacturers in the EU operate on sites that have been established sometimes up to 100 years ago. There are numerous space constraints, inside and outside the paint shop. Approximately 35 % of all passenger car paint shops and 65 % of commercial vehicle paint shops (vans, trucks, truck cabins and buses) in the EU currently use solvent-based primer and/or base coat. High-solids solvent-based paints can be retrofitted into an operational plant, where modifications can only be made during the short 2- to 3-week shutdown period in summer or winter.\n\nExample plants\nFord, Europe, see Section 2.2.\n\nReference literature\n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3312110_abstract", "x": 0.5819659, "y": 0.47451386, "title": "APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CLEANING AND RECOVERING PAINT  IN PAINTING MACHINES", "year": 2018, "text": "System (3, 3', 4) for recovering paint and cleaning in a painting machine (1) provided with a conveying band (11) for conveying panels (12) to be painted, comprising:\n- A unit (3, 3') for paint recovery, in its turn comprising a reverse roller (5, 5') in contact with said conveying band, recovering paint (12) sprayed on said conveying band (11) itself, and a doctor blade (6, 6') which in its turn scrapes said reverse roller (5, 5') allowing to recover paint for its successive channelling to a tank (19),\n- A cleaning unit (4) in its turn comprising a cleaning roller (8), a drying blade (9), an idle roller (17').characterized in that it comprises at least one paint recovery unit (3) in the form of an independent unit and at least an independent cleaning unit (4) for said conveying band in the form of an independent unit.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"2.4.5.2\" title=\"Recovery of used solvents\">\n<references_to>17.12.3</references_to>\n\n<content>\nRecovery of used solvents\n\nDescription\nSee Section 17.12.3.

There are also options with or without an abrasive.\n\nTechnical description\nThere are several techniques categorised according to the water pressure used: low-pressure water cleaning (< 340 bar), high-pressure water cleaning (340-700 bar), high-pressure water jetting (> 700 bar), ultra-high-pressure water jetting (> 2 000 bar). By varying the water pressure, single layers of coat or the entire coat system can be removed. (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is a dustless surface treatment method using extremely high-pressure water and no abrasive. There are also methods that combine the use of water with an abrasive.\n\nOne advantage of (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is that water penetrates deep into the metal pores, allowing an efficient removal of chlorides, much more so than in dry blasting. Also, poorly adhering coating is efficiently removed in (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting since water forces its way through and under the coating, breaking the bond and shearing it off.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n(U)High-pressure (HP) blasting has several environmental advantages. In most cases, no abrasives are used and dust formed of paint residues is bound in water, which minimises dust emissions and waste generation. Only paint waste needs to be collected and disposed of safely. The amount of waste material to be disposed of is kept low. \n\nGenerally, noise is comparable to traditional dry blasting methods, whereas in advanced models noise is efficiently reduced by vacuum or use of a box around the spear head.\n\n\nFigure 4.59:\tBox around the spear head in some more advanced robot models\n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\n(U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is generally considered a fast method compared to traditional dry blasting. Treatment efficiency for (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting can be 20-30 m2/h up to 350 m2/h depending on the model. Estimates vary a lot and depend on various site-specific factors and thus can only be considered indicative.\n\nIn advanced (U)High-pressure (HP) models, the work is carried out remotely. The nozzle is attached to the work surface by vacuum, which at the same time sucks off the removed waste material and waste water. The waste water is treated before discharge or it can be filtered and reused and the sludge can be collected in bags.\n\nThe nozzle can furthermore be encapsulated in a box, which further reduces the noise. Use of a robot also minimises the health and safety risks of blasting. This is also an important issue since conditions can be extreme outdoors and in confined spaces such as inside tanks. Shipyard employees are at an increased risk of exposure to toxic dusts, high noise levels, and a range of other health and safety hazards. Also, if (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is used manually, specific safety clothing is needed because of the extremely high pressure.\n\nEmissions are very much case-specific.\n\nSpecific water consumption is small, typically less than 0.06 m3/m2 of treated surface.

(U)High-pressure (HP) water blasting is not applicable in cold climatic conditions, below -5 degC. Furthermore, (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting does not create the same rough surface as dry blasting methods, which is necessary for the adequate adherence of some coating systems. Therefore, the technology is generally not applicable for new surfaces. The applicability of (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting together with a specific coating needs to be verified with the paint supplier and usually it must also be approved by the client.\n\nCurrent (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting equipment nozzles are not small enough to allow proper execution of 'spot blasting' and to be carried with handheld devices [PT comment #32 in ]. The robotic versions currently on the market, on the other hand, are not versatile enough to be applicable for the sometimes small vessels and limited surface areas to be blasted .\n\nEconomics\nThe disadvantage of (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is higher investment and maintenance costs compared to traditional methods (investment costs and maintenance costs are double or more than those of traditional methods).

Use of a robot also minimises the health and safety risks of blasting. This is also an important issue since conditions can be extreme outdoors and in confined spaces such as inside tanks. Shipyard employees are at an increased risk of exposure to toxic dusts, high noise levels, and a range of other health and safety hazards. Also, if (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is used manually, specific safety clothing is needed because of the extremely high pressure.\n\nEmissions are very much case-specific.\n\nSpecific water consumption is small, typically less than 0.06 m3/m2 of treated surface. When using a robot, the waste water may also be collected directly in tanks. In some models, water can be collected, filtered and reused, which also means easy separation of waste for controlled disposal.\n\nCross-media effects\nPaint waste which may contain removed antifouling or lead or chromium pigments from older coatings requires collection and managed disposal.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant for applicability\n(U)High-pressure (HP) blasting may not be applicable in cold climatic conditions, or due to surface specifications (e.g. new surfaces, spot blasting).\n\nUHP blasting and other wet blasting methods are replacing traditional dry blasting techniques as technical tools for UHP water jetting are becoming more economical and adapted to the multitude of applications needed (e.g. ship-shaped areas, spot blasting, existent paint edge feathering).\n\nThe efficiency of UHP blasting varies case by case, as demonstrated by a comprehensive study carried out by a Finnish shipyard to compare UHP and traditional blasting methods which has ended up using UHP blasting (see (Peled 2013) in ).\n\n(U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is not suitable for all services and conditions. (U)High-pressure (HP) water blasting is not applicable in cold climatic conditions, below -5 degC. Furthermore, (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting does not create the same rough surface as dry blasting methods, which is necessary for the adequate adherence of some coating systems. Therefore, the technology is generally not applicable for new surfaces. The applicability of (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting together with a specific coating needs to be verified with the paint supplier and usually it must also be approved by the client.\n\nCurrent (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting equipment nozzles are not small enough to allow proper execution of 'spot blasting' and to be carried with handheld devices [PT comment #32 in ]. The robotic versions currently on the market, on the other hand, are not versatile enough to be applicable for the sometimes small vessels and limited surface areas to be blasted .\n\nEconomics\nThe disadvantage of (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting is higher investment and maintenance costs compared to traditional methods (investment costs and maintenance costs are double or more than those of traditional methods). Many case-dependent factors affect the overall costs, labour time, waste management costs, etc. In particular, waste management costs can be significantly higher in dry blasting than in (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting. The amount of waste material to be disposed of is very low compared to conventional techniques. The consumption of blasting media and the generation of waste with other blasting techniques is higher than when using (U)High-pressure (HP) blasting. Waste management costs can vary from tens of euros per tonne up to hundreds of euros per tonne depending on whether the waste can be recovered as material or needs to be disposed of as hazardous waste . When using water as a blasting medium, other costs should be considered: primary treatment of the water to be used for blasting (conductivity and chloride content requirements), containment and waste water treatment for reuse of waste water, costs with fresh water supply and waste water treatment [SEA SMRC comment #61 in ].\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegislation controlling dust emissions in the environment and health and safety in the workplace.\n\nExample plants\nWidely used.

The oven is then run in such a way that air is used with the minimum required flow to keep it at acceptable levels for avoiding the risk of explosion. The solvent concentration in the extracted air is then as high as possible as long as it is safe.\n\nThe European Standard EN 1539:2015 defines the admissible operating ranges with respect to the admissible drying temperature and the maximum admissible concentration of released flammable substances.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMost solvents are released during the curing/drying stages of production. Having an efficient extraction of the air from the oven and an efficient treatment later is the best way of significantly lowering overall emissions.\n\nIn the case of coil coating, the extraction and subsequent oxidation of solvent fumes from the oven results in very low values of emitted VOCs.\n\nThe use of Flame Ionisation Detection (FID) for optimising the airflow in the oven makes it possible to lower the overall energy needed in the drying/curing step including VOC abatement.\n\nThe fugitive solvent emissions are reduced to the maximum possible extent by using an efficient extraction system.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe quality control of the pre-painted product ensures that all solvents are released out of the paint and all solvents from the paints are then vaporised in the oven. An efficient air extraction system makes it possible to capture most of these solvents to send them to the oxidiser. A small amount of solvents can exit the oven with the strip (boundary air layer close to the strip), so other techniques are often used at the same time to prevent or capture this small flow.\n\nThe VOC content in the ovens of an example plant is in the range of 8.75-9.3 g/m3, which is around 22 % of the Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) (40 g/m3). The flow of fumes is continuously measured and the concentration of VOCs in the oven/dryer can also be measured. This is increasingly common for a number of reasons (e.g. safety, lower energy consumption, lower environmental impact).\n\nCross-media effects\nExtraction requires energy, primarily electrical energy for the operation of the extraction fan.\nNoise levels might increase.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nWorkplace health and safety.\n\nExample plants\nWidely applied and reported by all plants participating in the data collection.\n\nReference literature\n     \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3300915_abstract", "x": 0.4553852, "y": 0.283775, "title": "INKJET PRINTING METHODS FOR DECORATIVE SURFACES", "year": 2018, "text": "An inkjet printing method for decorative surfaces including the steps of jetting an image on a first thermoplastic foil (12) with one or more pigmented free radical UV curable inkjet inks on the first thermoplastic foil (12);\nat least partially UV curing the jetted image on the first thermoplastic foil (12); inserting a layer containing a vinylchloride-vinylacetate-vinylalcohol copolymer between a second thermoplastic foil (12) and the first thermoplastic foil carrying the at least partially UV cured image (15) with the at least partially UV cured image (15) facing the layer containing a vinylchloride-vinylacetate-vinylalcohol copolymer; wherein at least one of the first and second thermoplastic foils is a transparent thermoplastic foil; and wherein the one or more pigmented free radical UV curable inkjet inks contain a polymerizable composition having: 30 to 90 wt% of one or more compounds with one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group; 10 to 70 wt% of one or more compounds with two ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable groups; and\n0 to 10 wt% of one or more compounds with three or more ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable groups, wherein all weight percentages wt% are based upon the total weight of the polymerizable composition.

UV-cured inks have much stronger pigments than other inks. The amount of ink to be transferred must be much smaller. Where in 'normal' flexography the substrate is forcefully locked between the image carrier and the impression cylinder, in UV printing this must be far less. Only very little pressure is used. This is one of the main reasons why retrofit is not possible on most existing flexography presses. In flexography, in the case of web breakages, the end of the broken web may, on its way to the end of the press, pass a few inkpans and transport ink from one inkpan to the next. This must, of course, be cleaned before printing can restart. In 'normal' flexography this is cumbersome, but in UV flexography this is nearly impossible because of the heavy pigmentation and the fact that the ink does not dry. When printing with UV flexography, the press design must be such that in case of web breakages, the web is immediately stopped, before the end of the web can drag through any inkpan.\n\nA major problem is presented by the difficulty in cleaning presses where UV-cured inks are used. The strong pigmentation and the fact that UV inks do not dry anywhere other than on the substrate means that the smallest amount of contamination makes for serious quality problems. Cleaning is very labour-intensive because the inks do not easily dissolve in any solvent. The problem is larger where colours need to be changed between jobs, which is the case with printing packaging materials.\n\nIn a Dutch plant, cleaning between jobs was prohibitively time-consuming and caused unacceptable quality problems. In order to limit cleaning, a patented system was developed that reduces the number of colour changes drastically. Seven standard colours are used to build up the required colours. This means that seven out of eight printing units do not need to be cleaned between jobs. The eighth printing unit is used to add an additional colour if still necessary. For every job that is switched from 'normal' flexography to UV flexography, all image carriers need to be replaced. In publications, colour photographs are built up from four standard colours. This system, however, cannot produce every colour and brightness necessary in packaging printing.\n\nUV-cured inks were originally introduced for the printing of labels and show a continuous rising use. UV-cured inks are used for flexographic printing on paper, cartons and self-adhesive paper labels, especially when a high-quality result is required .\n\nUse of UV-radiation-cured inks in flexographic printing was reported for three plants in the frame of the data collection .\n\nCross-media effects\nIn some circumstances, the energy consumption of the UV curing lamps may exceed the usual dryer consumption, although one plant reports overall energy savings. The UV lamps contain mercury and require special management as a waste.\n\nUV-cured inks contain reactive acrylates, monomers and oligomers, some of which are allergenic.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUV-cured inks can be applied in flexographic processes for printing paper packaging materials, labels, and carton packaging materials for dairy products. However, manufacturers of packaging materials for food are often reluctant to employ UV-cured inks since the migration of minute quantities of some of the ingredients of these inks into the packed food may lead to non-compliance with food contact legislation. One solution to this problem can be overlacquering of the print in order to protect ingredients (like residual monomers, etc.) from migrating.\n\nMost paper can be printed with UV inks. The limitation is, however, not the substrate but the existing machinery. UV-curing flexography is used for several applications (e.g. self-adhesive labels, beverage cartons). In both cases, presses are used that are built specifically for the purpose: labels on small narrow web presses (up to 25 cm) and beverage cartons on presses with a width of between 100 cm and 150 cm.\n\nNot all solvent-based inks can be substituted by UV-cured alternatives due to the need for specific application properties.\n\nEconomics\nIn the case of flexography for beverage cartons, the machines are considerably more expensive than 'normal' flexographic presses. Better quality can however be obtained, which is needed in answer to market demands.\n\nWhere otherwise increased quality requirements tend to lead to a switch from flexography to rotogravure, the combination of the run length, customer requirements for regular changes in the printed image and the special substrates used for these cartons make UV-curing flexography an appropriate technique in this case.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nWorkplace health and safety.\n\nExample plants\nThomas Grafishe Veredelung GmbH & Co, KG, Germany.

Better quality can however be obtained, which is needed in answer to market demands.\n\nWhere otherwise increased quality requirements tend to lead to a switch from flexography to rotogravure, the combination of the run length, customer requirements for regular changes in the printed image and the special substrates used for these cartons make UV-curing flexography an appropriate technique in this case.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nWorkplace health and safety.\n\nExample plants\nThomas Grafishe Veredelung GmbH & Co, KG, Germany.

In some cases of raw material with a high moisture content, three stage cyclone plants are used. Under optimised circumstances such a configuration will use 2 900 - 3 300 MJ/tonne clinker. \n\nThermal energy optimisation techniques can be implemented at different units of the plant including:\n\ncooler:\ninstallation of a modern clinker cooler, e.g. stationary preliminary grate\nuse of cooler grate plates offering a greater flow resistance, to provide a more uniform cooling air distribution\ncontrolled cooling air supply to the individual grate sections\n\nkiln: \nhigh capacity utilisation\noptimised length:diameter ratio\noptimised kiln design with regards to the fuel type which is inserted\noptimised kiln firing systems\nuniform and stable operating conditions\noptimisation of process controls\ntertiary air duct\nnear-stoichiometric, but oxidising kiln conditions\nuse of mineralisers\nreducing air-in leakage\n\ncalciner:\nlow pressure drop\nuniform distribution of the hot meal in the kiln riser\nminimal coating formation due to low circulation of alkalis\nextensive precalcination of the raw meal\n\npreheater:\nlow pressure drop and a high degree of heat recuperation in the cyclones\nhigh cyclone collection rate\nuniform meal distribution over the gas duct cross-sections\nuniform distribution of solid and gas streams in a two-string preheater\ncyclone stages (three to six cyclones in total)\n\nmaterial handling: \nlow moisture content of raw materials and fuels\neasily combustible fuels with a high calorific value\nhomogenising and even feeding (precise metering) of kiln feed material\nhomogenising and even feeding of fuels\n\nmills:\ncompound operation of mills.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of thermal energy consumption.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe use of a gas/air exchanger or a quench system for long kilns as well as a gas bypass in preheater/precalciner kilns increases fuel energy. \nFor the use of flame cooling, additional heat could be required to evaporate the water, which decreases the energy efficiency.\n\nLower numbers of cyclones induces higher thermal losses with the flue-gas leaving the preheater. \n\nOperational data\nUnder the optimised conditions of a short-term performance test (e.g. 36 hours performance test) the thermal energy use is 2 900 - 3 300 MJ/tonne clinker. Due to events deviating from the regular operating conditions (e.g. start-ups and shutdowns) the yearly average values are about 160 - 320 MJ/tonnes clinker higher.\n\nIn cases when plants are suitable and designed especially for the use of certain types of waste fuels, thermal energy consumption can still be in the range of between 3 120 - 3 400 MJ/t clinker. Properties of the waste fuels used, e.g. calorific value, reactivity, coarseness, influence the energy efficiency (see Sections 1.2.4.3 and 1.3.3.3) [92, Austria, 2006], [162, A TEC, 2006], [171, A TEC, 2007].\n\nValues are calculated and valid for a kiln system with a capacity of 3 000 t/d. Also production capacity has an influence on the energy demand. Burning clinker in kilns with a higher capacity of, e.g. 5 000 t/d, saves about 100 MJ/tonne clinker, while the energy consumption of smaller kilns, e.g. producing 1 500 t/d, is up to 200 MJ/tonne clinker higher. These effects are mainly due to different wall heat losses per tonne of clinker produced. An evaluation of a kiln's energy consumption needs to take these effects into account [84, CEMBUREAU, 2006].\n\nThe more cyclone preheater stages there are, the higher the energy efficiency of the kiln process will be. The lowest energy consumption can be achieved with five or six cyclones (see Section 1.3.3.1 and Table   1 .17). However, the number of cyclone stages is mainly determined by the moisture content of the raw material (see also Section 1.4.2.1.2).\n\nApplicability \nThe appropriate number of cyclone stages is determined by the throughput and the moisture content of raw materials and fuels which have to be dried by the remaining exhaust gas heat since local raw material situations vary widely regarding moisture content or burnability [76, Germany, 2006].\n\nSeveral impacts can affect the energy consumption of up-to-date plants with precalciners and cyclone preheaters, e.g.:\n\nraw material properties, such as moisture content or burnability (see Sections 1.2.2, 1.2.4.2 and 1.4.2.1.2)\nthe use of fuels with varying properties (see Sections 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.4.2.1.3)\nthe use of a gas bypass system (see Sections 1.2.5.4.1 and 1.4.2.1.4)\ntarget clinker quality\nkiln size and capacity.\n\nEconomics\nEnergy use (thermal and electrical) typically accounts for 30 - 40 % of the production costs. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegal requirements.\nLocal conditions.\nEnergy costs, as well as emissions trading lead a way towards energy efficiency. \n\n\n\n\nExample plants and reference literature\nCement plants in the EU-27.\n[9, CEMBUREAU, 1997 November], [60, VDI 2094 Germany, 2003], [76, Germany, 2006], [81, Castle Cement UK, 2006], [84, CEMBUREAU, 2006], [86, EURITS, 2006], [92, Austria, 2006], [136, European Commission, 1993], [153, Castle Cement UK, 2007], [154, CEMEX UK, 2006], [162, A TEC, 2006], [168, Technical Working Group (TWG) CLM, 2007], [171, A TEC, 2007], [181, European Commission, 2008].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4230908_abstract", "x": 0.76282305, "y": 0.36263478, "title": "ULTRA-LOW NOX MULTI-PORT AIR STAGED BURNER APPARATUS", "year": 2023, "text": "A burner apparatus and a method of operating the burner apparatus can include a housing and an array maintained by the housing.

The primary air proportion is reduced to some 6 - 10 % of that required for stoichiometric combustion (typically 10 - 15 % in traditional burners). Axial air is injected at high momentum in the outer channel. The coal may be blown through the centre pipe or the middle channel. A third channel is used for swirl air, its swirl being induced by vanes at, or behind, the outlet of the firing pipe.\n\nThe net effect of this burner design is to produce very early ignition, especially of the volatile compounds in the fuel, in an oxygen-deficient atmosphere, and this will tend to reduce the formation of NOx. \n\nCross-media effects\nNo issues.\n\nOperational data\nNOx reductions of up to 35 % are achievable in successful installations and emission levels of around 500 - 1 000 mg/Nm3 (daily average value) have been reported.\n\nApplicability\nLow NOx burners can be applied to all rotary kilns, in the main kiln as well as in the precalciner. However, the application of low NOx burners is not always followed by a reduction of NOx emissions.\n\nThe set-up of the burner has to be optimised. If the initial burner runs on a low percentage of primary air, a low NOx burner will have a marginal effect.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment cost for a new low NOx burner is about EUR 150 000 to 450 000 for a kiln capacity of 3 000 tonne clinker/day. However, by replacing a burner by a low NOx burner, investment costs can rise up to EUR 600 000 and additional work is required for modifying fine coal storage and metering. If the existing firing system uses direct firing, it should be changed to an indirect firing system to allow combustion with a low primary airflow; this will mean an additional investment cost of about EUR 600 000 to 800 000 for a kiln capacity of 3 000 tonne clinker/day.\n\nSee also Table   1 .34 and  Table   1 .40 (Section 1.4.8.2) where example costs are shown.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegal requirements.\nLocal conditions. \n\nExample plants and reference literature\nCement plants in the EU-27.\n[9, CEMBUREAU, 1997 November], [12, Netherlands, 1997], [20, Rother, 1996 January,] [76, Germany, 2006], [85, CEMBUREAU, 2006], [101, France/ADEME/MEDD, 2002], [168, Technical Working Group (TWG) CLM, 2007], [182, Technical Working Group (TWG) CLM, 2008].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}]
