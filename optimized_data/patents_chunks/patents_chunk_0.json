Physical scrubbing is when the component is dissolved in the solvent, whereas chemical scrubbing is when the component reacts with a chemical present in the solvent. Physical scrubbing can be used for both material recovery and abatement, whereas chemical scrubbing is normally only used for abatement. In physico-chemical scrubbing, the chemical reaction is reversible so that the gaseous component can be recovered.\n\nTechnical description\nA full description of the wet scrubbing process and the types of wet scrubbing equipment available is given in the CWW BREF. The abatement efficiency of wet scrubbers is dependent on the residence time of the gas in the absorption section, the type of scrubber used, e.g. the column internals (random packing, structured packing, etc.), the scrubbing liquid used and the liquid to gas ratio. If the scrubbing liquid is recirculated, the refreshment rate of the liquid and the addition rate of any chemicals can also be important.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRecovery of chemicals for use/reuse.\nReduced emissions to air.\n\nThe first stage in the recovery of HCl is usually wet gas scrubbing. The HCl is recovered from the scrubber liquor and purified so that it can be used as a raw material or product (e.g. in the TDI/MDI process (see Chapter 10) and the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) process (see Chapter 11)).\n\nWet scrubbers can often be installed close to individual emission sources.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe treated waste gas from scrubbers will be fully saturated with water vapour.\nWhere the resulting scrubber liquor is treated to recover the absorbed component, or stripped to remove VOCs, the recovery process may generate emissions to air that may also need to be abated.\n\nData for emissions of HCl and chlorine after wet scrubbing have been reported for the processes used to produce:\nTDI/MDI (see Section 10.4.1);\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\nAdditional performance information can be found in the CWW BREF.\n\nCross-media effects\nScrubbing generates a process water stream, which will require further treatment or disposal. Effluent volumes can be minimised through recirculation, but this can reduce the effectiveness of scrubbing. A pumped recirculation and forced bleed will be necessary to prevent the accumulation of salts or other contaminants in the recirculating scrubber liquor.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nWet scrubbing is widely used in the LVOC sector.\nThis technique is applicable for the treatment of gaseous streams containing high concentrations of suitable VOCs.\nThe use of absorption is subject to the availability of a suitable solvent, with a high solubility for the gas, low vapour pressure and low viscosity.\nWet scrubbers are typically used to remove water-soluble organic compounds, e.g. alcohols, hydrogen halides or ammonia, with the main aim being the recovery and reuse of these components.\nAlkaline scrubbers are typically used to remove acid gases, such as hydrogen halides, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide.\n\nEconomics\nWet scrubbers are relatively low-cost and there is the potential benefit of product recovery.

In physico-chemical scrubbing, the chemical reaction is reversible so that the gaseous component can be recovered.\n\nTechnical description\nA full description of the wet scrubbing process and the types of wet scrubbing equipment available is given in the CWW BREF. The abatement efficiency of wet scrubbers is dependent on the residence time of the gas in the absorption section, the type of scrubber used, e.g. the column internals (random packing, structured packing, etc.), the scrubbing liquid used and the liquid to gas ratio. If the scrubbing liquid is recirculated, the refreshment rate of the liquid and the addition rate of any chemicals can also be important.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRecovery of chemicals for use/reuse.\nReduced emissions to air.\n\nThe first stage in the recovery of HCl is usually wet gas scrubbing. The HCl is recovered from the scrubber liquor and purified so that it can be used as a raw material or product (e.g. in the TDI/MDI process (see Chapter 10) and the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) process (see Chapter 11)).\n\nWet scrubbers can often be installed close to individual emission sources.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe treated waste gas from scrubbers will be fully saturated with water vapour.\nWhere the resulting scrubber liquor is treated to recover the absorbed component, or stripped to remove VOCs, the recovery process may generate emissions to air that may also need to be abated.\n\nData for emissions of HCl and chlorine after wet scrubbing have been reported for the processes used to produce:\nTDI/MDI (see Section 10.4.1);\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\nAdditional performance information can be found in the CWW BREF.\n\nCross-media effects\nScrubbing generates a process water stream, which will require further treatment or disposal. Effluent volumes can be minimised through recirculation, but this can reduce the effectiveness of scrubbing. A pumped recirculation and forced bleed will be necessary to prevent the accumulation of salts or other contaminants in the recirculating scrubber liquor.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nWet scrubbing is widely used in the LVOC sector.\nThis technique is applicable for the treatment of gaseous streams containing high concentrations of suitable VOCs.\nThe use of absorption is subject to the availability of a suitable solvent, with a high solubility for the gas, low vapour pressure and low viscosity.\nWet scrubbers are typically used to remove water-soluble organic compounds, e.g. alcohols, hydrogen halides or ammonia, with the main aim being the recovery and reuse of these components.\nAlkaline scrubbers are typically used to remove acid gases, such as hydrogen halides, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide.\n\nEconomics\nWet scrubbers are relatively low-cost and there is the potential benefit of product recovery. Further information is provided in the CWW BREF.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nRaw material recovery from waste gas streams, e.g. hydrogen halides and water-soluble VOCs.\nAbatement of inorganic pollutants.\n\nExample plants\nWet scrubbers are used to reduce emissions to air, e.g. in the following LVOC processes:\n\nThe phosgenation of toluene diamine (TDA) to toluene diisocyanate (TDI). This  produces HCl, which is recovered by wet scrubbing using water.\nThe combined waste gas streams from EDC and/or Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) production are treated by using a thermal oxidiser or a liquid/waste gas incinerator followed by two-stage wet scrubbing. The first stage uses water in an HCl absorber and the second stage uses a caustic scrubber.\nWet scrubbing with water is used to recover ammonia in the production of ethanolamines.\n\nReference literature\nFor further information on this technique, please refer to the CWW BREF.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2876137_abstract", "x": 0.4601445, "y": 0.27004305, "title": "BINDER COMPOSITIONS OF ALIPHATIC OR CYCLOALIPHATIC DICARBOXALDEHYDES AND RESORCINOL", "year": 2015, "text": "The present invention provides substantially formaldehyde free aqueous thermosetting binder resins from resorcinol and cycloaliphatic dialdehydes, glutaraldehyde or their mixtures and urea which may be excluded or included up to amounts which deter hot wet tensile strength in the cured binder.

Furthermore, the chemical-physical process of the present invention makes use of very short treatment times and does not need heat sources with impacting CO2 emissions; the process itself does not emit CO2, it totally recycles the water and leads to a structurally simple and economical treatment and transformation plant. This process has the advantage of not emitting odors and of using natural, renewable reagents, allowed in organic farming, with a neutral carbon footprint and which are easily manageable in terms of safety for health and the environment. The chemical-physical process aims to obtain two end products free of pathogenic microorganisms, free of phytotoxicity and free from vectors and/or viable seeds derived from solid organic waste and/or treated solid biomass, and these products are: an organic chelate of potassium fertilizer and a biodegradable self-supporting material, both innovative for their composition, structure and use. The use of the two aforementioned products in the agronomic field makes it possible to implement an agronomic technique that protects the soil and restores its fertility at each crop succession; this use allows to vary or not, according to the different agronomic needs, the pH value of the circulating solution, the C/N ratio of the soil, to maximize the nitrogen fixing process of the bacteria naturally present in the soil with dedicated crops in succession and in the at the same time increase the strength of the soil (soil depth). The chemical-physical process with zero CO2emissions for the treatment and transformation of solid organic waste and/or solid biomass, and the agronomic use of the fertilizing organic potassium chelate and the biodegradable self-supporting material, are functionally connected in a system of capture and storage of CO2 in the soil with significant technical, economic and environmental efficiencies. The transformation of solid organic waste and/or solid biomass into the aforementioned innovative products refers to the complete composition of solid organic waste and/or solid biomass and therefore not to parts, extracts or compounds isolated from them. The use of biodegradable self-supporting material in the pre-sown version in the agronomic field allows to maximize agricultural productions also with organic farming methods, bringing them on a par with the most recent soilless cultivation techniques, but with the advantage of being significantly cheaper, manageable and even more sustainable from an environmental point of view.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"11.4.3.6\" title=\"Recovery of chlorinated organic by-products\">\n\n<content>\nRecovery of chlorinated organic by-products\n\nDescription\nIsolation and purification of chlorinated compounds for further use.  \n\nTechnical description\nIn some plants, major by-products such as chloroethane and 1,1,2-trichloroethane are recovered and reused (or marketed for use) as feedstock for other chlorinated hydrocarbon processes.

In addition, operating costs of the metallurgical process are substantially reduced by regenerating and recycling the reducing agent, iron, and the flux, sodium carbonate.Nowadays, the extraction of metals from mining activity is carried out by conventional and modern processes. On the one hand, we find conventional pyrometallurgical processes, which involve the previous toasting of the mineral before extracting metals in furnaces, and on the other hand, combined pyro, hydro and electrometallurgical processes, in which sulphurated minerals are toasted first, and the dissolved metal to be extracted is then leached and electro-deposited. These processes are highly polluting, though. With respect to modern processes, we find biometallurgy, which uses bacteria for the extraction of metal, with the disadvantage of being slow processes. On the other hand, hydrometallurgy is also used at high pressure, which involves high investment and operating costs.The new metallurgical process consists of:\n- Extraction of metals in the smelting furnace using iron as a reducing agent and sodium carbonate as a flux\n- Selective dissolution in water of sodium sulphide from slag and filtering of waste, ferrous oxide\n- Regeneration of sodium carbonate for recycling\n- Removal of hydrogen sulphide gas and obtaining elemental sulphur\n- Sintering of ferrous oxide agglomerates for subsequent reduction of iron metal\n- Generation of reducing gases, carbon monoxide and hydrogen\n- Regeneration of metal iron for recycling from ferrous oxideThe proposed technological innovation combines novel pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, different from conventional ones, which do not require a prior toasting of the sulphurated mineral concentrate, and are technically and economically more advantageous than the currently used processes because it reduces to zero the positive oxidation state of the metal directly, using a single reactor for the extraction of metal. It regenerates and recycles metallurgical inputs with complementary processes, with a high speed in the kinetics of chemical reactions and, all this, without generating slag or polluting gases. As a result, the extraction of metals is achieved at a low operating cost, in an environmentally sustainable manner, thus avoiding high costs for environmental remediation.It is important to point out that the proposed invention can also be applied to the treatment of tailings and environmental liabilities, solving a problem that has been accumulating for years due to mining activity that is not very environmentally responsible and which, until now, has not been possible to remedy due to the high costs involved.Consequently, by applying this process, the economic viability of mining projects is increased, even under a scenario of lower metal prices. The process involved allows mining companies to obtain lower cut-offs and cash costs for their extractive activity and, in turn, allows them to generate higher revenues from the export of metals, rather than the export of mineral concentrates. In addition, as it is a clean and environmentally friendly technology, it allows mine closure costs to be radically reduced. As a result, this process provides a higher level of profitability and sustainability of mining activity.On the other hand, with a gradual implementation of the proposed process in mining activity, the Government will benefit thanks to the increase in the Trade Balance, resulting from increased exports, and to the higher tax revenue that will be generated by higher business income. This, in turn, positively affects regional and local governments for the higher revenues that will be generated from mining royalties. Increased mining activity will imply greater sources of direct and indirect employment generation, as well as boosting other sectors of the economy, such as the steel, metalworking and construction industries. Added to this are the lower costs of remediation of environmental liabilities. In short, it has the potential to generate higher incomes for the Government, and thus greater socio-economic well-being for the population.The advantages of this technological innovation in the environmental field range from the regeneration and recycling of inputs, and the elimination of slag and polluting gases from the extractive process, to the remediation of tailings from current mining activity as well as existing environmental liabilities, resulting in less pollution of rivers, agricultural fields and less impact on natural reserves. In other words, it significantly reduces the environmental footprint of mining activity.Finally, and as a consequence of the aforementioned, this invention manages to improve health standards in the population adjacent to the mines by reducing emissions and toxic waste, as well as by eliminating risks derived from the potential rupture of dams in tailings. Similarly, mining activity, by ceasing to interfere with the population's agricultural, fishing and livestock activities, reduces the possible emergence of social conflicts, thus allowing the viability of mining projects to increase, which in turn translates into greater social works and an increase in the income of the surrounding population. In conclusion, this innovative process for the extraction of metals has the capacity to generate harmony between mining activity, the environment and the population.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"11.4.3.6\" title=\"Recovery of chlorinated organic by-products\">\n\n<content>\nRecovery of chlorinated organic by-products\n\nDescription\nIsolation and purification of chlorinated compounds for further use.  \n\nTechnical description\nIn some plants, major by-products such as chloroethane and 1,1,2-trichloroethane are recovered and reused (or marketed for use) as feedstock for other chlorinated hydrocarbon processes.

Instead of using a dedicated thermal oxidiser, the thermal oxidation can also be carried out in a liquid waste incineration plant (see Section 11.4.3.5). \n\nTo reduce emissions of PCDD/F, rapid quenching and, if necessary, injection of activated carbon is applied.\n\nAll waste gas streams that contain organic compounds are treated with a combined treatment consisting of a thermal oxidiser or a liquid/waste gas incinerator, an HCl absorber and a caustic scrubber, possibly combined with a pre-scrubber and/or a final activated carbon adsorber, in order to minimise emissions of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), organochlorine pollutants including PCDD/F, HCl and Cl2. And combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO.        \n\nTechnical description\nAll waste gas streams from the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) installations that contain organic compounds are combined (following measures to reduce the load as described in Section 11.4.1.1.2). This includes:\n\nthe process vents from direct chlorination and oxychlorination;\nthe overhead vents and possibly light ends from product purification and recovery (washing, distillation);\nvents from the waste water pretreatment;\nwaste gas from the incineration of liquid residues when it is sent to the combined treatment as a second line of abatement;\nvents from low-pressure storage tanks, depending on the tank location.\n\nThe combined waste gas generally contains HCl, several chlorinated hydrocarbons (mainly        EDC, carbon tetrachloride, CHCl3, dichloromethane, C2HCl3, C2H2, Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM), C2HCl3O, vinyl acetylene, chloroethane) and unreacted ethylene. Depending on the HCl concentration, the first step of the combined treatment is a wet pre-scrubber to reduce the HCl content before incineration/oxidation, in order to recover HCl and reduce the potential for PCDD/F formation. The following incineration/oxidation is performed in such a way as to almost completely destroy the chlorinated hydrocarbons from the waste gas and, for gas/liquid incineration, the liquids (including contaminants like PCDD/F) and to avoid de novo formation of PCDD/F (optimised design including turbulent burners, sufficient minimum residence time and temperature, rapid quenching). The combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO. For further details, see Section 2.4.3.5.6 for thermal oxidisers and the Waste Incineration (WI) BREF for incinerators.\n\nFollowing the oxidation/incineration, the waste gas is scrubbed in two steps to remove HCl and chlorine, where first most of the HCl is recovered by an absorber which is run with water or diluted HCl, followed by a caustic scrubber for final abatement of HCl and chlorine emissions. An activated carbon adsorber may follow, if necessary, to further reduce PCDD/F emissions. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), organochlorine hydrocarbons, PCDD/F, HCl and Cl2.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAll plants use a combination of techniques for the treatment of the combined waste gas stream prior to its release. Nearly all plants are based on a four-stage treatment process:\n\nStep 1: physical separation - KO drum or demister.\nStep 2: thermal treatment, either:\nan incineration plant for the thermal treatment of liquid residues, which also acts as a thermal oxidiser for gaseous streams; or\na thermal oxidiser which treats only gaseous streams.\nStep 3: wet scrubber to recover HCl.\nStep 4: caustic scrubber to remove any residual HCl.\n\nThe data on the design of the combined treatment collected from the questionnaires are summarised in the tables below.\n\n\nTable 11.18:\tTechniques applied in the shared vent treatment unit \n\n\nMost plants have devices to reduce entrainment (KO drums, demisters). Most plants use caustic scrubbing after thermal treatment. Some of the higher HCl values are related to plants which, according to the questionnaires, seem not to use demisters or caustic scrubbing. \n\nTwo plants use catalytic oxidisers, one in combination with an activated carbon adsorber. These plants show low emissions of NOX, but high emissions of organic compounds (compared to thermal oxidisers and incinerators) (see Table 11.19 and Table 11.20 below).

The reported averages above the detection limit were in the range of 0.002-0.3 mg/Nm3 for Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and 0.01-0.7 mg/Nm3 for EDC. Catalytic oxidisers reported higher emissions, and for ethene and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) too.\n\nHCl: Most plants reported average concentrations in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3. Three plants reported values below 1 mg/Nm3 and four above (three of them in the range of 12-14 mg/Nm3).  \n\nChlorine: Chlorine concentrations were typically in the range of 0.5-5 mg/Nm3, with three plants below and one above this range.\n\nNOX:  High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the chlorinated compounds, and NOX emissions are to be expected. The reported average emissions were in the range of 9-36 mg/Nm3 for thermal oxidisers and 8-101 mg/Nm3 for incinerators.\n\nCO: Although some incinerators reported CO emissions below 1 mg/Nm3, the average CO emissions for thermal oxidisers and incinerators were typically in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3.\n\nContinuous monitoring of VOCs was in place at the plants using an activated carbon adsorber (one combined with a catalytic oxidiser, one with an incinerator) and at six of the other incinerators.\n\nThe monitoring frequencies for EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and ethane are typically the same (if monitored at all), ranging from weekly monitoring to a singular measurement. The monitoring frequency for chlorine, if performed, is generally similar to that of HCl, ranging from continuous monitoring to a single measurement. The monitoring of PCDD/F is typically carried out once or twice a year. \n\nFor HCl, data from the continuous monitoring over one year from two EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators that use caustic scrubbers for final abatement showed the following distributions for HCl, with average emissions of 4.4 mg/Nm3 and below 2 mg/Nm3.\n\n\nTable 11.21:\tDistribution of HCl emissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators\n\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions from the combustion of fuels (CO, NOX).\nWaste water from the caustic scrubber.\nIf an activated carbon adsorber is used, waste from the spent adsorbent.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nThermal oxidisers will be preferred if liquid residues are not incinerated on site.\n\nEconomics\nFor an existing plant operated with a catalytic oxidiser, it will be much more cost-efficient, if technically feasible, to upgrade the catalytic oxidiser to achieve a similar VOC abatement performance (whilst maintaining low NOX and PCDD/F emissions) than to replace it with a new thermal oxidiser.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegislation.\n\nExample plants\nSome of the plants from the data collection as indicated above: SolVin, Jemeppe-sur-Sambre (BE); Vinnolit, Gendorf (DE); Vinnolit, Knapsack (Hurth) (DE); Ineos Vinyls, Strenungsund (SE); Shin-Etsu, Botlek (NL); Kem One, Lavera (FR).\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3450412_abstract", "x": 0.55367976, "y": 0.29492655, "title": "PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF WASTE METAL CHLORIDES BY THERMAL TREATMENT", "year": 2019, "text": "The present application relates to a process for the purification of waste materials or industrial by-products comprising chlorine (B), the process comprising the steps of:\na) Preparing a composition (C) by blending or mixing waste materials or industrial by-products comprising chlorine (B) with one or more materials comprising heavy metals (HM)\nb) Reacting (B) and (HM) by thermal treatment of (C)\nc) Separating evaporated heavy metal chloride compounds (HMCC)\nd) Obtaining a solid material after the thermal treatment step.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"11.4.1.3\" title=\"Combined treatment of the waste gas from the EDC-VCM units by thermal treatment (thermal oxidiser or incinerator) and scrubbing\">\n<references_to>2.4.3.5, 11.4.1.1, 11.4.3.5</references_to>\n<referenced_by>11.3.1.3, 11.4.3.5</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nCombined treatment of the waste gas from the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) units by thermal treatment (thermal oxidiser or incinerator) and scrubbing\n\nAfter all recovery options for individual streams have been exhausted, the concentrations of chlorinated compounds and ethylene in the off-gas are further reduced by applying treatment techniques such as those described below.\n\nThe 2003 LVOC BREF [ 190, COM 2003 ] contained a Best Available Techniques (BAT) to connect the vents from normal operations (that contain chlorinated hydrocarbons and/or ethylene or other organics) to a recovery system or to vent gas treatment if their concentrations exceed the following:\n\n\n\n\nIt was considered that where the mass emission of chlorinated hydrocarbons was below 0.025 kg/h and below 2 kg/h for ethylene, the environmental benefits of connection may not be justified by the costs.  \n\nThe data collection confirmed that EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) plants usually route the vents to an oxidiser or incinerator for final abatement and that this may be shared, e.g. to also treat streams from a PVC plant.

Table 11.20 summarises the emission data for the process-related pollutants.\n\n\nTable 11.19:\tEmissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) end-of-pipe treatment - Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) and combustion parameters\n\nTable 11.20:\tEmissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) end-of-pipe treatment - pollutants from process\n\n\nTotal Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC): Most of the plants with thermal oxidisers or incinerators reported average emissions below 5 mg/Nm3. Only a few reported emissions above 5 mg/Nm3 which did not exceed 10 mg/Nm3.\n\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM): For both EDC and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM), the reported monitoring results were mostly below the detection limit or the limit of quantification which differed considerably in the questionnaires (< 0.01 mg/Nm3 to < 2 mg/Nm3). The reported averages above the detection limit were in the range of 0.002-0.3 mg/Nm3 for Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and 0.01-0.7 mg/Nm3 for EDC. Catalytic oxidisers reported higher emissions, and for ethene and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) too.\n\nHCl: Most plants reported average concentrations in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3. Three plants reported values below 1 mg/Nm3 and four above (three of them in the range of 12-14 mg/Nm3).  \n\nChlorine: Chlorine concentrations were typically in the range of 0.5-5 mg/Nm3, with three plants below and one above this range.\n\nNOX:  High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the chlorinated compounds, and NOX emissions are to be expected. The reported average emissions were in the range of 9-36 mg/Nm3 for thermal oxidisers and 8-101 mg/Nm3 for incinerators.\n\nCO: Although some incinerators reported CO emissions below 1 mg/Nm3, the average CO emissions for thermal oxidisers and incinerators were typically in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3.\n\nContinuous monitoring of VOCs was in place at the plants using an activated carbon adsorber (one combined with a catalytic oxidiser, one with an incinerator) and at six of the other incinerators.\n\nThe monitoring frequencies for EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and ethane are typically the same (if monitored at all), ranging from weekly monitoring to a singular measurement. The monitoring frequency for chlorine, if performed, is generally similar to that of HCl, ranging from continuous monitoring to a single measurement. The monitoring of PCDD/F is typically carried out once or twice a year. \n\nFor HCl, data from the continuous monitoring over one year from two EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators that use caustic scrubbers for final abatement showed the following distributions for HCl, with average emissions of 4.4 mg/Nm3 and below 2 mg/Nm3.\n\n\nTable 11.21:\tDistribution of HCl emissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators\n\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions from the combustion of fuels (CO, NOX).\nWaste water from the caustic scrubber.\nIf an activated carbon adsorber is used, waste from the spent adsorbent.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nThermal oxidisers will be preferred if liquid residues are not incinerated on site.\n\nEconomics\nFor an existing plant operated with a catalytic oxidiser, it will be much more cost-efficient, if technically feasible, to upgrade the catalytic oxidiser to achieve a similar VOC abatement performance (whilst maintaining low NOX and PCDD/F emissions) than to replace it with a new thermal oxidiser.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegislation.\n\nExample plants\nSome of the plants from the data collection as indicated above: SolVin, Jemeppe-sur-Sambre (BE); Vinnolit, Gendorf (DE); Vinnolit, Knapsack (Hurth) (DE); Ineos Vinyls, Strenungsund (SE); Shin-Etsu, Botlek (NL); Kem One, Lavera (FR).\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3816197_abstract", "x": 0.58903956, "y": 0.20070714, "title": "A METHOD FOR POST-PROCESSING VINYL CHLORIDE-BASED POLYMER, AND CLOSED-TYPE POST-PROCESSING SYSTEM FOR SAME", "year": 2021, "text": "The present invention provides a post-treatment method of a vinyl chloride-based polymer including (a) preparing a stream containing vinyl chloride-based polymer powder and unreacted vinyl chloride-based monomers by drying a vinyl chloride-based polymer latex in a drying unit (11); (b) filtering the stream containing the vinyl chloride-based polymer powder and the unreacted vinyl chloride-based monomers in a filtering unit (21); and (c) recirculating a gas containing the unreacted vinyl chloride-based monomers discharged from the filtering unit (21) to a latex storage unit (1).", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"11.4.1.3\" title=\"Combined treatment of the waste gas from the EDC-VCM units by thermal treatment (thermal oxidiser or incinerator) and scrubbing\">\n<references_to>2.4.3.5, 11.4.1.1, 11.4.3.5</references_to>\n<referenced_by>11.3.1.3, 11.4.3.5</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nCombined treatment of the waste gas from the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) units by thermal treatment (thermal oxidiser or incinerator) and scrubbing\n\nAfter all recovery options for individual streams have been exhausted, the concentrations of chlorinated compounds and ethylene in the off-gas are further reduced by applying treatment techniques such as those described below.\n\nThe 2003 LVOC BREF [ 190, COM 2003 ] contained a Best Available Techniques (BAT) to connect the vents from normal operations (that contain chlorinated hydrocarbons and/or ethylene or other organics) to a recovery system or to vent gas treatment if their concentrations exceed the following:\n\n\n\n\nIt was considered that where the mass emission of chlorinated hydrocarbons was below 0.025 kg/h and below 2 kg/h for ethylene, the environmental benefits of connection may not be justified by the costs.  \n\nThe data collection confirmed that EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) plants usually route the vents to an oxidiser or incinerator for final abatement and that this may be shared, e.g. to also treat streams from a PVC plant.

Instead of using a dedicated thermal oxidiser, the thermal oxidation can also be carried out in a liquid waste incineration plant (see Section 11.4.3.5). \n\nTo reduce emissions of PCDD/F, rapid quenching and, if necessary, injection of activated carbon is applied.\n\nAll waste gas streams that contain organic compounds are treated with a combined treatment consisting of a thermal oxidiser or a liquid/waste gas incinerator, an HCl absorber and a caustic scrubber, possibly combined with a pre-scrubber and/or a final activated carbon adsorber, in order to minimise emissions of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), organochlorine pollutants including PCDD/F, HCl and Cl2. And combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO.        \n\nTechnical description\nAll waste gas streams from the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) installations that contain organic compounds are combined (following measures to reduce the load as described in Section 11.4.1.1.2). This includes:\n\nthe process vents from direct chlorination and oxychlorination;\nthe overhead vents and possibly light ends from product purification and recovery (washing, distillation);\nvents from the waste water pretreatment;\nwaste gas from the incineration of liquid residues when it is sent to the combined treatment as a second line of abatement;\nvents from low-pressure storage tanks, depending on the tank location.\n\nThe combined waste gas generally contains HCl, several chlorinated hydrocarbons (mainly        EDC, carbon tetrachloride, CHCl3, dichloromethane, C2HCl3, C2H2, Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM), C2HCl3O, vinyl acetylene, chloroethane) and unreacted ethylene. Depending on the HCl concentration, the first step of the combined treatment is a wet pre-scrubber to reduce the HCl content before incineration/oxidation, in order to recover HCl and reduce the potential for PCDD/F formation. The following incineration/oxidation is performed in such a way as to almost completely destroy the chlorinated hydrocarbons from the waste gas and, for gas/liquid incineration, the liquids (including contaminants like PCDD/F) and to avoid de novo formation of PCDD/F (optimised design including turbulent burners, sufficient minimum residence time and temperature, rapid quenching). The combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO. For further details, see Section 2.4.3.5.6 for thermal oxidisers and the Waste Incineration (WI) BREF for incinerators.\n\nFollowing the oxidation/incineration, the waste gas is scrubbed in two steps to remove HCl and chlorine, where first most of the HCl is recovered by an absorber which is run with water or diluted HCl, followed by a caustic scrubber for final abatement of HCl and chlorine emissions. An activated carbon adsorber may follow, if necessary, to further reduce PCDD/F emissions. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), organochlorine hydrocarbons, PCDD/F, HCl and Cl2.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAll plants use a combination of techniques for the treatment of the combined waste gas stream prior to its release. Nearly all plants are based on a four-stage treatment process:\n\nStep 1: physical separation - KO drum or demister.\nStep 2: thermal treatment, either:\nan incineration plant for the thermal treatment of liquid residues, which also acts as a thermal oxidiser for gaseous streams; or\na thermal oxidiser which treats only gaseous streams.\nStep 3: wet scrubber to recover HCl.\nStep 4: caustic scrubber to remove any residual HCl.\n\nThe data on the design of the combined treatment collected from the questionnaires are summarised in the tables below.\n\n\nTable 11.18:\tTechniques applied in the shared vent treatment unit \n\n\nMost plants have devices to reduce entrainment (KO drums, demisters). Most plants use caustic scrubbing after thermal treatment. Some of the higher HCl values are related to plants which, according to the questionnaires, seem not to use demisters or caustic scrubbing. \n\nTwo plants use catalytic oxidisers, one in combination with an activated carbon adsorber. These plants show low emissions of NOX, but high emissions of organic compounds (compared to thermal oxidisers and incinerators) (see Table 11.19 and Table 11.20 below).

These plants show low emissions of NOX, but high emissions of organic compounds (compared to thermal oxidisers and incinerators) (see Table 11.19 and Table 11.20 below). They are therefore not considered Best Available Techniques (BAT) candidates.\n\nTable 11.19 summarises the emission data received for the pollutants that are related to the combustion process.

Only a few reported emissions above 5 mg/Nm3 which did not exceed 10 mg/Nm3.\n\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM): For both EDC and Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM), the reported monitoring results were mostly below the detection limit or the limit of quantification which differed considerably in the questionnaires (< 0.01 mg/Nm3 to < 2 mg/Nm3). The reported averages above the detection limit were in the range of 0.002-0.3 mg/Nm3 for Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and 0.01-0.7 mg/Nm3 for EDC. Catalytic oxidisers reported higher emissions, and for ethene and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) too.\n\nHCl: Most plants reported average concentrations in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3. Three plants reported values below 1 mg/Nm3 and four above (three of them in the range of 12-14 mg/Nm3).  \n\nChlorine: Chlorine concentrations were typically in the range of 0.5-5 mg/Nm3, with three plants below and one above this range.\n\nNOX:  High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the chlorinated compounds, and NOX emissions are to be expected. The reported average emissions were in the range of 9-36 mg/Nm3 for thermal oxidisers and 8-101 mg/Nm3 for incinerators.\n\nCO: Although some incinerators reported CO emissions below 1 mg/Nm3, the average CO emissions for thermal oxidisers and incinerators were typically in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3.\n\nContinuous monitoring of VOCs was in place at the plants using an activated carbon adsorber (one combined with a catalytic oxidiser, one with an incinerator) and at six of the other incinerators.\n\nThe monitoring frequencies for EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and ethane are typically the same (if monitored at all), ranging from weekly monitoring to a singular measurement. The monitoring frequency for chlorine, if performed, is generally similar to that of HCl, ranging from continuous monitoring to a single measurement. The monitoring of PCDD/F is typically carried out once or twice a year. \n\nFor HCl, data from the continuous monitoring over one year from two EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators that use caustic scrubbers for final abatement showed the following distributions for HCl, with average emissions of 4.4 mg/Nm3 and below 2 mg/Nm3.\n\n\nTable 11.21:\tDistribution of HCl emissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators\n\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions from the combustion of fuels (CO, NOX).\nWaste water from the caustic scrubber.\nIf an activated carbon adsorber is used, waste from the spent adsorbent.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nThermal oxidisers will be preferred if liquid residues are not incinerated on site.\n\nEconomics\nFor an existing plant operated with a catalytic oxidiser, it will be much more cost-efficient, if technically feasible, to upgrade the catalytic oxidiser to achieve a similar VOC abatement performance (whilst maintaining low NOX and PCDD/F emissions) than to replace it with a new thermal oxidiser.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegislation.\n\nExample plants\nSome of the plants from the data collection as indicated above: SolVin, Jemeppe-sur-Sambre (BE); Vinnolit, Gendorf (DE); Vinnolit, Knapsack (Hurth) (DE); Ineos Vinyls, Strenungsund (SE); Shin-Etsu, Botlek (NL); Kem One, Lavera (FR).\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3491942_abstract", "x": 0.73636067, "y": 0.44793504, "title": "APPARATUS AND METHODS FOR COLLECTING EMISSIONS FROM A DEVICE", "year": 2019, "text": "An apparatus (1) for collecting emissions from a device (2), the apparatus (1) comprises:\nan inlet (10) which receives emissions from a device (2);\nan outlet (11) for a collecting assembly (13); and\na pump assembly (12) which includes a pump (120), the pump (120) being in fluid communication with the inlet (10) and operable to draw emissions from the inlet (10) to the outlet (11) for the collecting assembly (13),\nwherein the pump assembly (12) is configured such that, in use, emissions are drawn from the inlet (10) intermittently.

And combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO.        \n\nTechnical description\nAll waste gas streams from the EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) installations that contain organic compounds are combined (following measures to reduce the load as described in Section 11.4.1.1.2). This includes:\n\nthe process vents from direct chlorination and oxychlorination;\nthe overhead vents and possibly light ends from product purification and recovery (washing, distillation);\nvents from the waste water pretreatment;\nwaste gas from the incineration of liquid residues when it is sent to the combined treatment as a second line of abatement;\nvents from low-pressure storage tanks, depending on the tank location.\n\nThe combined waste gas generally contains HCl, several chlorinated hydrocarbons (mainly        EDC, carbon tetrachloride, CHCl3, dichloromethane, C2HCl3, C2H2, Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM), C2HCl3O, vinyl acetylene, chloroethane) and unreacted ethylene. Depending on the HCl concentration, the first step of the combined treatment is a wet pre-scrubber to reduce the HCl content before incineration/oxidation, in order to recover HCl and reduce the potential for PCDD/F formation. The following incineration/oxidation is performed in such a way as to almost completely destroy the chlorinated hydrocarbons from the waste gas and, for gas/liquid incineration, the liquids (including contaminants like PCDD/F) and to avoid de novo formation of PCDD/F (optimised design including turbulent burners, sufficient minimum residence time and temperature, rapid quenching). The combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO.

This includes:\n\nthe process vents from direct chlorination and oxychlorination;\nthe overhead vents and possibly light ends from product purification and recovery (washing, distillation);\nvents from the waste water pretreatment;\nwaste gas from the incineration of liquid residues when it is sent to the combined treatment as a second line of abatement;\nvents from low-pressure storage tanks, depending on the tank location.\n\nThe combined waste gas generally contains HCl, several chlorinated hydrocarbons (mainly        EDC, carbon tetrachloride, CHCl3, dichloromethane, C2HCl3, C2H2, Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM), C2HCl3O, vinyl acetylene, chloroethane) and unreacted ethylene. Depending on the HCl concentration, the first step of the combined treatment is a wet pre-scrubber to reduce the HCl content before incineration/oxidation, in order to recover HCl and reduce the potential for PCDD/F formation. The following incineration/oxidation is performed in such a way as to almost completely destroy the chlorinated hydrocarbons from the waste gas and, for gas/liquid incineration, the liquids (including contaminants like PCDD/F) and to avoid de novo formation of PCDD/F (optimised design including turbulent burners, sufficient minimum residence time and temperature, rapid quenching). The combustion is controlled in order to control emissions of NOX and CO. For further details, see Section 2.4.3.5.6 for thermal oxidisers and the Waste Incineration (WI) BREF for incinerators.\n\nFollowing the oxidation/incineration, the waste gas is scrubbed in two steps to remove HCl and chlorine, where first most of the HCl is recovered by an absorber which is run with water or diluted HCl, followed by a caustic scrubber for final abatement of HCl and chlorine emissions. An activated carbon adsorber may follow, if necessary, to further reduce PCDD/F emissions. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC), organochlorine hydrocarbons, PCDD/F, HCl and Cl2.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAll plants use a combination of techniques for the treatment of the combined waste gas stream prior to its release. Nearly all plants are based on a four-stage treatment process:\n\nStep 1: physical separation - KO drum or demister.\nStep 2: thermal treatment, either:\nan incineration plant for the thermal treatment of liquid residues, which also acts as a thermal oxidiser for gaseous streams; or\na thermal oxidiser which treats only gaseous streams.\nStep 3: wet scrubber to recover HCl.\nStep 4: caustic scrubber to remove any residual HCl.\n\nThe data on the design of the combined treatment collected from the questionnaires are summarised in the tables below.\n\n\nTable 11.18:\tTechniques applied in the shared vent treatment unit \n\n\nMost plants have devices to reduce entrainment (KO drums, demisters). Most plants use caustic scrubbing after thermal treatment. Some of the higher HCl values are related to plants which, according to the questionnaires, seem not to use demisters or caustic scrubbing. \n\nTwo plants use catalytic oxidisers, one in combination with an activated carbon adsorber. These plants show low emissions of NOX, but high emissions of organic compounds (compared to thermal oxidisers and incinerators) (see Table 11.19 and Table 11.20 below). They are therefore not considered Best Available Techniques (BAT) candidates.\n\nTable 11.19 summarises the emission data received for the pollutants that are related to the combustion process. Table 11.20 summarises the emission data for the process-related pollutants.\n\n\nTable 11.19:\tEmissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) end-of-pipe treatment - Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) and combustion parameters\n\nTable 11.20:\tEmissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) end-of-pipe treatment - pollutants from process\n\n\nTotal Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC): Most of the plants with thermal oxidisers or incinerators reported average emissions below 5 mg/Nm3.

The reported averages above the detection limit were in the range of 0.002-0.3 mg/Nm3 for Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and 0.01-0.7 mg/Nm3 for EDC. Catalytic oxidisers reported higher emissions, and for ethene and Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) too.\n\nHCl: Most plants reported average concentrations in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3. Three plants reported values below 1 mg/Nm3 and four above (three of them in the range of 12-14 mg/Nm3).  \n\nChlorine: Chlorine concentrations were typically in the range of 0.5-5 mg/Nm3, with three plants below and one above this range.\n\nNOX:  High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the chlorinated compounds, and NOX emissions are to be expected. The reported average emissions were in the range of 9-36 mg/Nm3 for thermal oxidisers and 8-101 mg/Nm3 for incinerators.\n\nCO: Although some incinerators reported CO emissions below 1 mg/Nm3, the average CO emissions for thermal oxidisers and incinerators were typically in the range of 1-10 mg/Nm3.\n\nContinuous monitoring of VOCs was in place at the plants using an activated carbon adsorber (one combined with a catalytic oxidiser, one with an incinerator) and at six of the other incinerators.\n\nThe monitoring frequencies for EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and ethane are typically the same (if monitored at all), ranging from weekly monitoring to a singular measurement. The monitoring frequency for chlorine, if performed, is generally similar to that of HCl, ranging from continuous monitoring to a single measurement. The monitoring of PCDD/F is typically carried out once or twice a year. \n\nFor HCl, data from the continuous monitoring over one year from two EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators that use caustic scrubbers for final abatement showed the following distributions for HCl, with average emissions of 4.4 mg/Nm3 and below 2 mg/Nm3.\n\n\nTable 11.21:\tDistribution of HCl emissions from EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) incinerators\n\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions from the combustion of fuels (CO, NOX).\nWaste water from the caustic scrubber.\nIf an activated carbon adsorber is used, waste from the spent adsorbent.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nThermal oxidisers will be preferred if liquid residues are not incinerated on site.\n\nEconomics\nFor an existing plant operated with a catalytic oxidiser, it will be much more cost-efficient, if technically feasible, to upgrade the catalytic oxidiser to achieve a similar VOC abatement performance (whilst maintaining low NOX and PCDD/F emissions) than to replace it with a new thermal oxidiser.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegislation.\n\nExample plants\nSome of the plants from the data collection as indicated above: SolVin, Jemeppe-sur-Sambre (BE); Vinnolit, Gendorf (DE); Vinnolit, Knapsack (Hurth) (DE); Ineos Vinyls, Strenungsund (SE); Shin-Etsu, Botlek (NL); Kem One, Lavera (FR).\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3534674_abstract", "x": 0.7328666, "y": 0.29732862, "title": "INDUCTION HEATING APPARATUS AND METHODS", "year": 2019, "text": "An assembly for use in treating gaseous exhaust emissions has an inductive heater mounted next to a gaseous emissions treatment unit.
