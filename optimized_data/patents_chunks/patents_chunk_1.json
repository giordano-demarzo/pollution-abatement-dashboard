The VOCs and formaldehyde are oxidised/burnt and the heat is recovered as steam or for electricity generation. For a more detailed description of thermal oxidisers see Section 3.5.1.2.5 of the CWW BREF and for a more detailed description of combustion units see Sections 2.3.2 (Combustion engines) and 2.4 (Steam processes) of the Large Combustion Plants (LCP) BREF.\n\nTechnical description\nIn the silver process, the off-gas has high heating value (typically 2 200 kJ/Nm3 or 4 700 MJ/t of 100 % formaldehyde) because it contains excess hydrogen. This is due to the fact that the silver process operates under air deficit and this leads to free hydrogen resulting from the methanol dehydrogenation reaction. The off-gas is therefore amenable to combustion. The combustion can be in a dedicated thermal oxidiser with steam production or in a central boiler plant. Thermal oxidation has an estimated efficiency of 99.8 % .\n\nGiven the possibly high hydrogen content (and therefore probable high calorific value) of the process gas purge stream, it could alternatively be combusted beneficially alone or along with commercial and/or other non-commercial fuels in gas engines or conventional boilers in order to recover energy.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units. Another option is to use more than one treatment unit to treat waste gas streams from different parts of the TDI/MDI process separately. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons), HCl, chlorine and NOX to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThermal oxidisers\nExcept for one outlier, industry reported oxidisers to achieve average Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) concentrations of 0.1-3.4 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2). Concentrations of TCM are generally claimed to be below the limit of detection.\n\nRTOs\nRegenerative thermal oxidisers are only used at one site. They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating.

Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units. Another option is to use more than one treatment unit to treat waste gas streams from different parts of the TDI/MDI process separately. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons), HCl, chlorine and NOX to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThermal oxidisers\nExcept for one outlier, industry reported oxidisers to achieve average Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) concentrations of 0.1-3.4 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2). Concentrations of TCM are generally claimed to be below the limit of detection.\n\nRTOs\nRegenerative thermal oxidisers are only used at one site. They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each. Flows are in the range of 1 800-2 400 Nm3/h and the oxygen content is in the range of 16-18 vol-%.\n\n\nTable 10.13:\tEmissions from MDI production after combined treatment (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO) and caustic scrubber)\n\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)\nThe nitrogen oxide emissions of a DNT plant can be reduced by 99.5 % and the VOC emissions reduced by 99.8 % (2003 LVOC BREF, [ 190, COM 2003 ]).\n\nIndustry reported that one oxidiser with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) achieves an average concentration of 92 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with a maximum concentration (daily average from continuous measurement) of 150 mg/Nm3.\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)\nIndustry reported that two oxidisers with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) achieve average concentrations of 202 mg/Nm3 and 218 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with maximum concentrations (for 30-minute samples) of 280-320 mg/Nm3.\n\nWet scrubbing\nHCl: From the air emission survey (Section 10.3.1.5.2), reported maximum HCl emissions were typically (all but two plants) below 10 mg/Nm3 both for combined treatment and for scrubbers without a thermal oxidiser. Average emissions were in the range of < 0.11-3 mg/Nm3, with three oxidisers reporting higher emissions. See also Table 10.13. HCl emissions will depend on the content of HCl and chlorinated hydrocarbons in the raw gas and are mainly expected from the phosgenation units. \nChlorine: Chlorine is not expected to be in the raw waste gas from the MDI/TDI process but may be present if the combined treatment also treats waste gas from the upstream or integrated chlorine production. Chlorine may also be formed in small quantities from the oxidation of HCl. In the air emission survey (see Section 10.3.1.5.2), all average emissions of chlorine reported were < 1 mg/Nm3 which is near the limit of quantification (typically about 0.5 mg/Nm3).

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR).

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13.

High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR).

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR).

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low.

This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6.

Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each. Flows are in the range of 1 800-2 400 Nm3/h and the oxygen content is in the range of 16-18 vol-%.\n\n\nTable 10.13:\tEmissions from MDI production after combined treatment (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO) and caustic scrubber)\n\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)\nThe nitrogen oxide emissions of a DNT plant can be reduced by 99.5 % and the VOC emissions reduced by 99.8 % (2003 LVOC BREF, [ 190, COM 2003 ]).\n\nIndustry reported that one oxidiser with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) achieves an average concentration of 92 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with a maximum concentration (daily average from continuous measurement) of 150 mg/Nm3.\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)\nIndustry reported that two oxidisers with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) achieve average concentrations of 202 mg/Nm3 and 218 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with maximum concentrations (for 30-minute samples) of 280-320 mg/Nm3.\n\nWet scrubbing\nHCl: From the air emission survey (Section 10.3.1.5.2), reported maximum HCl emissions were typically (all but two plants) below 10 mg/Nm3 both for combined treatment and for scrubbers without a thermal oxidiser.

This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR).

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13.

This in turn could lead to a reduction in NOX emissions from the cracker furnace due to the avoidance of elevated peak flame temperatures that can result from the presence of hydrogen (H2) in fuel gas under some firing conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNo information provided.\n\nCross-media effects\nEnergy consumption for hydrogen separation and purification.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe applicability may be restricted where the energy demand for recovery is excessive due to the low hydrogen content or when there is no demand for hydrogen.\n\nEconomics\nHydrogen is a useful chemical feedstock; its value to an operator may exceed the cost of other supplies, even when including the cost of separation.\n\nOn the other hand, fuel gas (including its hydrogen content) is available as a by-product and can be used to displace natural gas (or other fuels) which have to be purchased.

To be able to do so, it is necessary to increase the temperature and pressure of the steam by compression. In some large plants mechanical thermo-compressors are used. They are normally electrically driven and the distillation does not need any external steam to heat the evaporator. The compressor recompresses low-pressure steam from the distillation column and feeds it to the evaporator. At low feed concentrations, a compressor can reduce the energy needed by up to 90 %. These machines are big because they have to operate under vacuum and require a large investment, but they can be used where high steam prices allow large investments.\nEnergy recovery from condenser: a large amount of low-energy heat is removed in the distillation condenser (if no thermo-compressor is used).

In this manner, when gas 1 and gas 2 having different desorption timings are adsorbed to an adsorbent, a gas rich in gas 1, and a gas rich in gas 2 may be recovered separately from each other.

Otherwise energy should be recovered (by combustion and heat recovery in a combustion plant or a thermal oxidiser). Flaring should only be used for safety reasons or for non-routine operations.\n\nAll of the techniques shown below are described in Section 2.4 of this document, in the REF BREF or in the CWW BREF. The techniques listed below are widely applied in aromatic complexes. However, not all techniques are applied in all plants; the combination of techniques that can be applied will be dependent on the configuration of the complex. \n\nCondensation and cryogenic condensation: Condensers are used to recover materials and/or reduce the VOC content in the process-related vent streams. Cryogenic separation (cold box) is used to recover expensive/scarce raw materials (e.g. hydrogen or methane) from recycle compressor purges or other vent streams. This technique is used, for example, in BB1, BB3 and BB4 units.\nAdsorption: Adsorption using activated carbon or other adsorbents enables the recovery of hydrocarbons (feedstock, by-products, products or solvents) from the gaseous stream.\nRecovery of energy from process streams (calorific value): The gaseous stream is sent to the fuel gas system/furnace to recover energy from the VOCs contained in such a stream. Normal operating pressures should allow the fuel gas produced in the process to be fed directly to the fuel gas system.\nGas recompression to recover energy or feedstock: Some units/unit operations are designed to operate under vacuum or low pressures. In this case, the overhead vents have a lower pressure than the vent header or fuel gas header; they can be recompressed and sent to the fuel gas network or a furnace. Gas recompression is used to fully recover some or all of the hydrocarbons that would otherwise be vented to the final treatment, or, on some occasions, to flare.\nRecovery of feedstock: Some gas streams contain valuable chemicals and are returned to the process for recovery.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2851454_abstract", "x": 0.53625125, "y": 0.27379674, "title": "METHOD FOR RECOVERING METAL FROM SOLUTION, SYSTEM FOR RECOVERING METAL FROM SOLUTION, AND SYSTEM FOR RECOVERING LITHIUM FROM SALT WATER", "year": 2015, "text": "In a method for recovering a metal from a solution, a first electrode that includes a metal for recovery and a second electrode that includes a metal different from the metal for recovery are prepared.

Where fuel gas is used, it tends to have a high hydrogen content since hydrogen is available at many sites from the upstream chlorine production (chlor-alkali process). The replacement of natural gas by hydrogen leads to a higher flame temperature and therefore higher potential for the formation of NOX which can be prevented/compensated by primary measures. The sulphur content of the fuel is typically low. In the European Union (EU), no plants use liquid fuels.\n\nb)\tFurnace design\nEDC crackers are cabin-type furnaces. EDC passes through one or several coils located inside the 'cabin'. The heat is delivered by burners fixed to the lateral walls of the cabin in horizontal furnaces or at several different height levels in vertical ones. In order to achieve good distribution of the heat to the coil, without local overheating of tubes, it is important to distribute burners along the vertical surface of the cabin and to use flat flame or terrace wall burners (as already included in the 2003 LVOC Best Available Techniques (BAT) conclusions).

However, the potential may be very limited, when the resulting flame temperatures are still similar to olefin crackers (especially when hydrogen is burnt).\nc)\tCombustion control\nSee the Large Combustion Plants (LCP) BREF (gas-fired furnaces).

Five sites reported average emissions even slightly below 50 mg/Nm3 (35-48 mg/Nm3). Only two sites (#17 and #9) reported average emissions (far) above 100 mg/Nm3, with 164 mg/Nm3 and 181 mg/Nm3.\n\nNOX emissions depend on the flame temperatures which depend on many technical parameters such as the burner type, use of hydrogen as a fuel, air excess and air preheating. The data revealed no correlation between NOX emissions and the use of hydrogen as a fuel. \n\nAir preheating which is used to reduce the consumption of fuel and related emissions to air may lead to increased NOX emissions, due to higher flame temperatures. According to the data collection, less than half of the EDC crackers in the European Union (EU) apply air preheating (some of them partially) (sites #1, #4, #9, #17, #18 and #19). Some of them show low NOX emissions, but more furnaces are in the upper range, amongst them the two with the highest NOX emissions (sites #9 and #17, site #9 also using hydrogen as fuel).\n\nCO: Average CO emission show a wide spread between the different furnaces.

In the LVOC sector, it is a recovery technique generally applied close to the source of the emission as an initial treatment step. Further treatment of the waste gas stream is normally applied downstream. \n\nDescription\nCondensation is carried out by means of either direct cooling (i.e. contact between the gas and cooling liquid) or indirect cooling (i.e. cooling via a heat exchanger). The choice of coolant will depend on the temperature that needs to be achieved.\n\nTechnical description\nA full description of the different types of condensation systems available is given in the CWW BREF, ranging from the simplest water-cooled systems through to the use of refrigerants and closed-cycle inert gas condensation systems.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nCondensation enables the recovery of raw materials and products. This in turn will reduce the required size/capacity of subsequent downstream waste gas treatment equipment.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAdditional performance information can be found in the CWW BREF.\n\nCross-media effects\nIndirect cooling is preferred because direct cooling results in an additional separation stage and waste water effluent. Cooling water systems can consume significant quantities of water, if the water is not recycled. Refrigerated systems will consume material and energy. There is also the possibility of diffuse emissions of refrigerant gases\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nCondensation is a compact and robust technology with a high removal efficiency and the ability to recover VOCs for reuse. Simple cooling water systems are easily retrofitted. More complex refrigerant-based systems can be skid-mounted for retrofit or a new plant. Cryogenic condensation is not suitable for wet gas streams because of ice formation. The applicability may be limited by coolant availability. The applicability may also depend on the level of site cooling  integration and optimisation (e.g. using pinch analysis). \n\nEconomics\nAt its simplest, condensation is usually a low-cost technique. There is the potential benefit of product recovery. Further information is provided in the CWW BREF.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driver for using condensation or cryogenic condensation is economic, to recover materials for reuse and reduce the pollutant load on the end-of-pipe treatment.\n\nExample plants\nCondensation is used in many LVOC processes, including the following:\n\nIn phenol production, cumene is oxidised by air to produce cumene hydroperoxide. Condensation is used to recover unreacted cumene.\nIn toluene diisocyanate (TDI) production, toluene is nitrated to produce dinitrotoluene (DNT).

It is normally applied to a combined waste gas stream drawn from different parts of the same LVOC process or from a number of different LVOC processes. Ideally, some of these vent streams will have already received some level of treatment to reduce the loading to the thermal oxidiser and recover materials for reuse, e.g. KO drums, condenser or absorber. A full description of the thermal oxidation process (including regenerative thermal oxidation) is given in the CWW BREF. A summary of this description and its applicability to LVOC is given below.\n\nDescription\nThermal oxidation (often referred to as 'incineration', although the term 'incineration' should be limited to combustion of liquid and solid waste) is the oxidation of the VOC content of waste gases and/or odorants in a waste gas stream that is heated above its auto-ignition temperature in a combustion chamber for sufficient time to ensure complete combustion to carbon dioxide and water.\n\nTechnical description\nTechniques to reduce VOC emissions to air from the process under normal operating conditions include:\n\ncombustion control: controlling the oxygen concentration and the temperature profile within the oxidiser;\noxidiser design: sizing (e.g. residence time), design features (mixing);\noxidiser type: regenerative, once-through, etc.\n\nThe combustion is optimised to maximise the removal of organic compounds, while minimising emissions to air of CO and NOX.\n\nTechniques to reduce NOX emissions within the thermal oxidiser include:\n\nthe use of low-NOX burners; \nthe reduction of the need for support fuel, e.g. by using a regenerative thermal oxidiser (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO));\nthe choice of a support fuel with a low nitrogen content.\n\nOther techniques to reduce NOX emissions are:\n \nremoval of NOX precursors from the process off-gas streams: remove (if possible, for reuse) most of the NOX precursors prior to thermal treatment, e.g. by scrubbing, condensation or adsorption (see for example Section 10.4.1.1 for DNT plants);\nfinal abatement by Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) (see Section 2.4.2.1). \n\nA full description of the thermal oxidation process and the types of thermal oxidation equipment available is given in the CWW BREF.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThermal oxidation can achieve almost complete destruction of the VOC species present in the waste gas stream.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe VOC destruction rate is 98 % to > 99.9 %, with residual VOCs (expressed as Total Organic Carbon (TOC)) of 0.5-30 mg/Nm3.\n\nData for emissions of VOCs when using thermal oxidation as an abatement technique have been reported for the production of:\n\nTDI/MDI (see Section 10.4.1);\nformaldehyde (see Section 6.4.1);\nphenol (see Section 8.4.1);\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\nNOX emissions from thermal oxidation depend on the concentration of nitrogen-containing compounds in the waste gas, the flame temperature and the need for support fuel. Low NOX emissions can be achieved with regenerative thermal oxidation, especially when replacing the combustion of support fuel with electric heating (see example in Section 10.4.1).\n\nData for emissions of NOX and PCDD/F when using thermal oxidation as an abatement technique have been reported for the production of:\n\nTDI/MDI (see Section 10.4.1);\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\nCross-media effects\nThermal oxidation will also generate emissions typical of combustion plants, i.e. CO and NOX. NOX emissions may require subsequent abatement..\nIn the unfavourable event that the VOC content of the waste gas stream is not sufficient to support combustion, support fuels are used. The use of a support fuel will have a negative effect on the overall energy efficiency of the process and may increase emissions to air (e.g. NOX, CO).\nAny sulphur present in the waste gas (or support fuel) will be emitted as SO2, and halogens as hydrogen halides. Further treatment of the exhaust gas may be needed to abate these emissions.\nIf the VOCs have a high chlorine content, the thermal oxidiser will need to be designed and operated to prevent and minimise the formation of dioxins and furans, e.g. by rapid cooling of the exhaust gases.\nAbatement of the exhaust gases emitted from the thermal oxidiser may produce liquid and/or solid wastes requiring further treatment or disposal.\nHeat from thermal oxidation can be used to generate steam and electricity to be used on or off site if the heat available is sufficient to justify the additional investment.\n\nMeasures to reduce the cross-media effects can be found in the Large Combustion Plants (LCP), CWW and REF BREFs. The following table is not exhaustive.\n\n\nTable 2.7:\tTechniques to reduce emissions from thermal oxidisers\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThermal oxidisers can be used to reduce emissions from almost all VOC sources, including reactor vents, distillation vents, solvent operations and operations carried out in ovens, dryers and kilns. They can handle minor fluctuations in flow and load, but large fluctuations may require the use of a flare. They are best suited to those processes with moderate to high VOC loadings where recovery of the VOCs is not possible. Low VOC loadings will result in high consumption of support fuel.\n\nThe applicability for low-NOX burners and RTOs  may be restricted by design and/or operational constraints at existing units. The applicability of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to existing units may be restricted by space availability. The applicability of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to existing units may be restricted by the residence time needed for the reaction.\n\nEconomics\nThermal oxidisers are a significant part of the site infrastructure, with associated capital and operating costs.

Formaldehyde leaks can be detected without a sophisticated monitoring system because of the strong odour (detectable at about 0.8 ppm). Fugitive emissions are monitored indirectly by tests on the workspace formaldehyde concentrations to which operators may be exposed. \n\nThe occupational exposure limits (OELs) depend on national regulations in the Member States. Limits are normally expressed as an 8-hour and/or 15-minute time-weighted average. Sometimes a maximum exposure level (Maximum Exposure Level (MEL)) is given. In 2014 in Belgium, the OEL was 0.3 ppm as an 8-hour average with a maximum of four peaks of 0.6 ppm as a 15-minute average and a maximum value of 1 ppm. Whilst the values in other countries may vary, these numbers are not unusual.\n\nFormaldehyde solutions with high concentrations solidify when spilt. Vapour emissions from spills are therefore low and the resulting solid material can be easily removed. If vapours do escape from liquid formaldehyde spills then foams can be used to reduce the loss and water can be sprayed over the vapour cloud.\n\nThe main technique to minimise fugitive emissions is a leak detection and repair (LDAR) programme (see Section 3.5.4.4 of the CWW BREF). Although it is difficult to predict the exact reductions in fugitive emissions that can be achieved by LDAR, it is reported that a quarterly inspection and maintenance programme (I/M) for pumps and valves has an overall efficiency for formaldehyde emissions of about 57 % (see Table 6.6). Monthly I/M for pumps and valves has an overall efficiency of about 69 %. The use of double sealed pumps, application of a rupture disc to relief valves, and monthly I/M for other valves has an overall efficiency of about 91 %. Double mechanical seals and rupture discs are virtually 100 % efficient in reducing emissions from pumps and relief valves .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3434753_abstract", "x": 0.6475504, "y": 0.23531188, "title": "PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF METHANE FROM REFUSE-DERIVED FUEL AND  PLANT THEREOF", "year": 2019, "text": "A process for the production of methane based on the hydrogasification of carbon from refuse-derived fuel in hydrogen atmosphere, and the related production plant is described.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.4.1.2\" title=\"Recovery-reuse of material from hydrogen-containing process off-gas\">\n\n<content>\nRecovery/reuse of material from hydrogen-containing process off-gas\n\nBB1 units:\nThe gases separated after the hydrogenation reactors (or purged if the unit is equipped with a recycle compressor) have reduced concentrations of H2.

Another tank is available for the storage and settlement of the process sludge, collected during the cleaning process run at the end of each process cycle (Figure 9).When biodegradable organic pollutants (for example, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are present in water, SWID system is integrated with a process, based on Ozone, to regenerate the filtration media through the destruction of the organic substances.CONCLUSIONSWith SWID technology, it is possible to manage and treat stormwater runoff flowing on large surface areas, and waste water, by means of highly performing plants, which are also volumetrically compacted, easily to move and without necessity of ground excavation.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"8.4.2.2.1\" title=\"Hydrolysis to decompose organic peroxides\">\n<references_to>8.3.2.1</references_to>\n\n<content>\nHydrolysis to decompose organic peroxides\n\nDescription\nIn order to reduce emissions to water of organic peroxides from the oxidation unit and, if necessary, to protect the downstream biological waste water treatment plant, waste water (mainly from the condensers and the adsorber regeneration, after phase separation) is treated thermally (at temperatures above 100 degC and a high pH) or using a solid catalyst to decompose organic peroxides to non-ecotoxic and more readily biodegradable compounds (such as methanol and formic acid). \n\nThe decomposition reaction may lead to the formation of gas (hydrogen).\nTechnical description\nNo information provided.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nPrevention of increased emissions to water due to malfunctions of the biological treatment which can be caused by high levels of organic peroxides.\nReduced emissions of peroxides to water (although the effect may be low, depending on the removal efficiency in the biological treatment).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor information on environmental performance, see Table 8.2 in Section 8.3.2.1.\n\nNo data were provided for the concentration of peroxides at the outlet of the final treatment but it is expected to be far beyond the detection limits reported in Table 8.2 (50-100 mg Combined Heat and Power (CHP)/l).\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumption of energy (heat).\nPotentially a small waste gas stream (mainly hydrogen).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nNo information provided.\n\nEconomics\nOperational costs are estimated to be low (mainly supply of heat and, if needed, caustic).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental protection.\n\nExample plants\nOf the seven plants in the European Union (EU), four use thermal treatment (Borealis (SF), Porvoo (FI); Ineos Phenol, Gladbeck (DE); Ineos Phenol, Antwerp (BE);  Novapex S.A.S., Roussillon (FR))  and one catalytical treatment (DOMO Caproleuna, Leuna (DE)) (see Table 8.2 in Section 8.3.2.1).\n\nReference literature\n.

Criteria governing the choice of the catalyst for first-stage hydrogenation are:\n\na high hydrogenation activity to fully hydrogenate the diolefins, alkenyl aromatics and other gum precursor compounds, at the lowest possible temperature;\na low polymerisation activity to reduce gum formation to a minimum and allow long enough operating cycles even with highly reactive feeds;\na high selectivity towards the hydrogenation of diolefins and alkenyl aromatics while minimising the hydrogenation of the olefins into paraffins.\n\nCatalysts for first-stage reactors are of two basic types, palladium- or nickel-based catalysts. Both catalysts make use of an alumina carrier. Palladium catalysts are generally more active than nickel catalysts but are (typically) less tolerant to feed poisons. However, this depends to a great extent on the anticipated poisons (feed impurities) that can (occasionally) be present in the pygas feed. Nickel catalyst is disadvantaged in that it requires more stringent loading, activation and unloading procedures. The option of switching from palladium to nickel or vice versa in existing units is restricted due to differences in the activity and the handling procedures.\n\nThe catalyst type is generally dictated by the (anticipated) quality of the raw pygas feed. For clean feed applications, use of palladium catalysts will result in a smaller reactor volume requirement. \n\nThere are various measures that reduce spent catalyst generation:\n\nFeed pretreatment / optimisation of upstream conditions to reduce the ingress of impurities. For example, water or dust removal by applying decanters and coalescers/filters for  protection from water and suspended solids from storage. \nFeed purification: First-stage hydrogenation and removal of the high-boiling fraction, as well as C5 hydrocarbons. C5 hydrocarbons can reduce the amount of fouling-forming compounds in the feed to the second hydrotreatment stage. The two distillation columns involving the removal of the heavy fraction, as well as C5 hydrocarbons, can reduce the amount of fouling-forming compounds in the feed to the first-stage hydrogenation, but feasibility is dependent on the configuration of the plant. Stabilisation of the high-boiling fraction can be important to avoid issues in downstream processes or fuel oil blending, e.g. when hydrogenated C5 hydrocarbons are routed to the petrol production in a refinery.\nLower operating temperatures to avoid oligomer or gum formation. \nProper liquid recycling to dilute the inlet concentration of diolefins to minimise polymerisation and subsequent coking.\nProper regeneration of the catalyst.\nTimely regeneration as coke on the catalyst becomes harder and, as such, hydrogen stripping becomes less effective and steam-air stripping is required. The latter always comes with some (slight) catalyst deactivation and subsequently each restart requires a slightly higher start-of-run temperature.\n\nSpent hydrogenation catalyst is removed from the reactors periodically and is normally returned to the catalyst manufacturer or specialised companies for regeneration or for recovery of the (precious) metal contained on the catalyst (nickel or palladium). This has economic reasons and environmental benefits.

The process technology addresses the management of strategically important REEs resources relevant for green energy and smart/hybrid technology. The methodology involves cheap mineral acid for near quantitative RE metal sequential digestion and extractive (liquid-liquid) separation protocols using the selective extractant ligand molecules and hydrometallurgical process conditions to separate Y, Eu, and Tb, to more than 99% purity and Gd, La and Ce to elevated purities each from the metal digested FP waste fractions. The developed technology has potential for scale up on industrial scale, re-use of extractant and organic phase as well as extended use for recovering RE metals from other e-waste after optimizations. The process can be employed to REE mixtures from e-waste as well as mining tailings origin. The process has the advantage over inseparable combined digested phosphor fractions as well as over inefficient leaching of Tb from LAP phosphor.

Unless otherwise stated, all the technique descriptions (10-heading format) can be found in the Large Combustion Plants (LCP) BREF and so are not repeated here.\n\n\nPrimary techniques for NOX\n\nChoice of fuel: Increasing the use of gas (i.e. natural gas and/or fuel gas) instead of liquid fuels will reduce the formation of NOX. However, the applicability may be limited by several factors: if the fuel gas has a high hydrogen content this could result in higher combustion temperatures and hence increased NOX formation; the design of the burners in the case of existing plants; or the overall hydrocarbon balance of the site (liquid or solid residues, produced on site, that have a high calorific value will be burnt on site to provide energy where it is not economical to recover substances from the residues).\n\nLow-NOX and ultra-low-NOX burners: `Low-NOX' burners have the potential to reduce NOX formation because of their ability to reduce both peak flame temperature and peak oxygen concentration through the use of the staged addition of either air or fuel. The effect can be enhanced by the recycling or entrainment of combustion gases as in the case of `ultra-low-NOX' burners. For existing process furnaces/heaters, the applicability may be restricted by their design.\n\nFlue-gas recirculation: Recirculation of part of the flue-gas within the combustion chamber to replace part of the fresh combustion air, with the effect of reducing the oxygen content and therefore reducing the temperature of the flame.  This will reduce the potential for NOX formation. Flue-gas recirculation can be an inherent feature of ultra-low-NOX burners (as discussed above), sometimes referred to as internal flue-gas recirculation, or it can be implemented as a distinct strategy that is not directly linked to ultra-low-NOX burners (external flue-gas recirculation). For existing process furnaces/heaters, the applicability may be restricted by their design (e.g. not applicable to existing EDC crackers).\nStaged combustion: Staged combustion achieves lower NOX emissions by staging the injection of either air or fuel in the near-burner region. The division of fuel or air reduces the oxygen concentration in the primary burner combustion zone, thereby lowering the peak flame temperature and reducing thermal NOX formation. The applicability may be restricted by space constraints when upgrading small process furnaces, limiting the retrofit of fuel/air staging without reducing capacity.  For existing EDC crackers, the applicability may be restricted by the design of the process furnace.  \n\nUse of inert diluents: 'Inert' diluents, e.g. steam, water, nitrogen, are used (either by being premixed with the fuel prior to its combustion or directly injected into the combustion chamber) to reduce the temperature of the flame. Steam injection may increase CO emissions. The technique is generally applicable.\n\n\nSecondary techniques for NOX\n\nSelective non-catalytic reduction (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)). Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is a non-catalytic process for removing nitrogen oxides from combustion flue-gases by gas phase reaction with ammonia or urea at high temperatures (850-1 100 degC). Reductions of 25 % to 75 % can be achieved, reducing NOX emissions to less than 200 mg/m3. Wet scrubbers can be used downstream of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to remove ammonia slip and so enable the deliberate overdosing of ammonia into the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system. The ammonia recovered in the scrubber can be recycled to the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) unit. Applicability to existing process heaters/furnaces may be restricted by the temperature window (900-1 050 degC) and the residence time needed for the reaction. \n\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)), also known as catalytic DeNOX. The ammonia/urea vapour is mixed with the flue-gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300-500 degC, traditional base metals employed at 200-400 degC, and metals and activated carbon for the lowest temperature applications at 150-300 degC. The catalyst's minimum operating temperature depends on the concentration of SO3 (see the CWW BREF). With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), removal efficiencies of 80 % to 95 % can generally be achieved for inlet concentrations over 200 mg/Nm3. Residual NOX stack levels of 10-20 mg/Nm3 can be achieved by using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas-fired boilers and furnaces and NOX emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 can be achieved when firing heavy residues. Applicability to existing process furnaces/heaters may be restricted by space availability.\n\nIt is important to take account of emissions to air of ammonia from the application of both Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). The dosing of ammonia or urea should be optimised for achieving effective NOX reduction without excessive ammonia slip; typical emissions of ammonia from these units are in the range of 5 mg/Nm3 to 15 mg/Nm3.\n\nData for emissions of NOX in connection with abatement techniques have been reported for the process furnaces used to produce:\n\nlower olefins (see Section 3.4.1);\nVinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4154967_abstract", "x": 0.66804856, "y": 0.25089565, "title": "FLUE GAS INTEGRATED DESULFURIZATION AND DENITRATION METHOD BASED ON LOW-TEMPERATURE ADSORPTION PRINCIPLE", "year": 2023, "text": "Provided is a method for desulphurizating and denitrating a flue gas in an integrated manner based on low-temperature adsorption.

This bed introduces a pressure drop into the system that is not compatible with the existing draft in the furnaces. Additional power would be required for the gas handling equipment. Ammonia must be properly injected into the flue-gases, in the proper temperature window, in the proper amount to achieve the expected NOX reduction and to avoid unreacted ammonia slipping through. These constraints are difficult to combine with the process constraints of the operation of the EDC furnace (control of process temperature, of tube wall temperature, of oxygen excess, etc. at variable EDC loads).

The performance (to maximise coke removal) will focus on operating conditions (flow velocity) and the selection of the material used: non-angular, non-abrasive particles are entrained at a concentration of about 0.1 kg to about 10 kg per kg of gas (e.g. nitrogen), and the gas is introduced into the inlet of the furnace tubes at a gas flow rate corresponding to an outlet gas velocity of 25 m/s up to the sonic velocity of said gas, preferably at an outlet gas velocity of about 70 m/s to 200 m/s, thereby avoiding the use of a water scrubber or spray tower. This prevents (or, in combination with thermal decoking, reduces) CO emissions from the process side and emissions from the furnace (although it will increase the dust load for abatement and the resulting waste to be disposed of).

The resulting mixture is heated, and then maintained at the desired temperature and pressure for a fixed period of time whilst passing through a plug flow reactor. \n\nThe temperature range employed is between 269 degC and 290 degC for high-pressure wet oxidation and between 120 degC and 220 degC for low-pressure oxidation. The operating pressure ranges from 80 bar to 120 bar for the high-pressure process and from 8 bar to 29 bar for the low-pressure process. The spent scrubbing liquor's residence time within the plug flow reactor is normally between 45 and 90 minutes, although longer times are required for low operating temperatures. For low-pressure oxidation, a catalyst (e.g. Fe(II)) is required.\n\nSee also the CWW BREF.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAchieved environmental benefits include the reduction of emissions of volatile compounds to air and the reduction of odour emissions.\n\nSulphides will be converted to thiosulphates, sulphites and/or sulphates. This may remove the immediate problem of odorous emissions to air, but the potential for the formation of sulphides still exists, and the likelihood of this will depend on the handling of the effluent, and the operation of the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), which falls within the scope of the CWW BREF. The potential conversion of sulphides only to sulphites may not necessarily avoid problems with the operation of any downstream biological effluent treatment plant. \n\nBesides Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC) may also be reduced, including the organic load from phenols and oils. This could also help reduce the possibility of the performance of any downstream waste water biological treatment plant being adversely affected by receipt of this effluent. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe operating regime of the wet air oxidation plant will have a significant bearing on performance. Increasing the operating temperature, retention time or partial oxygen pressure will increase the proportion of sulphides converted to sulphates (and correspondingly reduce the proportion of sulphides converted to thiosulphates and sulphites), and will also increase the reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) that is achieved.\n\nCross-media effects\nThere will be an energy demand for pumping, heating and pressurisation. However, the oxidation is exothermic and carried out under pressure, so a high degree of heat recovery should be possible, and the process could be autothermal in some circumstances.\n\nThe depressurisation of the treated liquor could liberate some VOCs to air, which may need to be destroyed by incineration, which necessitates further energy (fuel) consumption.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUnder higher temperature operation, bisulphate formation in the absence of sufficient residual caustic could result in acid corrosion. The plant's materials of construction must be appropriate.\n\nEconomics\nLow-temperature (and therefore low-pressure) plants do not need to be constructed to withstand such high pressures, so their capital costs may be lower. However, the need to supply greater airflows in order to maintain efficient mass transfer means that their operating costs can be much higher.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProtection of the workforce by reducing the risk of exposure to hydrogen sulphide. \nImprovement of the operability and robust operation of any downstream biological effluent treatment plant.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique is reported to be used by 11 plants responding to the questionnaire.\n\nReference literature\nNo reference literature provided.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2995320_abstract", "x": 0.74054444, "y": 0.3107783, "title": "DEVICE FOR THE EVAPORATION OF VOLATILE SUBSTANCES", "year": 2016, "text": "The volatile substances evaporation device comprises a body (1) which can house an element (2) impregnated with volatile substances; an electric resistance (4); and a plug (5) for connection to a power grid; and said electrical resistance (4) is positioned in said plug (5) and said plug (5) is movable with respect to said body (1) so that the distance between the element (2) and said electrical resistance (4) is variable, defining at least one position of maximum evaporation and one position of minimum evaporation.It permits very simple adjustable evaporation with a reduced cost compared to other devices with adjustable evaporation.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"10.4.2.3.2\" title=\"Evaporation\">\n\n<content>\nEvaporation\n\nSee the CWW BREF for a description of the technique.\n\nKey steps normally involve concentrating the contaminant in the water stream using evaporation (either single or multiple stages).

In particular, the ozone generator is used to receive oxygen from an oxygen generation system and convert oxygen into ozone, and then feed the ozone into the ultrasonic atomizer through the first pipeline. The ultrasonic atomizer is used to either atomize water by ultrasonic technology before it is mixed with the ozone from the ozone generator to form atomized ozonated water, or atomize ozonated water, which is formed by dissolving ozone in water, to form atomized ozonated water by ultrasonic technology.

Alternatively, adsorption is carried out in adsorption cycles with a constant length which has been determined (and is periodically adjusted) to include a safety margin to ensure low emissions (see Figure 12.5). Desorption is usually performed with low- or medium-pressure steam to regenerate the adsorbent and recover solvent for reuse.

One of these factors is the ageing of the activated carbon which needs to be replaced from time to time by fresh material.\n\nThe design and the operation of the adsorbers can be optimised in terms of recovery or abatement. When used for final abatement, measures are taken to keep emissions low and to avoid peak emissions. These measures include the following:\n\nDesign: An increase of the number of adsorber beds will reduce the increase in inlet concentration when taking adsorbers off-line (e.g. for desorption); the related reduction of the single adsorber bed volume may facilitate cooling after desorption (see below). \nAdsorption management: This feature involves all actions taken by the operator to optimise adsorption performance. They include: intensive (quasi-continuous) monitoring of adsorption performance to optimise on-stream life or regeneration time; procedures that include measures (such as plant shutdown) to be taken in the event that the emission threshold value is reached; ensuring sufficient fresh adsorbent is available (in place) for unplanned end-of-life events; process optimisation system for continuous improvement of adsorption performance (such as process models or six sigma methodology).\nCooling feature prior to alignment: When going back online after regeneration, because of the hot/wet activated carbon bed, there could be a short period when VOCs are not adsorbed optimally: the VOC concentration would then be high but only for a few minutes in an adsorption step of hours.

For a more detailed description of catalytic oxidisers see Section 3.5.1.2.5 in the CWW BREF.\n\nTechnical description\nIn the metal oxide process, the off-gas has a low calorific value (typically 500 kJ/Nm3 or 1 100 MJ/t of 100 % formaldehyde). Off-gas from the oxide process can be burnt in an existing central boiler plant but this tends to reduce the steam production capacity. More efficient combustion is provided by catalytic oxidation. Catalytic oxidisers have typical operating temperatures of 450-500 degC and a conversion efficiency to carbon dioxide and water of 99.7-99.8 %. Typical Pd/Pt wire catalysts on an Al2O3 support have a four- to six-year lifetime. \n\nThe heat transfer fluid used in the oxide process has a vapour pressure and will incur breathing losses. Waste gases from the heat transfer fluid circuit in the metal oxide process are oxidised in the catalytic oxidiser.\n\nSteam production from catalytic oxidisers is small and the feasibility of raising steam this way is determined by local circumstances. However, it is estimated that a catalytic unit can produce 5 000 tonnes of steam per year. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of VOCs to air. \nLower energy consumption for steam production either for formaldehyde production or for other units/processes on site.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nEmissions data are given in Table 6.7. \n\nCross-media effects\nWaste from spent catalyst.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThis technique is applicable to plants with the metal oxide process. The ability to recover energy may be restricted in small stand-alone plants.\n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental legislation.\nEnergy balance/efficiency of the site.\n\nExample plants\nDuPont, Dordrecht (NL); Momentive, Rotterdam (NL); Alder, Trieste (IT); Akzo Nobel, Kristinehamn (SE); Celanese/Hostaform, Frankfurt (DE); Fantoni, Osoppo (IT).\n\nReference literature\nNo reference literature provided.\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}]
