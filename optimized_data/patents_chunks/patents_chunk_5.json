Degradation of inorganic nitrogen compounds (expressed as inorganic N, as the sum of NH4+, NO3-, NO2-) is usually carried out by nitrification and denitrification steps. Figure   4 .143 shows the emission data provided, including (where available) the emission levels for total N. Levels for inorganic N range from 1 to 34 mg/l. The emission levels for total N are usually higher since also organic bound nitrogen is included in the value. The biological WWTPs releasing the highest inorganic N levels (50 and 34 mg/l) were retrofitted in 2004 in order to adjust the treatment capacity or improve performance. In one case, the high values are caused by high NH4+ loadings from an extended fermentation unit, the other case is described in Section 4.3.8.8. The lowest values are achieved where the capacity of the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) allows long residence times, e.g. in the case of *096A,I* with an inorganic N of 1 mg/l and a residence time of seven days. \n\n\nFigure 4.143: Nitrogen emission levels after biological Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n\nRelief of the receiving water body.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nNone believed likely.\n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo information provided.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nGenerally applicable.\n\n\nEconomics\n\nNo information provided.\n\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nReduction of inorganic nitrogen compound releases to receiving waters.\n\n\nReferences to literature and example plants \n\nSee reference plants in Table   3 .29.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3255661_abstract", "x": 0.7512105, "y": 0.21593863, "title": "SUBSTRATE TREATMENT SYSTEMS USING SUPERCRITICAL FLUID", "year": 2017, "text": "Substrate treatment systems are provided.

Where necessary, solvents can be removed from individual waste water streams to enable wet oxidation. Blending enables a wide range of input and the wet oxidation runs autothermally in normal operation. The wet oxidation of waste water streams eliminates about 80 % of the COD load with the remaining COD load being highly biologically degradable (organic compounds with low molecular weight). The conversion of critical compounds (e.g. active ingredients) is very high (usually >99 %). Finally, all waste waters are treated in the biological Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). Heavy metals are separated after wet oxidation as metal oxides. Overall (wet oxidation and biological treatment), an average COD elimination of >99 % is achieved. The sludges from the biological treatment are also treated by wet oxidation, but under less drastic conditions (lower water content). The effluents from the wet oxidation of the sludges are fed back to the biology.\n\nTable   4 .94 gives selected examples for waste water streams pretreated by wet oxidation. \n\n\nFigure 4.122: Joint pretreatment by wet oxidation with O2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main criteria when considering a waste water stream for wet oxidation are:\n\nthe waste water stream contains active ingrdients from API or biocide/plant health product manufacture\nthe waste water stream inhibits nitrification in the biological Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) (inhibition is seen as problematic from 20 % on)\nthe waste water stream contains poorly degradable organic load \nthe waste water stream contains a high COD load. Independent of the biodegradability, high COD are more efficiently (and more cost effective) treated by wet oxidation\nthe waste water stream contains heavy metals\nthe waste water stream contains cyanides. Cyanides do not represent a problem since the wet oxidation is operated at pH 12 - 13. \n\nFigure   4 .123 shows examples of the assessment of waste water streams and the decisions made. \n\nTable 4.94: Examples and results for waste water streams treated by wet oxidation with O2\n\nFigure 4.123: Results of the assessment of waste water streams from an external origin\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n\nhighly efficient combination of pretreatment and biological treatment of waste water streams\nhighly efficient elimination of active ingredients, poorly degradable organic loads, heavy metals, AOX and CHCs\nthe sludge problem is solved as well.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nO2 consumption\nchemicals for pH adjustment\nenergy for pumping.\n\n\nOperational data\n\nTable   4 .95 gives an overview to the operational data of the wet oxidation of waste water streams.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nThe setup is very flexible and provides a pretreatment option for a wide range of waste water streams. The layout for the single unit is possible from 2 to 25 m3/hour. The relatively high investment costs are better justified for larger multipurpose sites or as, in this example, joint pretreatment. The low treatment costs make wet oxidation with O2 an attractive alternative to biological treatment of waste water streams containing high COD loads.

The method consists of mixing the mineral (Cu2S, CuS,CuFeS2, Cu5FeS4, FeS2, FeAsS.NiS, (Ni,Fe)xSy), ground to an appropriate size (2.5 centimetres), with a specific dose of solid reagent in a rotary agglomeration drum and then adding slightly acidified water to obtain a defined water content (5-8%) depending on the type of gangue contained in the metal-containing solid, thereby forming an agglomerate that will form a heap, which is subsequently allowed to stand for a period of several days (20-60 days), during which the conditions required to transform the refractory matrix into a highly soluble solid will be generated. Finally, appropriately regulated irrigation is applied, thus resulting in extraction of the metal by simple aqueous washing. In essence, the method achieves maximum transformation of the original refractory mineral into a highly soluble solid salt during a step prior to the conventional leaching process.

However, in reality, there are frequently different electrode efficiencies at the anode and cathode. A higher anodic yield leads to an increase of the metal ion concentration. This can be found with certain electrolytes, such as nickel and zinc solutions. \n\nThere are options for dealing with this problem, which may be used alone or together. Problems are discussed under Applicability, below:\n\nwhere solution electrochemistry allows, use insoluble anodes with external dissolution of the metal and controlled solution strength (see introduction to Chapter 2, Electrolytic cells and reactions) \nreplace some of the soluble anodes by membrane anodes with an extra current circuit \nspecial insoluble anodes that allow the concentration of the solution to balanced \nrun workpieces or substrates requiring higher thickness coatings \n'plating out' on steel sheet\nremoving anodes.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMinimisation of energy usage and waste of process metal in drag-over.\nReduction of plating over the required specification thickness. \nReduction in environmental effects from reworking due to problems with over-plating.\n\nCross-media effects\nAdditional equipment is required where external dissolution tanks are used, or membrane circuits and/or separately controlled additional circuits.\n\nOperational data\nAll techniques may improve process control, but see Applicability. Use of external make-up tanks or process additions requires increased process quality control and maintenance.\n\nApplicability\nMany electrolytic processes, including zinc, can utilise insoluble electrodes and use external make-up tanks, or separate solution additions. An inert anode system with external make up requires additional investment but addresses the problem consistently over time. \n\nRunning workpieces or substrates requiring higher thickness coatings and 'plating out' on steel sheet, only works with soluble anodes. 'Current efficiency' may then become too high. The right balance of specifications for workpieces (i.e. combination of thicker and thinner coating thickness requirements) may not coincide with the need to remove excess dissolved metal, especially for jobbing shops.\n\nRemoving anodes: the anodic current density must be considered. This can lead to anode passivation and/or increased electrolytic decomposition of process solution constituents. The reduced current density reduces throughput and takes more time to reduce the process solution metal concentration.\n\nPlating out does not recover anode metal. However, electrolytic selective plating using low current densities can be used to remove unwanted contaminating metals, for example from nickel baths with soluble Ni anodes.\n\nIn practice, nickel processes cannot utilise insoluble electrodes (see Section 2.5.2)\n\n\nMembrane anodes are breakable, and it may not be possible to use this technique in sub-contract plating, where the shapes and sizes of parts to be plated vary continuously (and may make contact with and break membranes). Membrane anodes are also limited by current density. \n\nEconomics\nInvestment in an inert anode system with external make-up or using membrane anodes with a separate circuit is usually self-financing through materials saving and improved process quality. Other options are cheaper in the short term, but lack long-term consistency and savings, and if relied on regularly, may give more quality problems (and hence cost) than they resolve.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProcess economics.\nProcess uniformity over time and reduction in reworking.\n\nExample plants\nMetal Colours, Slough, UK.; SIKEL N.V.

However, in reality, there are frequently different electrode efficiencies at the anode and cathode. A higher anodic yield leads to an increase of the metal ion concentration. This can be found with certain electrolytes, such as nickel and zinc solutions. \n\nThere are options for dealing with this problem, which may be used alone or together. Problems are discussed under Applicability, below:\n\nwhere solution electrochemistry allows, use insoluble anodes with external dissolution of the metal and controlled solution strength (see introduction to Chapter 2, Electrolytic cells and reactions) \nreplace some of the soluble anodes by membrane anodes with an extra current circuit \nspecial insoluble anodes that allow the concentration of the solution to balanced \nrun workpieces or substrates requiring higher thickness coatings \n'plating out' on steel sheet\nremoving anodes.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMinimisation of energy usage and waste of process metal in drag-over.\nReduction of plating over the required specification thickness. \nReduction in environmental effects from reworking due to problems with over-plating.\n\nCross-media effects\nAdditional equipment is required where external dissolution tanks are used, or membrane circuits and/or separately controlled additional circuits.\n\nOperational data\nAll techniques may improve process control, but see Applicability. Use of external make-up tanks or process additions requires increased process quality control and maintenance.\n\nApplicability\nMany electrolytic processes, including zinc, can utilise insoluble electrodes and use external make-up tanks, or separate solution additions. An inert anode system with external make up requires additional investment but addresses the problem consistently over time. \n\nRunning workpieces or substrates requiring higher thickness coatings and 'plating out' on steel sheet, only works with soluble anodes. 'Current efficiency' may then become too high. The right balance of specifications for workpieces (i.e. combination of thicker and thinner coating thickness requirements) may not coincide with the need to remove excess dissolved metal, especially for jobbing shops.\n\nRemoving anodes: the anodic current density must be considered. This can lead to anode passivation and/or increased electrolytic decomposition of process solution constituents. The reduced current density reduces throughput and takes more time to reduce the process solution metal concentration.\n\nPlating out does not recover anode metal. However, electrolytic selective plating using low current densities can be used to remove unwanted contaminating metals, for example from nickel baths with soluble Ni anodes.\n\nIn practice, nickel processes cannot utilise insoluble electrodes (see Section 2.5.2)\n\n\nMembrane anodes are breakable, and it may not be possible to use this technique in sub-contract plating, where the shapes and sizes of parts to be plated vary continuously (and may make contact with and break membranes). Membrane anodes are also limited by current density. \n\nEconomics\nInvestment in an inert anode system with external make-up or using membrane anodes with a separate circuit is usually self-financing through materials saving and improved process quality. Other options are cheaper in the short term, but lack long-term consistency and savings, and if relied on regularly, may give more quality problems (and hence cost) than they resolve.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProcess economics.\nProcess uniformity over time and reduction in reworking.\n\nExample plants\nMetal Colours, Slough, UK.; SIKEL N.V.

At this point, the pickling bath is useless and is usually discarded. Further use of the pickling solution is possible only by selective separation of the dissolved metal salts. \n\nDiffusion dialysis separates acid from its metal contaminants via an acid concentration gradient between two solution compartments (contaminated acid and deionised water) that are divided by an anion exchange membrane, see Figure   4 .85. Acid is diffused across the membrane into the deionised water whereas metals are blocked due to their charge and the selectivity of the membrane. A key difference between diffusion dialysis and other membrane technologies such as electrodialysis or reverse osmosis is that diffusion dialysis does not employ an electrical potential or pressure across the membrane. Rather, the transport of acid is caused by the difference in acid concentration on either side of the membrane. As such, the energy requirements for this technology are low. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.85: Regeneration of pickling solutions by dialysis\n\n\nTable 4.58: Results of the dialysis treatment on etching solutions \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nExtension of service life of the chemical process solution. Achieved concentrations are shown in Table   4 .58.\nLower power consumption than techniques using pressure\n\nCross-media effects\nThe concentration of recovered acid will normally be lower than that of the feed acid, and make-up acid must be added to bring the concentration up to the process level. When the\nfeed has a significant salt concentration, the concentration of recovered acid can exceed the concentration of the feed acid.\n\nThe depleted acid waste stream (after diffusion dialysis processing) is approximately equal in volumetric flow to the waste acid influent. Depending on the application-specific acid removal and metals rejection rates, the depleted acid waste stream (retentate) typically contains 5 to 20 % of the acid and 60 to 95 % of the metals from the influent waste acid stream. This stream is usually sent to waste water treatment.\n\n\n\n\nOperational data\nTo prevent mechanical blocking, pickling acids must be pre-filtered before using dialysis. \n\nFor diffusion dialysis processing, an increase in membrane area per unit of acid flow increases the acid recovery rate. If the flowrate of DI water increases, the acid recycling rate increases and the recycled acid concentration decreases.\n\nDiffusion dialysis systems can be used for batch or continuous flow applications. Small systems are often configured as mobile units.\n\nLimitations in using diffusion dialysis to recover surface finishing process acids include:\n\nacids not highly dissociated (e.g., phosphoric acid) will not diffuse across the membrane\ncomplexed metal anions (e.g., fluorotitanium anions) can readily diffuse across the anion exchange membrane and are not efficiently separated from the acid.\n\nCooling is typically needed if influent waste acid temperature exceeds 50 degC.\n\nHeating may be needed for low temperature influent waste acid. A temperature drop of 2 degC reduces the acid recycling rate by approximately 1.5 %.\n\nSolvents can cause membrane swelling.\n\nStrong oxidising substances (e.g., chromic acid) can cause membrane deterioration.\n\nApplicability\nDiffusion dialysis is a purification/recycling technology that can be used to maintain or reclaim spent or contaminated acids where acid concentrations are greater than 3 % by weight. Diffusion dialysis is most typically used where contaminant metals concentrations are less than 1 gram per litre.

They can be separated after pH adjustment.\n\nUsed acid or alkali solutions are often treated separately as they create a large pH change which may not be accommodated by continuous flow waste water treatment plants.\n\nThe surfactants present are not usually eliminated by a typical waste water treatment plant. Cleaning solutions may need to be separated from other process effluents to avoid interference with the waste water treatment plant by excess surfactants.\n\nMaintenance can extend bath lives, see Section 4.11.13\n\nOperational data\nShort process solution life, depending on the throughput and the amount of oil and grease removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicability\nWater-based degreasing systems offer well proven alternatives to solvent-based systems in almost all cases. \n\nCleaning processes for zinc and aluminium must be at or near neutral pH. \n\nEmulsifying degreasing solutions have better degreasing efficiency, but are more difficult to regenerate than unstable emulsion (weak emulsion) systems.

When a polyol having a molecular weight of 1000 or less is used in combination with the aldonic acid and/or the salt of an aldonic acid, the polyol causes wetting and swelling of foulants.

By topping up of the consumed process chemicals the service lifetime of a solution can be extended, see Section 4.1.2. Statistical Process Control (SPC) controls are often used and/or other production management systems A key problem remains that some production operators tendency to add more material than is necessary.\n\nWhere possible, automated dosing is the best option for accuracy and reliability, and allows regular additions and avoids swings in concentration. This may be actuated on a time, temperature, flowrate, or other control basis, such as pH or rH, etc.\nExisting processes can be optimised by suppliers and/or in-house expertise to reduce the concentration of chemicals, particularly those with significant environmental or health effects.\n\nThere are two cases to differentiate between: \n\nMetals: the balance of the metal ions in electroplating is theoretically constant between the amount dissolved from the anode and the amount deposited at the cathode, but this is not true in practice, see Section 4.8.2. In the electroless deposition of a metal or with the use of inert anodes, the metal ions must be replaced in the solution according to their deposition rate and their drag-out. \n\nProcess chemicals: the concentration of other remaining chemicals in the process solution, such as acids, alkalis, salts, gloss additives/brighteners or buffer substances is reduced automatically by drag out of electrolyte or by degradation in the process.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nExtension of service life of solutions. \n\nReduction in over-use of chemicals through uncontrolled additions.\nCross-media effects\nNone\n\nOperational data\nMeasurement of key process solution components at preset intervals is necessary to monitor consumption, breakdown rates and additions made.\n\nThe consumption of the individual ingredients of the process solutions does not happen uniformly. Selected ingredients which are subject to a higher consumption need to be topped up separately. The selected dosage of components can be problematic where the individual material components are not known to the operator and not always available on the market. Chemical suppliers can assist with advising on control parameters and provide concentrates for topping up. The top up may have to be based on empirical investigations (operational experience) and can often only be automated with difficulty.\n\nApplicability\nAll process solutions.

Combined strategies may be more cost-effective, due to economy of scale, unless there are substantially increased plant interface requirements: for example, a typical waste water treatment plant is based on combining all the flows (see Sections 2.13.1 and 4.16).

This can be by prevention and retention of raw materials (for example, see Sections 4.6 and 4.7), electrolytes (see Section 4.11.9) and/or precipitation (see Section 4.16.7).

For example, a single mobile diffusion dialysis system might be used to purify/recycle several different acid baths. Combined strategies may be more cost-effective, due to economy of scale, unless there are substantially increased plant interface requirements: for example, a typical waste water treatment plant is based on combining all the flows (see Sections 2.13.1 and 4.16). Point source systems, in part or completely, may offer more flexibility, redundancy, reliability and may be more cost-effective. In some cases, techniques can be combined to achieve zero, or close to zero, discharge (see Section 4.16.12). \n\nExamples of combining techniques\nThere are several techniques that can be used to enable water to be re-used in processes and/or for the final cleaning of waste waters to meet low emission requirements, see Annexes 8.5 and 8.11. \n\nDescription\nThe final cleaning of waste waters by using chelating cation exchange resin is more efficient when carried out after effective metal removal. This can be by prevention and retention of raw materials (for example, see Sections 4.6 and 4.7), electrolytes (see Section 4.11.9) and/or precipitation (see Section 4.16.7). The efficiency of chelating cation exchange resin depends also on the effluent pH. The optimum pH is different for each metal.

High efficiency electrolytic cells increase the lifetime of the exchange resin.\n\nA combination of electrolysis and fluid bed technologies can be used on their own or in combination with semi-permeable membranes and ion-exchange technologies for the recovery of metals from polluted aqueous solutions, see Section 4.12.1(some of these are proprietary and patented).\n\nFigure 4.76: Removal of metal lost in rinsing prior to ion exchange\nChemelec cell, BEWT Environmental Services Ltd.\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAchieving low levels of metal discharged.\nPotential to re-use rinse-waters.\n\nIon exchange systems require space, not only for the resin columns but also for the regeneration plant.

In some cases, techniques can be combined to achieve zero, or close to zero, discharge (see Section 4.16.12). \n\nExamples of combining techniques\nThere are several techniques that can be used to enable water to be re-used in processes and/or for the final cleaning of waste waters to meet low emission requirements, see Annexes 8.5 and 8.11. \n\nDescription\nThe final cleaning of waste waters by using chelating cation exchange resin is more efficient when carried out after effective metal removal. This can be by prevention and retention of raw materials (for example, see Sections 4.6 and 4.7), electrolytes (see Section 4.11.9) and/or precipitation (see Section 4.16.7). The efficiency of chelating cation exchange resin depends also on the effluent pH. The optimum pH is different for each metal. [121, France, 2003].\n\nThe removal of the metal (for example, with electrolysis,) may be most easily achieved at the rinsing stages (see Figure   4 .76 Section 4.7), where it most concentrated and prior to mixing with any other contaminants. High efficiency electrolytic cells increase the lifetime of the exchange resin.\n\nA combination of electrolysis and fluid bed technologies can be used on their own or in combination with semi-permeable membranes and ion-exchange technologies for the recovery of metals from polluted aqueous solutions, see Section 4.12.1(some of these are proprietary and patented).\n\nFigure 4.76: Removal of metal lost in rinsing prior to ion exchange\nChemelec cell, BEWT Environmental Services Ltd.\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAchieving low levels of metal discharged.\nPotential to re-use rinse-waters.\n\nIon exchange systems require space, not only for the resin columns but also for the regeneration plant.

This replaces depleted solution at the surfaces and prevents the build-up of gas bubbles and contaminants at the workpiece or substrate surface, giving uneven finishes, pitting, etc. In barrel treatments, sufficient agitation is usually achieved by the turning of the barrels and movement of the workpieces within.\n\nAgitation of anodising solutions is essential to maintain a constant temperature in the bath and remove heat from the surface of the aluminium.\n\n\nThe options are:\n\ncompressed air through nozzles\nlow pressure air\nhydraulic turbulence\nagitation of the workpieces by moving the flight bars or rods by cams or motors.\n\nThe use of compressed air gives high evaporative heat losses, especially when used in conjunction with air extraction, see Section 4.4.3, as well as energy consumption by the compressor. However, the energy losses may be negligible when used in very small tanks.\n\n\nHydraulic turbulence is by a pumped system with eductor nozzles placed at the bottom of the tank. Although the energy required is greater than that needed for traditional air or cathode rod agitation, the energy loss through evaporation of water in air agitated tanks offsets the higher energy usage of hydraulic turbulence. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe energy consumption when using air agitated systems is considerable, see Section 4.4.3.\n\nCross-media effect\nAir agitation may create or exacerbate sprays, mists or fumes of airborne particles or droplets. These may contain chemicals harmful in the workplace and/or in the environment, if removed by extraction systems.\n\nCompressors for air agitation may be a source of noise.\nAir agitation can be the source of large energy losses, see Section 4.4.3\n\nOperational data\nHydraulic turbulence provides greater agitation than air systems. This results in improved plating quality, reduction of rejects, and optimisation of proprietary additives consumption.\n\nAll systems need to be operated at a level that is effective in moving the solution, but does not cause displacement of workpieces from jigs. Displaced parts left in the solution often cause contamination problems (see Section 4.11).\n\nApplicability\nAll process tanks requiring agitation.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCosts saved in energy consumption, improved process quality, improved workplace health and safety.\n\nExample plants\nBodycote, Uxbridge, UK (formally West Middlesex Plating)\n\nReference literature\n[3, CETS, 2002], [18, Tempany, 2002] [118, ESTAL, 2003].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3257702_abstract", "x": 0.39875314, "y": 0.7579586, "title": "MOVABLE CHARGING APPARATUS", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention provides a movable charging apparatus comprising a house, at least one storage portion and a plurality of movable units.

However, it is now under investigation (see Annex 8.2) and the OECD Task Force on Existing Chemicals has already agreed that it is persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic.\n\nNo substitutes for Nonyl Phenyl Ethoxylate (NPE) have been reported.\n\nSubstitutes are available and in use for anodising.\n\nThere are currently no substitutes for PFOS in Cr(VI) plating and pickling because of its strong resistance to oxidation. PFOS is also used in alkali cyanide-free zinc processes to reduce spray, as well as zonc alloy plating, some anodising and strong acid gold processes.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSubstitution by less harmful substances, or alternative processes will reduce the environmental and health effects.\n\nCross-media effects\nPFOS has important health and safety functions in controlling the spray from harmful solutions.\nIncreased extraction of Cr(VI) and other air pollutants due to cessation of use may require additional scrubbing and treatment.\n\nOperational data\nIn situations where PFOS has been used, such as Cr(VI) plating, other measures may be taken to prevent Cr(VI) mist reaching MAC levels in the workplace, such as use of floating insulation (see Section 4.4.3), lids on tanks and/or redesigned and/or upgraded ventilation (see Section 4.18.2), substitution by a less harmful process (see the appropriate parts of this section), etc.\n\nIf PFOS has to be used, then it is best practice to use it in a closed loop process.

In addition to rinse-waters, the following waste waters streams can also contain metals:\n\nused process solutions from the electrochemical processes (electrolytes) \nused process solutions from chemical coating processes \nused process solutions from the pre- and post-treatment (cleaning, pickling, phosphating and chemical conversion)\nsolutions from separation and regeneration processes, such as ion exchange, retardation, dialysis, electrolysis\nsolutions from associated activities, such as exhaust scrubbers and filters, as well as from plant cleaning.\n\nGenerally the solutions and effluents are discharged into the effluent system. The treatment of the streams containing metal in the system essentially precipitates the dissolved metal ions as insoluble compounds. Normal precipitation with caustic soda solution and/or lime precipitates the metals as hydroxides and/or oxide hydrates. Precipitation may also be as carbonates and sulphides. The sludge produced has a water content of usually over 95 % and is drained by means of filter presses to about 60 % water content and is disposed of in this form as sludge.\n\nThe amount of sludge depends on various processing factors: \n\ncontamination of the input material \namount of metal oxides dissolved or eroded from the workpiece/substrate surfaces \ndischarge of process solution dragged-out by the workpieces/substrate\nservice lifetime of the process solutions.\n\nThat means that the generation of sludge without internal recycling measures is directly proportional to the drag out and the service lives of the process solutions. Generally, the metal losses by drag out related to the metal input material lies between 5 and 30 %. \n\nSurface treatment sludge is usually a mixture of metal hydroxides. It contains all non-ferrous metals used during the process, the workpiece substrate metals iron and aluminium, as well as calcium, potassium and sodium from the precipitation chemicals. \nDepending on the plating process, the non-ferrous metal contents (Cu, Ni) can amount to up to 30 %, for example, with monosludges (i.e. sludges from one process type only).

This etching process is caused by a reaction between the aluminium and caustic soda that produces sodium aluminate and hydrogen gas:\n\nEtching reaction:\t2Al + 2NaOH - 2NaAlO2 + 3H2 (gas)\n\nThe etching process is typically responsible for 80  90 % of the aluminium in the waste treatment system.\n\nChemical stabilisers (complexing agents) are added to prevent the aluminium from precipitating out in the etch tank. Water is used to rinse the etching solution off the parts. The rinse-water carries dissolved aluminium and caustic to the plant waste treatment system.\n\nIf stabilisers are not used, the sodium aluminate concentration becomes too high and it will hydrolyse to produce alumina trihydrate (Al2O3 (H2O)3), liberating free caustic soda.\n\nHydrolysis reaction:\t2NaAlO2 + 4H2O - 2NaOH + Al2O3(H2O)3\n\nThis reaction, known as the Bayer process, is used in the primary aluminium industry to make alumina. If not properly controlled, it leads to an accumulation of a rock-hard aluminium hydroxide scale in the etch tank.\nA regeneration system recirculates the etch solution continuously between the etch tank and a separate crystalliser tank, where the etch solution is seeded with alumina crystals in a separate crystalliser tank. It is then possible to regenerate the etch solution without scale building up.\n\nThe hydrated alumina crystals formed in the crystalliser settle out in a settlement section. Regenerated etch solution, with reduced aluminium and increased free caustic levels, feeds back to the etch bath directly from the top of the crystalliser. Alumina crystals are withdrawn periodically from the bottom of the crystalliser and dewatered in a vacuum filter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRegeneration can reduce a plant's solid waste by over 80 % while lowering caustic chemical (and neutralisation) costs by over 70 %.\n\nThe removed alumina crystals may be used in a variety of alumina substitutes (however, this is dependant on quality, see Cross-media effects, below).\n\nCross-media effects\nIn some installations, to achieve a specific quality for specified products, additives may be added to the etching baths which generate impurities in the recovered alumina.

The gas flows through the column countercurrently to the liquid, thus extracting ammonia (stripping) in gas form. To enhance the liquid-gas contact, the columns are filled with specifically shaped pieces of inert material (packed column). The treated liquid is collected at the bottom of the tower and the ammonia-loaded gases leave the tower at the top, for further treatment. \n\nStripped ammonia is recovered by absorption in a second column (absorber), where the ammonia-laden gases are washed countercurrently with acid solution (e.g. sulphuric acid, iron sulphates, iron oxides) to dissolve ammonia and to produce a concentrated ammonium salt solution. In steam stripping, the output gas from the stripping tower is condensed to eventually produce a water solution of ammonia. The end product of the technology can be used as a fertiliser.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe removal of ammonia from the slurry results in a mitigation of potential ammonia emissions. During slurry landspreading, odours are also reduced. Nitrogen is recovered in a concentrated form as a salt or in a liquid solution, therefore nutrient management is easier and transport costs are reduced. \n\nCross-media effects\nEnergy consumption is increased. Depending on the working temperature, heating energy requirements may play a primary role in energy consumption .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe two fundamental control parameters of the process are the temperature and the pH, as they establish the equilibrium between ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+). The pH is usually set between 9 and 10, by adding an alkaline solution of soda or lime, or by previous CO2 stripping, so that ammonia can be released as a gas. For air stripping, typical working temperatures are set below 100 degC, whereas higher temperatures are characteristic of steam stripping. An ammonia reduction of up to 95 % is reported, under optimal conditions . Organic nitrogen, nitrites and nitrates are not removed. \nThe electricity consumption for air stripping is dependent on the process temperature, since, at higher temperatures, less air needs to be sent through the column. The consumption of electrical energy is reported from Belgium (Flanders) as 2.3 kWh/m3 of liquid, if the process is run at 20 degC, and 0.85 kWh/m3 if the operating temperature is 50 degC. The energy consumption for the stripping column only is reported as 14 kWh/kg of stripped nitrogen . In the case of steam stripping, the electricity consumption is 0.45 kWh/m3 liquid, while the consumption for thermal energy is equivalent to the production of 100 kg of steam per m3. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe quality of the ammonia salts or ammonia concentrate obtained increases when volatile organic matter has been previously removed. Therefore, mechanical separation of the solid-liquid fractions is usually required as a pretreatment, to reduce the dry matter content and avoid clogging.\n\nThe technique may be used in combination with anaerobic digestion, as a pretreatment that improves the ammonia stripping efficiency, reduces contamination of the final product by organic matter, and provides energy and heat required for the process. Due to the high heat demand, the technique may not be economically sustainable if heat from biogas production is not available [ 624, IRPP Technical Working Group (TWG) 2013].\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs are reported from Italy as EUR 350 000. For a plant located in Slovenia, treating 15 m3/h of slurry, the estimated investment cost for the stripping column was reported to be EUR 250 000. \n\nFor a mobile unit combining a centrifugal solid-liquid separator and ammonia stripping equipment, followed by a catalytic ammonia process, investment costs are reported to be in the range of EUR 350 000-400 000. The related operating costs are EUR (125  2) per m3 of treated slurry, for the displacement of the integrated mobile unit, EUR 3.10 per m3 for the separation stage, and EUR 4.46-4.95 per m3, for ammonia stripping plus the catalytic oxidation stage  .\n\nOperating costs have been reported as EUR 2.5-4.5 per kg of stripped nitrogen (only for the stripping column). For the absorption stage, at least an equivalent range of costs should be considered. In Denmark, ammonia stripping is considered disproportionately expensive . \n\nDriving force for implementation\nBoth liquid ammonia solution or solid ammonia salts obtained by condensation and evaporation can be used directly as fertilisers, as feedstock in the fertiliser industry or sold to other industrial applications (e.g. waste water treatment in the paper industry). The reported income is up to EUR 0.35 per kg of nitrogen recovered in a 0.1 ammonium sulphate solution, to be sold to fertiliser manufacturers. The end product concentrate (which contains phosphorus and nitrogen) is partially hygienised (depending on the operation time/temperature). \n\nExample plants\nIn Belgium (Flanders), a mobile system is in use.

Active ingredients from Oreganum vulgare, Piper Nigrum, Syzygium aromaticum, Thymus vulgaris, Yucca schidigera and Quillaja saponaria have proven effects on the stabilisation of animals' intestinal microflora. The specific effects are: \n\nan antagonistic activity to many subcultures of pathogenic enterobacteria, such as C. perfringens or E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, Y. enterocolitica or of S. aureus;\nimprovement of animal metabolism by increased blood circulation (pungent substances);\nreinforcement of the immune system, of the growth and reproductive performance by a better permeability of intestinal cell walls;\ninhibition of the activity of the urease enzyme and thus reduction of ammonia volatilisation (saponins). \n\nThe standardisation of the active ingredients and dosage recommendations of these additives are the basis for achieving reproducible results in animal nutrition. The leading substances are defined by product specification.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDue to the increased secretion of digestive juices, raw protein is increasingly digested in amino acids which are absorbed at a greater rate. Furthermore, animals achieve higher rates of growth, more raw protein is used for meat and, consequently, reduced amounts of excess protein are excreted through faeces .\n\nSaponins contained in the products reduce the activity of the urease enzyme, which is formed by bacteria in the large intestine and which decomposes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. The inhibition of activity leads to a lower production of ammonia.\n\nHowever, it is also reported that the consistent effectiveness on ammonia emissions remains unproven, resulting in uncertainty regarding their performance. The available experiment results report data concerning commercial products made from blends of different phytogenic substances. Data on the efficacy of each type and dose of the active compounds contained in the commercial products and their possible interactions with other feed ingredients are not yet available . \n\nCross-media effects\nNo cross-media effects have been reported.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn poultry, reductions of indoor ammonia concentrations from 14.4 % to 53.8 % (compared to untreated feed) have been reported, along with an improvement in feed conversion of 2 % and final body weight of 3.2 %  .\n\nIn another study for fattening pigs carried out in Austria, the effectiveness of a phytogenic feed additive on the reduction of gaseous emissions as well as the effects on animal performance were investigated in one trial. The results report the content of nitrogen (both total N and NH4-N) in the manure was reduced by 60 % compared to that excreted by pigs that are fed with untreated feed, and a consequent decrease in ammonia concentrations in houses of around 38 % and 34 % for odours . \n\nSimilar results have been reported for the addition of two similar phytogenic additives based on ethereal oils and saponins to the feed of fattening pigs, with a reduction in the ammonia concentration in the house in the range of 32-38 % . However, another investigation of fattening pigs in Denmark on the effect of an additive based on a comparable active compound did not show any significant effect on ammonia emissions .\n\nTests carried out on lactating sows and piglets indicate that body weight loss is decreased in sows fed with phytogenic additives compared to sows fed without supplementation.

Slurry is discharged by opening a valve in the main slurry pipe. A slight vacuum develops and allows for a thorough slurry removal, better than by gravity alone. A certain depth of slurry needs to be obtained before the system can operate properly to allow the vacuum to develop and empty more slurry. The pit can be emptied once or twice a week; the evacuation frequency depends on the capacity of the pit or channel and on the weight of the pigs in the pens above, i.e. the same pit is filled up faster by 100 kg pigs than 20 kg pigs. The frequency of emptying will determine the volume of the external slurry storage required  .\n\n\nFigure 4.91:\tVacuum system in case of a fully slatted floor\n\n\nThe exact area covered by each pipe outlet depends on the dimension of the pen. In general, for every 10-11 metres in length, one pipe outlet is placed to discharge the slurry contained over the corresponding surface. An excessive number of outlets might increase the leakage possibility. The pen area served by each outlet is not considered to affect the emptying capability, as the optimum height of slurry required for the system to work is considered to be the same regardless of the area covered. As a larger pen area will accommodate a proportionately larger number of pigs, the optimum height will not take longer to reach. An optimal slurry depth is approximately 800 mm, regardless of the number of days it takes to reach it. It should be noted that slurry can be removed at a shallower depth, the minimum being 500 mm; however, this does not allow a sufficient vacuum to develop and results in more slurry being left in the system. \n\nHigh-powered submersible pumps are also used for infrequent intensive cleaning (every 2 years) with high-pressure water to remove crusting from around the tank edges.

Less water is needed to clean the floor compared with partly slatted or solid concrete floors. It is suggested that any aerosols which develop during the discharge of the slurry are removed by the vacuum created when opening the valves. Because of the reduced storage period of the slurry inside the buildings, an additional capacity/volume of the external slurry store may be needed.\nThis technique can generate odour peaks at the time of emptying the slurry pits.

Forced ventilation is applied through tubes that blow 1.2 m3 of air per bird place per hour at a temperature of 17-20 degC (pullets and layers have different requirements) over the manure stored under the slats or over the manure being removed by the (aerated) belts .\n\n\nFigure 4.75:\tDeep litter systems with forced drying via tubes under the slatted floor\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe application of forced ventilation and the quick drying of the manure reduce ammonia emissions. Frequent removal with (aerated) manure belts can give even lower emission levels. Reduced odour levels can be expected. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe energy input in this system is high because a heating system must be installed to achieve the temperature necessary in the tubes (20 degC). Extra energy is also required to maintain the airflow. Air is drawn in through inlets in the side walls and though an open ridge construction in the roof. Aeration may trigger nitrification reactions that may result in an increased emission of N2O. In general, due to the dried manure, higher dust emissions are expected.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nManagement of this system is principally the same as for the reference deep litter design. Ammonia emissions of 0.125 kg NH3 per bird place per year are associated with this system in the Netherlands . The associated ammonia reduction is 60 % compared to the deep litter system (0.315 kg NH3 per bird place per year).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe system can only be used in laying hen houses with enough space underneath the slats. Traditionally the manure pit has a depth of 80 cm but when using this system it is necessary to add an extra 70 cm. The experience of farmers already using the deep floor system is that this type of system requires very little change to the traditional design.\n\nEconomics\nThe total cost for implementing this system in Belgium (Flanders) is EUR 32/bird place (VAT excluded), which corresponds to an extra cost of EUR 3.15/bird place in comparison with a conventional deep pit system (11 % higher). The additional energy requirements for the ventilation amount to EUR 0.17/ap/yr .\n\nExample plants\nIn the Netherlands, around 1 129 000 birds are housed in this type of system, about 3 % of the total Dutch laying hen population .

Multivalent cations (e.g. Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3) and/or polymer flocculants (e.g. polyacrylamide, chitosan) are added to the slurry in order to achieve particle aggregation. \n\nFlocculant agents aggregate suspended particles into larger particles whose size and other physical properties make them easy to separate from the liquid fraction. The addition is done in a small mixer tank, to achieve a satisfactory particle aggregation, before mechanical separation in a screw press, band filter, or decanter-centrifuge system. Prior to flocculation, a pretreatment step may be needed (e.g. by a filter belt press to remove 1-2 % of the dry matter content) in order to avoid the risk of clogging during the process and to lower the required consumption of chemicals. The aggregated clumps can be removed by sedimentation, filtration or flotation.\n\nA schematic representation of the coagulation-flocculation process is shown in Figure   4 .147.\n\n\nFigure 4.147:\tSchematic representation of a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment for slurry separation \nIf both additives are used, the multivalent ion is added first to the slurry. Several minutes of slow stirring are necessary to ensure homogeneous distribution of ions and dry matter and for charge neutralisation and coagulation to occur. Afterwards, the polymer is slowly added in small doses during vigorous stirring, followed by slow stirring, which is necessary for polymer bridging and patch flocculation to occur. The stirring conditions applied by the impeller (i.e. time and speed) have a large impact on the formation of the aggregates; too slow stirring causes the aggregates to be non-uniform and unstable with a low particle catchment, while too much stirring causes the aggregates to be destroyed .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe technique can significantly increase the efficiency of the separation of organic matter and nutrients in the solid fraction compared with other solid-liquid separation techniques. See also Section 4.12.2.1. The liquid fraction resulting from a mechanical separation treatment which is enhanced by chemical flocculation contains very low levels of phosphorus and has a low dry matter content (e.g. about 1 %) which allows a fast infiltration of slurry into soil after landspreading and, therefore, NH3 emissions to air are reduced.\n\nCross-media effects\nElectrical energy is needed to run the pretreatment (coagulation-flocculation), with associated indirect emissions. The environmental and health consequences of emission of flocculants to the environment, when applied to land, have not been fully investigated. The monomers of polyacrylamide (PAM), used in most slurry separation studies, can be toxic, and potentially carcinogenic. It has been shown that PAM degradation is rather limited in soil; it accumulates in the environment, does not degrade in the biogas production process, and easily dissolves in water, making it difficult to trace . \n\nOn the other hand, the results of a study carried out on separated slurry products report the risk to be minimal if a biological post-treatment is applied, since PAM is degraded in biological processes without acrylamide accumulation .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe characteristics of the treated fractions are shown in Table   4 .306, for typical pig slurry, in Denmark and in Finland.\n\n\nTable 4.306:\tGeneral characteristics of the incoming slurry and the produced fractions after a mechanical separation process including flocculation \n\n\nIn Denmark, the proportion of total nitrogen in the dry matter fraction after separation with flocculation and a screw press is equal to 27 %. The respective proportion of phosphorus is reported to be 55 % . In Finland, a flocculation-enhanced separation consisting of a belt filter and a screw press removes from the raw slurry almost 50 % of the nitrogen and more than 90 % of the phosphorus . Additional operational data from the Netherlands are also presented in Table   4 .302 (see Section 4.12.2.1).\n\nThe process is reported to be very sensitive to the polyacrylamide concentration; an increase from 120 mg/kg to 140 mg/kg is capable of almost tripling the total dry matter of the solid fraction, but increases the ammonia and organic contents. As a result, the use of a polyacrylamide concentration greater than 120 mg/kg is not recommended where further anaerobic treatment is required .\n\nEnergy consumption for the application of this pretreatment (coagulation-flocculation) in combination with sieve separation treatment is reported to be in the range of 0.7 kWh to 2.0 kWh per tonne of manure. In a combined system in Finland, consisting of a filter belt, flocculation and a screw press, the energy requirement is reportedly around 3 kWh per m3 of treated manure . Flocculation is often used in combination with screw presses.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique is generally applicable to all types of slurry. The use of polyacrylamide as a flocculant may not be applicable due to the risk of acrylamide formation.\n\nEconomics\nFrom Denmark, a cost of EUR 20 000 is reported for each tonne/hour of capacity, for the application of coagulation-flocculation in combination with a sieve separator, which means approximately EUR 140 000 for a system with a capacity of 7 tonnes per hour. The annual operating costs have been calculated as EUR 1.3 per treated tonne. From other sources, operating costs are reported as EUR 0.8 per tonne of input slurry, and the investment costs around EUR 50 000 . From Finland, the annual cost of polymers for flocculation is reported to be EUR 3 000 for treating 6 000 tonnes of slurry per year . The labour demand in Denmark is estimated at approximately 0.25 h per working day.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSedimentation and separation are enhanced. A higher efficiency of mechanical separation techniques is achieved by modification of the particle properties, especially for separating particles belonging to the smallest particle fraction. The sediment of the flocculation and the solids from the subsequent mechanical separation treatment can be dried or further separated (e.g. using a screw press) into a solid fraction that contains most of the phosphorus from the raw slurry. The costs of manure storage, transport and application are reduced, which are key factors in areas with intensive livestock production. See also Section 4.12.2.1.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is relatively well known and is widely used for waste water and sewage treatment. It is estimated that in 2009 there were between 30 and 40 units in operation in Denmark for the separation of slurry with chemical precipitation by coagulation-flocculation, most of which are for pig slurry. In 2013 in Finland, this technique was in use on two pig farms and one dairy farm. The technique is also applied in France and Spain. \n\nReference literature\n     \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3628937_abstract", "x": 0.74830246, "y": 0.3958853, "title": "AIR CLEANER", "year": 2020, "text": "An air cleaner is provided.

To control the composting process and to achieve a better quality final product, substances of plant origin can be added to raise the carbon content. The application of additives aims to increase the porosity and binding of the nitrogen, thereby avoiding emissions to air.\nPoultry manure can be mixed with green residues, preferably woody crushed residues, by avoiding moving, in proportions from 1 to 1 (and up to 3 to 1) in weight (manure/green residues). Pig manure or slurry (liquid or solid fraction) can also be blended with organic materials for composting.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDepending on the origin of the manure and the co-substrate (vegetal matter) that is co-composted, a dilution effect of the nitrogenised load by 30 % to 60 % can be obtained.\n\nCross-media effects\nNH3 emissions can be controlled by proper management of the process, on the basis of the C/N ratio; otherwise, they can be considerable. Greenhouse gas emissions are very likely to occur during composting (see also Section 4.12.4.1).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nA typical poultry manure composition is 18 % bedding material, 50 % droppings and 32 % water, even though generally this does not correspond to the ideal composition for composting. Poultry manure contains cellulose and nitrogen, but moisture and the C/N ratio are relatively low. A more favourable C/N ratio for composting is 25-30, which is achieved by adding green wastes. Regarding moisture, it is necessary to increase the level by adding water from an external supply. Indicative values of the C/N ratio for different materials are presented in Table   4 .312. \n\n\nTable 4.312:\tIndicative values of the C/N ratio for different materials\n\n\nIn one example, poultry manure was mixed with pine bark, at an excreta/bark ratio of 3/1 on a total weight basis. In a comparison with other kinds of auxiliary substances, the pine bark showed the best results for pH level, nitrogen volatilisation and carbon content (organic material). \n\nThe composting took place at a temperature of 55-60 degC. A minimum porosity of the manure/bark mixture was maintained to allow an adequate oxygen supply. The test on compost produced with the addition of pine bark showed an unchanged (70 %) organic matter content (on a Dry Matter (DM) basis) after 90 days. The nitrogen losses reached about 35 % (on a Dry Matter (DM) basis) at 90 days and increased by 1-2 % over the next 90 days. The pH at 90 days was below 8, and reached 7.5 at 180 days.\n\nIn another reported example, straw pig manures were co-composted with woody pig manures (containing wood chips or sawdust). The weight reduction was 24-30 % and the nitrogen reduction 35-50 %. The presence of straw allowed a temperature increase of 10-15 degC, in comparison with composting the sawdust manure alone, over the last 3 months of composting . \n\nThe maturation time for compost in a heap, after a co-composting treatment, is reported to be longer. In particular, a duration of 4 to 5 months is needed for maturation when manure is composted with wood waste, in comparison with 6 weeks of active composting when only solid manure is composted .\n\nThe composition of turkey manure composted with wood waste in a proportion of 1/1 in weight is shown in Table   4 .313.\n\n\nTable 4.313:\tComposition variation of turkey manure co-composted with green residues (ratio 1/1 in weight) \n\n\nData on energy consumption for the equipment used in composting and co-composting plants are presented in Table   4 .314. \n\n\nTable 4.314:\tEnergy consumption of equipment used in composting and co-composting plants\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSee also Section 4.12.4.1. The bark needs to be dried and ground before it can be added to the manure. Green residues can be pre-composted before their use.\n\nWhen co-composting is applied with wood waste, the necessary available area that composting normally needs should be multiplied by 1.5, in order to take into account the increased volume .\n\nEconomics\nSee Section 4.12.4.1.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSee also Section 4.12.4.1. Properly composted solid manure significantly reduces the volume of material to be transported and landspread and the amount of odour released. During composting, a high temperature is achieved and the product is stabilised and sanitised. \n\nComposting and co-composting allow the reduction of the quantity of nitrogen to be spread, at relatively low investment costs, where constraints to manure landspreading may exist and where local markets for alternatives to conventional fertilisers can be found. \n\nFarmers can participate in recovering compostable residues on behalf of the local community, offering an opportunity to solve problems of green waste locally.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is widely applied in Catalonia, Spain, where it is reported that there are 127 farm-scale plants and 21 medium-scale plants where organic materials are mixed with manure in aggregated composting activities . In general, across Europe, the technique is widespread, mainly at centralised plants where other organic wastes may be included for co-composting .\n\nReference literature\n    \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3431906_abstract", "x": 0.8458057, "y": 0.21752861, "title": "DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING SYSTEM, AND A REFRIGERATOR COMPRISING THE DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING SYSTEM", "year": 2019, "text": "A door opening and closing system (1) having a door (2) and a frame (3), such that one of the edge (4) of the door (2) is in mechanical coupling to one of the edge (5) of the frame (3) for closing or opening of the door (2), the door opening and closing system (1) comprising an arrangement of a first part (6) and a second part (7), the first part (6) is having a cavity (8), and the second part (7) is having a complimentary structure (9) with respect to the cavity (8), such that the complimentary structure (9)to is adapted to makes a fitting into the cavity (8) of the first part (6) when the second part (7) is mechanically coupled to the first part (6) to close the door (2), and the complimentary structure (9) is adapted to release from the fitting to open the door (2), wherein one of the parts (6, 7) is placed on the edge (4) of the door (2) and other part (6, 7) is on the edge (5) of the frame (3) which are in the mechanical coupling for closing or opening of the door (2).

An adequate separation distance between field heaps and surface and/or underground watercourses such as drains, boreholes, wells, surface waters and springs reduces the risk of any leachate from a heap running over the soil surface directly into a watercourse or flowing through the soil and transporting nutrients, faecal indicator organisms and oxygen-depleting pollutants to watercourses. \n\nTemporary field heaps should be located at different places each year; this procedure is mandatory in some Member States, e.g. France. Where clay soils prevail and heaps change location, no accumulation of harmful amounts of nutrients is expected and special measures do not need to be applied to the bottom of the heap. To prevent water from entering the manure heap, the accumulation of rainwater at the base of the heap needs to be avoided. \n\nFor field heaps that are made in the same place every year or for stockpiles located on soils with high water tables, solid impermeable floors are applied for the storage of solid manure to prevent water and soil pollution by leaching. Equipping the store with drains and/or applying a convenient slope on the floor and connecting the drains with a closed container allow the collection of liquid fractions and of any run-off caused by rainfall. For impermeable floors made of concrete with leachate collection facilities, further information is presented in Section 4.11.1.4.\n\nStorage areas away from sensitive receptors are preferred, and any advantage that can be taken of natural barriers, such as trees or height differences, should be exploited. Walls (wood, bricks or concrete) can also be erected to surround storage heaps. These can serve as windscreens, with the opening of the storage on the lee side of the prevailing wind direction.\n\nThe smaller the ratio between the emitting surface area and the volume of the manure heap, the lower the ammonia and odour emissions. In order to reduce the manure surface exposed to air, manure can be compacted or a three-sided wall store can be constructed to increase the height. \n\nCompacting solid manure when stored is a management option for reducing ammonia emissions to air. The high density achieved by compaction reduces the air transfer in the heap so that self-heating (i.e. passive composting) can be avoided. A high density may be also a consequence of a high water content and of a low content of bedding material like straw or wood chips \n. The air exchange in combination with the elevated heap temperature due to aerobic decomposition will promote losses of ammoniacal nitrogen .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nSiting temporary solid manure field heaps as far as possible from surface and/or underground watercourses reduces risks of pollution of soil and water by surface run-off. Benefits are likely to be greatest on medium/heavy soils where surface run-off risks are highest and field drains are likely to be present. The direct loss of pollutants in surface run-off and drain flow is prevented if the storage of solid manure takes place on an impermeable base with leachate collection.\n\nMicrobial pathogen emissions during landspreading are reduced compared with fresh manure applications (i.e. immediately after removal from housing). Reducing the ratio between the emitting surface area and the volume of the manure heap can reduce ammonia losses to air. \n\nCross-media effects \nIf the heaps are uncovered or not covered completely or compacted to reduce air transfer, then composting (self-heating) may occur. In this case, ammonia emissions will increase with the increasing heap temperature  .\n\nNitrous oxide emissions may rise when increasing the manure density, due to the stimulation of nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification by an increased number and volume of sites with relatively low oxygen availability  .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data \nIn Finland, the heap must be at least 100 m from watercourses, main ditches, or from a well from which water is drawn for household use, and 5 m from (small) ditches . In the UK, the applied distances are 10 m from watercourses and 50 m from springs, wells, boreholes or other sources of water intended for human consumption . In France, the minimum distance from watercourses is reported to be 100 m . In Belgium (Wallonia), the dry farmyard manure has to be stored at least 20 m from any drain, well or surface water. In Ireland, the national legislation implementing the Nitrates Directive demands the heap to be placed within 250 m of an abstraction point, 50 m of any borehole, spring or well used for abstraction of water for human consumption, 20 m of a lake, 50 m of exposed cavernous or karst limestone features, 10 m of any surface water. In Italy, temporary manure storage is not permitted within a distance of 5 m from drains, 30 m from river sides, and 40 m from the bank of lakes, as well as from the coastline .\n\nAdditional requirements in Member States for temporary field heaps are presented in Table   2 .43. Microbial pathogen numbers decline during solid manure storage, with the rate of decline accelerated if self-heating (i.e. passive composting) occurs in the heap; this happens naturally in most FYM and poultry litter heaps. Hence, there are fewer microbial pathogens in the manure when it is spread and therefore less risk of microbial pathogens in surface run-off and drain flow. Storage is effective at reducing bacterial numbers, but is less effective at reducing populations of the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium .\n\nThe effect of temperature in solid manure heaps is significant and is related to the porosity, air permeability and water content of the heap because temperature is related to aerobic microbial activity. The heap temperature declines with an increasing heap density . \n\nOn the basis of experimental data, the following algorithms have been proposed to calculate ammonia emission factors in relation to the heap density: F(D) = 6.5 - 7.6*D. F(D) is an ammonia emission factor given as ln (% of Total Ammoniacal Nitrogen (TAN)) in manure and D is the heap density in kg/m3. The algorithm reflects that the NH3 emission declines exponentially with an increasing heap density . \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nThe storage of solid manure on an impermeable base equipped with a drainage system and a collection tank for the run-off is generally applicable. The storage of solid manure in field heaps placed away from surface and/or underground watercourses is only applicable to temporary field heaps which change location each year.\n\nEconomics\nCosts based on the construction of a concrete floor and leachate collection facilities and the associated areas for vehicle movements (amortised over 20 years) in the UK are reported as EUR 1.15/tonne of solid manure (EUR 1 = GBP 0.87). \n\nDriving force for implementation \nWhere field heaps can be used for batch storage prior to landspreading, siting solid manure field heaps away from watercourses and field drains is simple to implement.\n\nExample plants \nThe techniques for solid manure storage in heaps in the field are commonly applied. \n\nReference literature\n      \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3181523_abstract", "x": 0.62139297, "y": 0.25967777, "title": "METHOD FOR BOOSTING BIOMASS PROCESS", "year": 2017, "text": "In a method for boosting biogas process (1) digestion residue (2A) is dried mechanically (3) and binding matter, such as dried granulated or crushed biomass, is mixed (2B, 16, 4) with it as need for starting biological drying (6) in the mixture (5) and for raising its temperature to the target range 40 - 50 \u00b0C, the mixture is fed (7) for aerobic granulation and carbonising into a drum (8) or equivalent means in which the temperature of the mixture is by means of thermophilic microbial activity raised to the range 60 - 80 \u00b0C for elevating the dry matter content of the produced granules (11) to 60 - 80 percent, and at least 50 percent of the produced granules are recirculated back to be mixed as binding matter (13) to the digestion residue and / or as input material (14) to the biogas process (1).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.12.13\" title=\"Slurry and wet manure belt dryer\">\n<references_to>4.12.2.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nSlurry and wet manure belt dryer\n\nDescription\nThis technique is used to dry the non-stackable solid fraction that is obtained in mechanical slurry separation processes, the solid residue produced from biogas plants, or the non-separated slurry mixed with dried manure. It aims at a product with a reduced volume and higher dry matter content by using heat convection for drying. The input material is dried by means of a belt through which warm air flows.\n\nThe transport belts are made of wire material or perforated steel plates, and heated air flows through them. In drying chambers, one or several transport belts are arranged one above the other (see Figure   4 .157), allowing matter to drop from each. \n\n\nFigure 4.157:\tScheme of a manure belt dryer\n\n\nWhen the material reaches the lower belt, it is mixed and homogenised. The lowest degree of air turbulence and the optimal vapour content are sought, in order to minimise dust and to maximise moisture removal.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRelatively solid matter is processed into a dry, stable product that is suitable for storage and transportation and that develops no, or only slight, odour. The technique is commonly used in combination with biogas production and also in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe exhaust drying air can contain high levels of ammonia and so needs to be cleaned by an acid scrubber. The ammonium salt produced is removed from the scrubber with the discharge water and has a fertilising value (6-7 % of nitrogen in ammonium sulphate solution). In the scrubber, 8-12 kg of sulphuric acid are needed per tonne of digestate.\n\nSpecific thermal energy consumption of 700 kWh per tonne of solid matter is required to heat up the drying air, which is available on-farm at no additional cost when a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system is used to burn the biogas. Additional electric energy is needed to run the belt system, about 2-5 kWh per tonne of raw slurry, before separation. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nEquipment is available with a capacity of 1-2 tonnes per hour of separated solid fraction (corresponding to 5-10 tonnes per hour of raw slurry, before separation). An example of the input/output characteristics of manure processed with a belt dryer is presented in Table   4 .324. \n\n\nTable 4.324:\tInput and output characteristics of the manure processed in the manure belt drying process\n\n\nIt is assumed that around 90 % of NH4-N is extracted from the treated matter during the drying process, which corresponds to 0.30 kg of nitrogen per tonne, or to 0.66 % of the total nitrogen load. When the technique is combined with an acid scrubber, almost all the ammoniacal nitrogen would be collected; otherwise it would be lost as emissions.\n\nThe solid fraction obtained after separation is stabilised and reduced in volume. Non-separated slurry can be dried by mixing it with previously dried material. From a treated digestate, a solid mass is obtained having 8-9 % of the original volume, which is also sanitised of most pathogens.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nOnly slight adaptation to the farm equipment is necessary, since only a screw press separator (see Section 4.12.2.2) is required for raw slurry for the first slurry separation stage. The technique is preferably used in farms with over 2 000 animal places, or in combination with biogas production, to dry the fermentation residues by using the heat from Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs for drying units are reported from Germany to be in the range between EUR 300 000 and EUR 400 000 per unit, which corresponds to EUR 80 000-120 000 per tonne per hour. With an amortisation period of 10 years and 6 % interest rate, the investment can be annualised as EUR 10 000-15 600 per tonne, or EUR 39 000-52 000 per year, per drying unit.\n\nA complete installation for biogas digestate, inclusive of building and stores, costs about EUR 700 000 in Italy. Annualised investment costs are reported as EUR 3-4 per tonne of dried material produced, while annual operating costs are reported from Italy to range between EUR 0.8 and EUR 1.5 per tonne of dried digestate produced.

Part of the floor is elevated and has a slatted floor under which the manure pit is situated. At least one third of the available area has to be a littered floor. Ammonia emissions are reduced by the aeration of the manure collected in the pit with air from an air mixing cabinet or a heat exchanger. The pipes through which the air is blown are situated underneath the slatted floor and can be placed horizontally or vertically. \n\nIn the horizontal version, the pipes are installed under the slatted floor parallel to the laying nests and can be moved vertically according to the manure level in such a way that the vertical distance between the pipes and the manure is always close to 20 cm. Alternatively, the aerating tubes can be installed vertically under the slatted floor (see Figure   4 .87). The functional areas for feeding, drinking and resting are arranged above the slatted floor. \n\n\nFigure 4.87:\tCross section of system with forced air drying by vertical tubes \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSee Section 4.6.2.1.3.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe system with the horizontally placed tubes implies additional energy consumption, depending on the air temperature and the amount of forced air used for drying the manure.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe maximum animal density is restricted to 7-8 animals per m2, including roosters. The volume of air blown over the manure by horizontal pipes is reported to be 2.5 m3 per bird per hour, at a minimum temperature of 24 degC; while 50 % of the inlet air comes from outside the house (fresh air).\n\nThe tubes installed vertically are robust. They blow air through small holes at a minimum rate of 1 m3 per hour per animal. At least 50 % of the used air comes from outside and is heated to a minimum temperature of 20 degC.\n\nAmmonia emissions have been reported for the version with horizontal pipes ranging from 0.183 kg/ap/yr to 0.287 kg/ap/yr, and from 0.343 kg/ap/yr to 0.528 kg/ap/yr for the version with vertical pipes. The reported average values for ammonia emissions for the vertical configuration of pipes (0.435 kg NH3/ap/yr) and for the horizontal configuration (0.25 kg NH3/ap/yr) are, respectively, 57 % and 25 % lower than the emissions associated with the reference housing system in the Netherlands, consisting of a traditional deep litter system (0.580 kg NH3/ap/yr). \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSee Section 4.6.2.1.3.\n\nEconomics\nCost data concerning deep litter systems with manure pit aeration for both configurations, with horizontal and vertical pipes, are presented in Table   4 .196.\n\n\nTable 4.196:\tCost data for deep litter systems equipped with manure pit aeration through pipes\n\n\nData concerning extra investment and operating costs, in comparison with a reference traditional deep litter system, are also reported from the Netherlands and presented in Table   4 .197.\n\n\nTable 4.197:\tExtra costs for manure pit aeration through pipes (in case of deep litter systems), in comparison with a reference system \n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSee Section 4.6.2.1.3.\n\nExample plants\nIn Belgium (Flanders), 10 housing systems are using the technique, including farms above and below the IED capacity threshold .

Circulating fans do not necessarily decrease their net energy consumption when they direct warm air to litter.\n\nIn the Netherlands, circulating fans in vertical shafts are integrated into litter-based housing systems to reduce ammonia emissions by drying the litter. Details on this technique are given in Section 4.6.4.2.1.\nCross-media effects\nDust problems may arise.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nCirculating fans are placed at approximately 1 m above the litter and achieve air speeds of at least 0.8 m/s to every point of the living area, given that the recommended air speed is 1 m/s. According to the climatic conditions, 8 to 12 circulating fans with a capacity of 15 000-20 000 m3/h are needed for every 1 000 m2 .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nCirculating fans cannot be installed where there are many obstacles in the buildings that could affect their efficiency or where the movement of people or nearby receptors may limit their use. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nDepending on the price of electricity, economic savings in heating may be higher than the costs induced by the electricity consumption of circulating fans.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs for the installation of vertical circulating fans with a capacity of 20 000 m3/h at 15-metre intervals along the length of the house and 2-metre intervals along the width are estimated at EUR 5/m2 .\n\nExample plants\nIn France, 10 % of poultry buildings are equipped with circulating fans.\n\nReference literature\n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3511310_abstract", "x": 0.6291756, "y": 0.259993, "title": "DEVICE AND METHOD FOR INCREASING THE CONTENT OF METHANE IN A CURRENT OF BIOGAS BY MEANS OF A LOW-PRESSURE AIRLIFT SYSTEM", "year": 2019, "text": "Device for increasing the content of methane (CH4) in a current of biogas, comprising an airlift system body through which a water flow passes, an absorption column provided in the airlift system body, where the water flow absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrosulfuric acid (H2S) contained in the biogas, biogas injection means arranged in the lower part of the absorption column, means for recovering biogas with increased methane (CH4) content arranged in the upper part of the absorption column, and means for propulsion of the water flow.

The controlled degradation of the organic matter, without oxygen, is influenced by the pH value and temperature. The main components of biogas are methane (50-70 %) and carbon dioxide (40-50 %) depending on the substrate used. Other minor components are: H2S, H2O, NH3 and N2O. The higher the methane content, the richer in energy is the gas. Biogas production strongly depends on the type of biomass feedstock used in the process. During anaerobic decomposition, four biochemical processes are distinguished: hydrolysis, acidogenesis (fermentation), acetogenesis and methanogenesis.\nThe produced biogas is collected and can be used to produce heat, i.e. hot water in a boiler, combined electricity and heat in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, or it can be used as an alternative fuel in vehicles or as a substitute for natural gas after upgrading to biomethane. Some of the heat generated may be recycled in the process. \n\nAnaerobic digestion of slurry generates a slurry-like digestate. Solid poultry and pig manure or the solid fraction from mechanically separated slurry can be co-digested with slurry and other organic co-substrates in wet digestion. The stabilised residue (i.e. digestate) can be landspread as a soil conditioner and source of nutrients (see also Section 2.7.4). Composting is an option before landspreading of digestate in the case of sufficiently solid digestate. An example of a biogas installation following anaerobic treatment of manure is presented in Figure   4 .151.\n\n\nFigure 4.151:\tExample of biogas installation, following anaerobic treatment of manure, located in Denmark \n\n\nThe requirements for plants producing biogas using animal by-products (including manure) are specified in Regulation (EC) 142/2011 (e.g. hygiene requirements, equipment, location and other parameters).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nEnvironmental benefits (direct and indirect) of the process of anaerobic digestion, with energy recovery from the produced biogas, are as follows: \n\nReduction of CH4 emissions, which would otherwise have been emitted from the outdoor storage of untreated slurry. \nSubstitution of fossil fuel consumption by electricity and/or heat produced by power-heat biogas cogeneration and/or by biomethane produced from biogas, avoiding associated indirect greenhouse gas emissions. \nReduction of NH3 emissions at landspreading compared to untreated manure; since the digestate is more homogenous and spreadable, it can seep more easily and evenly into the crop root area, enabling better nutrient uptake by crops. \nImproved bio-availability of nitrogen, leading to decreased use of mineral fertilisers. Anaerobic digestion does not change the overall N/P ratio but converts part of the organic nitrogen into ammonium, which is readily available for the crops. This results in an increased concentration of ammonium in digested slurry, up to 30 % depending on the manure digested, compared to untreated slurry. Due to the higher NH4-N content of the digestate, overall ammonia emissions are reduced provided the digestate storages are covered and the digestate is spread with low-emission methods.\nReduction of pathogens in digested manure (higher in a thermophilic range).\nReduction of odour emissions. The odour from digestate is not as strong and pungent as from untreated slurry, and it also disappears faster from a fertilised field, partly because the digested slurry percolates faster into the soil due to its lower Dry Matter (DM) content, lower particle size and viscosity.\nSubstantial reduction of COD and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), due to organic matter breakdown.\nSlurry can also be mechanically separated at the farm with only the solid fraction transported to a centralised biogas plant for digestion. A study reports that the associated environmental benefits in comparison with slurry landspreading without any prior treatment are dependent on the efficiency of the separation technology used. The separation of volatile solids (biodegradable carbon) should be as high as possible; a polymer addition may increase the efficiency. In addition, the solid fraction should be transported directly to the plant and immediately fed into the digester. If storage is needed, it should be short and in covered storages to minimise emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases  \n.\n\nIn all biogas plants digesting manure, the digestate directly from the digester is still biologically active and contains degradable organic matter, the degradation of which continues in the vessel into which the digestate is directed. This vessel should be made into a gas-tight post-digestion tank which collects the biogas still produced. With energy use of this post-biogas in conjunction with the biogas from the digester, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be obtained .\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions of unburnt biogas through the biogas motor/engine are around 2 % but can be up to 4 % from older technology engines. Leakages of biogas (e.g. from the anchoring points of the meters) can lead to significant emissions of CH4 and other biogas components (NH3, H2S, etc.). Such emissions are known to vary significantly with equipment quality and the standard of maintenance. Best practice should aim to minimise fugitive methane emissions, since the operational efficiency of the digestion process will also be enhanced, thus maximising the production of energy . Including emissions during storage, total methane emissions of 6 kg CH4 per tonne of pig slurry, or 4-6 tonnes CH4 per tonne of poultry manure are reported from Belgium (Flanders).\n\nIn general, anaerobically digested slurry has a larger share of total N in the form of NH4-N. The higher content of NH4-N, in combination with the increased pH of the digested slurry, can lead to higher ammonia losses from storage and/or landspreading, compared with raw slurries. Due to the reduced content of organic matter, a natural crust is seldom formed on top of the liquid when it is stored in tanks, leading to a higher potential for emissions to air . Ammonia emissions from storage of the digested slurry can be high and stores should be covered and/or slurry immediately cooled, although losses during landspreading are reported to be lower than for untreated slurry . These effects may counterbalance the positive effect of a faster infiltration to the soil, so overall losses may be similar with untreated slurry after surface application.\n\nA high level of technical knowledge is needed on-farm to manage the whole process.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn general, digesters operate with a maximum dry matter content of 12 %, and at a constant temperature (with up to 2 degC variation) of 30-45 degC (mesophilic) or 52-55 degC (thermophilic, with an accepted temperature variation of only 0.5 degC). Plants operating at mesophilic temperatures are therefore easier to run, so most farm-scale plants, as well as many centralised plants, are of this type. \n\nThe process of mesophilic anaerobic digestion takes place in large digestion tanks, in one or two stages, and the hydraulic retention time is 15-40 days. Propellers are normally installed in the digestion tanks to ensure the digestate remains homogeneous and gives a maximum release of biogas. In the case of thermophilic digestion, the digester is heated to 55 degC and digestion takes 12-14 days. However, the technology is more expensive, since more energy and more sophisticated control instrumentation are needed. The advantages of thermophilic plants are higher levels of biogas production, faster throughput, improved hygienisation of the digestate, and lower viscosity during the process, facilitating mixing .\n\nVery short retention times decrease the level of degradation and thus may result in higher emissions later in the management of the digestate . The condition necessary for the successful formation of methane is a minimum water content of 50 % in the initial substrate .\n\nThe biogas production potential depends largely on the type of manure. Around 14-25 m3 of biogas production per m3 of slurry may be obtained (or even higher when pig slurry is digested), containing around 60-65 % methane. Calculations for biogas plants in Denmark show an average production of 22 m3 of biogas per tonne of pig slurry containing 6 % dry matter (on average) .\n\nIn order to maintain digestion, part of the heat produced during Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production is used to maintain the temperature of the biogas plant. About a third of the heat produced from such combined heat and power (Combined Heat and Power (CHP)) units is typically used for the anaerobic digestion process itself \n. This amount depends on scale and configuration. Net biogas power production is reported as 2.5 kWh per m3 of biogas and net biogas heat production as 2.0 kWh per m3 of biogas (after own use of heat and power in the process) .\n\nTo reach the required temperature, manure may be warmed up using part of the produced biogas or by heat exchange with the water cooling the gas engines. In farm-scale applications, heating of the manure is not always applied. The required parasitic energy load to maintain the digester is estimated to be around 5-20 % of the gross energy production of the installation, depending on the scale and configuration. The use of 20-25 m3 of biogas in the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant can produce 35 kWh to 40 kWh of electricity and 55 kWh to 75 kWh of heat energy . \n\nFrom Germany, net biogas power production is reported to be 2.5 kWh per m3 of biogas, and, 2.0 kWh per m3 of biogas as net heat production (after own use of heat and power in the process) . The resource efficiency of a combined heat and power (Combined Heat and Power (CHP)) system is about 35 % for the electrical production, or about 85 % if all the produced heat is recovered . \n\nThe biogas is stored in a gas buffer before being used in a heater or a gas engine. Before the biogas can be used, sulphur must be removed by a biological, adsorptive (active coal or ferro-chloride) or chemical technique (quenching) in larger installations, in order to protect the gas engine. A double membrane cover system is used to collect a quantity of biogas from the heated slurry digestate storage tank during the cooling phase of a continuous digester \n.\n\nDue to the general manure management required by the anaerobic digester, it is estimated that total farm emissions in Finland are reduced by 40 % for ammonia, while odour and methane are reduced by 80 % . N2O emissions associated with anaerobic digestion are reported to be negligible, compared to the overall annual N2O emissions from the farm.\n\nSince only a small proportion of the total manure mass is decomposed in a sealed anaerobic digester, the total content of nutrients in the digested manure does not differ much from raw slurries. However, data show a reduction in the slurry dry matter content of around 25 % between raw and digested slurries. The organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus are converted into water-soluble and readily available NE4-N and phosphorus. Digested manures show a 10-30 % higher proportion of NE4-N. \n\nCalculations made for the quantification of avoided greenhouse gas emission, as a result of fossil fuel substitution with biogas, show that the CO2-neutral energy produced by the biogas process saves 2 kg CO2 equivalent emissions per m3 of biogas. In addition, model calculations applied in Denmark show a reduction of naturally developed greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide) of approximately 1.2 kg CO2 equivalent per m3 of biogas. In total, a potential of 3.2 kg CO2 equivalent reduction in greenhouse gases emissions per m3 of biogas are estimated .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThis technique may not be generally applicable due to the high implementation cost. There are no technical restrictions to its on-farm application. The cost efficiency is likely to increase with an increasing volume of fermented manure. The minimum farm size according to the literature (see Reference literature below) is 50 Livestock Units (LU) .\n\nThe biogas production capacity of pig slurry is relatively low; hence, it often requires the addition of a proper co-substrate to increase efficiency. Possible sources of such substances are energy plants, green wastes, sewage sludge, and food residues . For this reason, in France, Denmark and Spain, biogas production is not considered technically and economically viable with only slurry as a substrate . In Spain, a slurry biodigestion plan has been developed, with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in the livestock sector. \n\nEconomics\nThe economics of anaerobic digestion systems are highly site-specific and depend on factors such as land and labour costs, effluent discharge regulations, and prices for energy produced by other sources. Where government incentives include a premium price for the electricity produced and in the case of environmental pressures that force farmers and related industries to consider alternative means to manage manure and organic wastes, the technique with associated biogas production can be economically viable. \n\nA reported example from Finland of a farm with 263 places for farrowing sows and 784 places for weaners indicates an investment of EUR 3 536 per animal place and an operating cost of EUR 40 per animal place per year. The annualised costs are given as EUR 656 per animal place. Electricity generated on-farm is reported to be 453 000 kWh and the produced heat 700 000 kWh (equivalent to 77 000 litres of fuel oil), allowing the farm to be self-sufficient in heat and electricity .\n\nAn example of a biogas plant for a small-scale farm is reported from Denmark, where pig slurry alone is used as a substrate for biogas production. The farm has a capacity equivalent to 2 950 fattening pig places (> 30 kg) and 500 sow places. Operational data and costs associated with the production of biogas are presented in Table   4 .315.\n\n\nTable 4.315:\tOperational and cost data for a biogas plant applied on a small-scale farm, operating with pig slurry only\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nHigh investment and operating costs are a major deterrent for the implementation of this technique; therefore, the availability of grants and high renewable energy prices would be needed to motivate the implementation of on-farm anaerobic digestion facilities . For this reason, in some Member States, the use of biogas in connection with the covering of the pig slurry stores is stimulated by financial incentives (e.g. Italy, France, Germany and Spain). \n\nFarms can achieve self-sufficiency in electricity . The heat produced by cogeneration of heat and power can also be transferred to external users for residential district heating and commercial heating requirements. \n\nEnvironmental policy targets for renewable energy, together with uncertainty about oil prices, may encourage the use of this technique. Co-processing with animal wastes from the food and meat industry may increase due to the increased costs of disposal brought about by the Animal By-products (Animal By-products (ABP)) Regulations .\n\nExample plants\nCentralised manure co-digestion installations where manure and/or energy crops and organic biological waste are used as inputs are common. In 2011, there were 180 anaerobic digesters in the Netherlands and 23 in agricultural areas of Belgium (Flanders). Around 30 farm-scale digesters are located in the UK and 3 in Belgium (Flanders). A biogas plant in Austria has been reported to be in operation since 1995. In 2003, in Italy about 50 low-cost digesters were installed, using gas which develops under the covers on slurry storage operating at low temperatures. \n\nFor the Baltic Sea region, the number of existing biogas plants for manure digestion and the amount of manure digested (estimated for the year 2012) are presented in the following table.\n\n\nTable 4.316:\tNumber of existing biogas plants for manure digestion and the amount of manure digested in the Baltic Sea region countries (estimated for year 2012)\n\n\nAn example plant is reported from Austria (Hirnsdorf) where a farm-scale biogas plant is loaded with pig slurry and other materials (laying hen manure or wastes). The biogas reactor has a volume of 750 m3 and treats around 4 500 m3 of substrate every year in bimonthly batches (the residence time is 50-60 days on average). The gas that is produced is desulphurised and fed to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant made up of two engines, with a maximum electrical power of 2 x 57 kW. Excess gas is stored in a dry gas silo reservoir. The electricity produced supplies the farm's own requirements and the excess power is fed into the public grid (between 2 000 kWh and 6 000 kWh per month). However, for the in-farm peak demands, external power has to be bought. The waste heat from the process is recovered and used in winter to heat the sorting hall and the pig houses, as well as to fully condition the gas reactor itself. From March to September, the heat is also used to feed the maize-drying facility in the continuous flow dryer system.\n\nReference literature\n        \n           \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3639916_abstract", "x": 0.67437685, "y": 0.35193995, "title": "METHOD AND FLUIDIZED BED GRANULATOR FOR THE PRODUCTION OF GRANULES FROM A SLURRY", "year": 2020, "text": "The current invention relates to a method for granulating a slurry in a fluidized bed granulator having a main longitudinal direction from a seed end where granulation is initiated, to a product discharge end where granules are discharged from the fluidized bed granulator, comprising at least one fluidized bed compartment, an injection section and a granulation section, separated by a bottom plate comprising one or more injection nozzles, wherein a feed slurry is provided to the injection section of the fluidized bed granulator, wherein a first fraction of the feed slurry provided to the injection section is injected into the granulation section through the one or more injection nozzles and a second fraction of the feed slurry, being the remainder of the feed slurry, is passed through the injection section without being injected into the granulation section The current invention also concerns a fluidized bed granulator, in particular for the granulation of slurries, more particularly for fertilizer products such as UAS according to the method of the invention.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.7.2.2\" title=\"Vacuum system for frequent slurry removal (in case of a fully slatted floor)\">\n<references_to>4.7.1.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nVacuum system for frequent slurry removal (in case of a fully slatted floor)\n\nDescription\nSee also Section 4.7.1.2.

In the IRPP sector, solid manure, mixed or not with vegetal organic matter, is used in the process. Aerobic conditions can be achieved by mechanically turning or mixing a heap or pile with a tractor loader, for example, to incorporate air or by more specialised equipment. \n\nThe aim of the technique is to facilitate naturally occurring microflora to degrade cellulose and other carbon compounds in the manure to produce a material that is friable and sufficiently stable for storage and transport and that has a reduced volume. Compost, which is the final product, consists of stabilised organic matter, has a low moisture content and retains most of the initial nutrients. \n\nIn the initial phase of the process (decomposition), exothermic reactions produce a temperature increase in the composting matrix, above 50 degC in the thermophilic temperature range up to 70 degC, with consequent hygienisation of the product by the elimination of pathogens in the manure. Aerobic conditions are needed in order to enable the microorganisms to convert the input material by using the available nutrients, oxygen and water. When oxygen is depleted, manure heaps cool down and aeration should be restored by mechanical turning of the heap, as well as by forced aeration .\n\nIn a second, curing, stage, complex organic matter is degraded and humic and fulvic acids are produced. The temperature slowly decreases in the mesophilic temperature range (below 40 degC) to room temperature. The whole process lasts between 8 and 16 weeks. Run-off liquids are collected by shafts and pumped to a tank, from where they can be recycled on the composting silo or windrow .\n\nThe different composting systems are described below.\n\nComposting with mechanical reversal of heaps\nOn farm, the manure is usually arranged in windrows (long heaps with a trapezoidal or triangular section, typically 1-3 metres high, 2-5 metres wide and of indeterminate length) and monitored for temperature and moisture. The temperature needs close monitoring, especially during the first days. Run-off waters or slurry can also be added to increase moisture. The windrows are turned over and mixed periodically using conventional loading machinery (e.g. a bucket loader) or other available farmyard machinery (e.g. windrow turner). \n\nIn the first week of composting, it is recommended to turn the solid manure windrow twice to facilitate aeration and the development of high temperatures within the windrow . Later, reversals are necessary at intervals of 10 days to 3 weeks, in order to maintain the airflow in the middle of the heap. After the last reversal, it is then necessary to wait at least 3 more weeks .\nReversals have an immediate effect on the temperature. Several reversals are essential to ensure that all the compost has been subjected to a high temperature. The operation of reversal ensures homogenisation of materials, increases passive aeration, and provides the proper conditions for the aerobic decomposition. The period that active composting normally lasts ranges from 8 to 12 weeks. \n\nStatic aerated piles \nThis is an alternative method, which uses air supplied by perforated piping or a porous floor below the pile, therefore avoiding the reversal and mixing. Aeration can be forced (air is forced into the composting material) or passive (convective movement of air into the composting material).\n\nComposting in-vessel (with forced aeration)\nComposting is carried out in closed, aerated concrete silos/tanks or channels (composting vessels). The bottom of these modules is equipped with a system of perforated pipes, allowing forced aeration by blowing air into the substrate. The system is controlled by temperature sensors, allowing the aeration to be recorded and adjusted. Once the silo is charged with solid manure, a cover is anchored on the walls of the silo. Forced aeration is maintained for 6 weeks and then the silo is uncovered and emptied for the compost to mature in a heap . Composting drums can also be used.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe technique produces an organic fertiliser (compost) with part of the original inorganic, readily available nitrogen content converted to organic forms, and most of the phosphorus in a concentrated form (due to water evaporation). The organic matter is humified and the product is odourless and pathogen-free. As a result, during landspreading of the composted product, reduced odour and NH3 emissions, and emissions of nitrogen compounds from leaching, are expected  .\n\nThe benefits in terms of the fertiliser product obtained depend on the type of manure, the pretreatment technique, the additives, and on the composting technique, and cannot be quantified in a general sense. \n\nIn France, the product of composting (compost manure) is considered an organic fertiliser, deodorised and hygienised. It supplies organic matter to the ground, and the organic form of nitrogen allows a gradual release to the plants. A priori, compost manure may be applied in the autumn and winter without risking an increase in nitrate leaching .\n\nCross-media effects\nIn partly aerobic conditions, such as in unsealed manure heaps, part of the inorganic nitrogen (10-55 % of the nitrogen) is lost through volatilisation as ammonia emissions. N2O emissions and NO3- losses as leachate may also occur . The nitrogen losses reduce the fertiliser value of the manure, resulting in the need for supplementing it with a mineral fertiliser, with consequent increased indirect emissions for its production. Loss of carbon during composting also reduces the nutrient content of the resulting product. \n\nConditions during composting imply a risk of increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, since aeration leads to a temperature increase and, thereby, also to much higher activity of the anaerobic bacteria. Methane emissions are very likely to occur if anaerobic zones are developed inside the composting mass, as are nitrous oxide emissions in the case of improper aeration of the whole manure heap (i.e. anaerobic zones in the centre imply that there may be aerobic/anaerobic transition zones in the compost).\n\nThe volatilisation of nitrogen can also be reduced by means of a cover. Peat is suggested as the cover, as acid sphagnum peat (Sphagnum fuscum) has a better nitrogen-binding capacity than straw, sawdust or cutter chips for example. However, peat is a non-renewable resource and its extraction leads to significant emissions of greenhouse gases. On the other hand, it is also reported that covers were not found to have any significant effect on aerial emissions during composting in a study carried out in France .\n\nAir scrubbing systems for manure composting facilities are well tested as an additional method to reduce NH3 emissions from this source, but have significant costs . No composting installation at the farm scale is reported to be equipped with air cleaning systems \n.\n\nIf the heap is put on soil and not on an impermeable base, part of the nitrogen that sinks into the soil evaporates, and plants use part of it after the heap is removed. Depending on the amount of run-off, the soil surface and the soil type, part of the nitrogen may also leach into the surface waters or groundwater.\n\nAbout half of the potassium in manure may be lost due to composting. Potassium is lost only in run-off water, and these emissions can be reduced by means of a watertight cover over the compost. The cover prevents the leaching caused by rainwater, but it does not prevent the liquids produced in the compost from sinking into the ground. If composting is performed in a barn, losses to the soil or from leaching during the composting process are non-existent.\n\nIn the composting process, suboptimal conditions may eventually result. Odour emissions would be indicative of the occurrence, as odorous compounds are mostly volatile organic sulphur compounds produced under anaerobic conditions. In the case of silo composting with forced aeration, odours are controlled by incorporation of a neutralising product into the dry air. \nEnergy consumption is required, in particular when forced aeration is used for composting. Water is needed in the process to maintain a suitable moisture content of the manure \n.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nComposting periods may last up to 6 months or more, but can be shortened by frequent turning and aeration. The required operational parameters for composting using animal by-products (including manure) are specified in European Regulation 142/2011, as well as the specifications of the final compost products. The key operating parameters and transformation requirements are reported below.\n\nMoisture content between 40 % and 70 % . Below 30 %, bacteria activity is inhibited. In general, solid manures from deep litter housing systems (broilers, turkeys, guinea fowl) are not suitable for a smooth composting process, due to the high dry matter content, ranging between 65 % and 80 %. The ideal dry matter content should be about 40 % to 50 %; for the purpose, moisture (water, slurry, etc.) in sufficient quantity has to be added at the beginning of composting, at the time of building the windrows. As an example, one tonne of solid manure with a dry matter content of 75 % requires 500 litres of water in order to reach a dry matter content of 50 %. A very moist mixture does not favour composting because it prevents aeration . \nOxygen supply > 0.5 mg/l.\nPorosity of the heap between 30 % and 60 % (as air-filled porosity).\nCarbon/Nitrogen ratio (C/N) in the range of 20-35. \nTemperature of the heap between 50 degC and 60 degC. Product hygienisation is ensured by monitoring the temperature as an indicator. In general, if the material remains at 50 degC for over 6 weeks, most pathogens will be destroyed (viruses, bacteria and parasites), while, at a temperature of between 40 degC and 50 degC for 6 weeks, only parasitic worms are destroyed. At a temperature below 40 degC for 6 weeks, no sanitation occurs. A general practice is to maintain the temperature above 55 degC for 25 to 30 days \n. Hygienisation is also achieved if the temperature is kept above 55 degC for 2 weeks or above 65 degC for 1 week .\nRegulation 142/2011 sets the minimum temperature (70 degC) that all material must remain at without interruption for 60 minutes. However, the competent authority may authorise the use of other specific requirements provided that they guarantee an equivalent effect regarding the reduction of pathogens.\n\nThe use of tarpaulins for covering the windrows limits odour emissions and flies, allows better integration of windrows in the landscape (positive psychological effect on the neighbourhood), provides health protection from birds and rodents, and essential protection in case of heavy rain. A semi-permeable geotextile cover offers the advantage of being permeable to gas and allows good drainage of water on the surface of the windrow .\n\nFor the application of the composting technique in the UK, the readily available nitrogen content of FYM is typically reduced from 20-25 % to 10-15 % of total N (in composted FYM) due to NH4-N conversion to NO3-N and organic nitrogen. Composting has a smaller effect on the proportion of readily available nitrogen in poultry manure. Composting typically results in 40-50 % of the total N in FYM and around 15-20 % in poultry litter being lost (either as NH3, N2O or in leachate) . \n\nFor composting poultry manure in France, if reversals are very frequent, losses can be as high as 50-60 % of the total N present. With three reversals, losses are generally around 30-40 % of the total N present. After composting solid poultry manure, the volume and weight reduction is reported to be typically in the range of 30-50 % . \n\nAmmonia emissions can be reduced by composting manure with a high C/N ratio (20-35), and by carefully balancing the frequency of heap reversals, in order to achieve sufficient aeration with minimum disturbance. Nitrogen losses as high as 70 % have been reported, through ammonia volatilisation . The supply of air to composting (and aerobic digestion systems) requires a fine balance; too high airflows encourage NH3 volatilisation, while low flows encourage methane and nitrous oxide emissions .\n\nThe typical dimensions of windrows do not exceed 1.8-2 m in height and \n3.5-4 m in width . If the windrow height is excessive (more than 3 m), the resulting compression will not let air pass. If windrows are too small, they will be susceptible to cooling down easily . The area needed for composting manure coming from a 1 000 m2 building is reported to be 800 m2 for turkeys and between 750 m2 and 1 000 m2 for broilers . Windrows of approximately 3.5 m wide and 2 m high (corresponding to 6 m3/m of linear length) are needed. Also, a traffic lane of 4 m for the machines and 10 m to 15 m at the end of windrows is generally needed for facilitating manoeuvres.\n\nThe energy use depends on the composting technique applied. Without aeration and turning of the heaps, the energy use would be negligible. The energy consumption varies between 5 kWh/tonne of raw manure for turning only, and between 8 kWh and 50 kWh/tonne of raw manure for farms that apply ventilation through or over the heaps as well. From France, the energy consumption for composting by forced ventilation is reported to be 1 980 kWh of electricity per year and 480 l of fuel per year, to treat 600 t of manure . Water needs are reported to be between 250 l and 650 l/tonne of manure . A comparison of composting applied to different pig solid manures are described below in Table   4 .310, as reported by France.\n\n\nTable 4.310:\tNitrogen and weight losses during composting of solid pig manure, in France \n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nDue to cross-media effects, the technique is applicable when manure cannot be transported for landspreading at a reasonable cost and pathogen and odour reduction is important prior to landspreading. The technique requires enough space available for windrows to be established. \n\nThe process is relatively simple and can be applied on small-scale individual farms, using standard farm equipment, but it needs proper control to avoid anaerobic processes that could lead to an odour nuisance. If process control and emission reduction are required, then the composting installation needs to be larger for (cost-)efficient operation.\n\nIn France, the process can also be implemented for temporary field heaps of solid manure on flat soil with low permeability (in different places every year and without using the same field for at least 3 years). The process should not last more than 2 months.\n\nComposting should not be carried out on filtering soils, on waterlogged soils, or on sloped land. All measures should be taken to avoid stagnation of storm water under windrows and to accommodate the disposal of contaminated water . Specially designed composting machines or windrow turners do a more efficient job, but the high costs limit their use to large individual farms only. As a result, composting machinery is usually provided by cooperatives or machinery rings . \n\nEconomics\nComposting with mechanical reversal of heaps (windrow composting) \nThe operating cost, including the clearing out of the buildings, the formation of the windrows, two reversals and the spreading of the compost, is reported from France as follows :\n\nfor a pig farm with 550 fattening places, the cost is EUR 0.01-0.02 per kg of pig produced;\nin a poultry meat farm of 1 000 m2, the cost is between EUR 7.9 and EUR 9.9 per tonne of manure produced per year. \n\nThe purchase of necessary reversing tools in France is often shared, e.g. in Cooperative of Use of Farm Equipment (CUFE) (Cooperative of Use of Farm Equipment). The investment cost for a machine of 4 m in width, for working with windrows, is reported to be about EUR 42 000 . Other examples of investment costs for the necessary composting equipment are reported in Table   4 .311.\n\n\nTable 4.311:\tInvestment costs for equipment used in composting plants \n\n\nThe operating costs are reported to be equal to EUR 20/tonne produced, and the income from compost sales ranges from EUR 15 to EUR 30 per tonne. \n\nComposting in vessels with forced aeration\nThis system is economically viable only for large manure volumes in France. In a reported example, the investment costs for the equipment to treat 600 tonnes of manure per year is amortised over 10 years, resulting in an annualised investment cost of EUR 10 per tonne of pig produced (manure resulting from 2 700 fattening pigs per year), or EUR 6.2 per tonne of poultry manure (four buildings of 1 000 m2 each with 150 t of manure per building per year). The operating cost of the system (including clearing out of the buildings, handling of the silos and spreading of the compost) is obviously variable, depending on the production and the size of the farm. From France, the operating cost is reported to be equal to EUR 0.02 per kg of pig produced and EUR 11.4 per tonne of poultry manure .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nComposted solid manure has little odour, is more stable, contains fewer pathogens and is relatively dry. This improves handling, storage, transportation and landspreading without the risk of transferring diseases (e.g. landspreading on ready-to-eat crops)  . Transport costs are reduced due to the significant reduction of mass due to water evaporation. \n\nExample plants\nThe technique is applied at farm level, as well as in centralised plants, in various Member States; for example, 400 farm-scale plants are reported in the UK, 127 in Spain (Catalonia), 32 in Romania and 100 in France . In France, around 200 farms are affiliated with one commercial organisation using the forced aeration variant of the technique. \n\nReference literature\n             \n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4261184_abstract", "x": 0.7068524, "y": 0.2333864, "title": "COMBINED FUEL CELL AND DIGESTION SYSTEM AND METHOD OF OPERATING THEREOF", "year": 2023, "text": "A system includes a digestion system configured to convert a digestate into a fuel gas, and a fuel cell power system configured to convert the fuel gas into power and heat, and to provide the heat to the digestion system.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.10.5\" title=\"Manure processing\">\n<references_to>4.12</references_to>\n\n<content>\nManure processing \n\nThe techniques for manure (solid or slurry) processing having a significant effect on odour emissions are (see Section 4.12):\n\naerobic digestion (aeration) of liquid manure/slurry;\ncomposting of solid manure;\nanaerobic digestion.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3626816_abstract", "x": 0.4872912, "y": 0.07323767, "title": "BACILLUS SUBTILIS SUBSPECIES", "year": 2020, "text": "The present invention relates to novel subspecies of Bacillus.

Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecium rapidly install in animal intestines and improve the sanitary state and the growth performance.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe enhanced animal performance in feed conversion reduces the excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus, since more nutrients are retained in the animal bodies.

These materials are generally arranged in layers, i.e. the filter bed consists of coarse material on the untreated exhaust air side and finer material on the clean air side. Fine-grained filter materials have a relatively large specific surface area that facilitates mass transfer but, on the other hand, causes higher pressure losses. \n\nThe filter material is kept sufficiently moist at all times, so that microorganism populations can form a film. This is achieved by either humidifying the exhaust air to a relative humidity of at least 95 % and/or by controlled intermittent sprinkling of the surface of the filter material. Moistening of the entire filter surface is required in order not to compromise performance, even if the air entering is saturated; in particular in summer and in open surface filters, it is necessary to compensate for evaporation losses. Gaseous compounds are absorbed by the moisture film of the biofilter material and are oxidised or degraded by microorganisms living on the moisturised filter material.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBiofilters are mainly used to eliminate odours arising from houses with no bedding material. They can also be used in litterless housing for dust separation, if coarsely structured filter material (which does not tend to clog) is used at least on the crude gas side. \n\nAmmonia is also degraded in biofilters, but the possible cross-media effects need to be taken into account. This aspect, together with the unknown decline of the performance over time, makes the ammonia removal efficiency of biofilters controversial. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe system involves an extra pressure drop of roughly 30-150 Pa , which depends on the filter surface load, the type and height of the filter material and its age. Ventilating fans must be able to overcome the added resistance; therefore, additional energy consumption is required for ventilation. The water consumed for moistening the substrate is reported to be in the range of 5-7 litres per 1 000 m3 of exhaust air.\n\nThe system is not suitable as a sole process for ammonia reduction from exhaust air from livestock houses with a high ammonia load. Due to the separation of ammonia, the microbial activity is influenced and the pH value is significantly lowered (no adjustments are possible), while the formed salts cannot be removed. Finally, secondary trace gases are formed, such as nitrous oxides and N2O, which risk the functionality of the whole system. \n\nIf the bed scrubber filter material consists of peat, a significant emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) would be associated with the peat mining process, while GHG emissions from the farm system itself may become significant due to the potential formation of N2O.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nBiofilters function properly if:\n\nthe pollutants to be treated are water-soluble and biodegradable;\nthe residence time of the exhaust air to be cleaned is long enough that the odorants can be separated and degraded by microorganisms without these components or reaction products accumulating in the biofilter material;\nthe operating conditions guarantee a sufficient supply of oxygen, water and nutrients to the microorganisms at temperatures of 10 degC to 35 degC . \n\nA capacity of 440 m3/h of exhaust air per m2 of filter surface has been reported. Based on this value and knowing the airflow rate that has to be treated, the dimensions for a filter module can be estimated. The thickness of the active filter layer is normally between 0.3 m and 1.4 m, depending on the material (for coarser materials a large bed height is necessary), whereas the residence (contact) time ranges from 4 seconds to 20 seconds depending on the filter height and surface load. Upscaling or downscaling of the treatment capacity, due to the modular design, is possible.\n\nThe sprinkling of the filter with fresh water (approximately 5-7 litres of water/1 000 m3 of outgoing air, achieving a 60-70 % material moisture) is automatically controlled on the basis of the airflow volume. The filter is moistened from the surface by two nozzles per filter module. \n\nThe resource demand for operating a biofilter with a capacity of 255 000 m3/h exhaust air volume, corresponding to an animal house of 3 000 animal places for fattening pigs, is reported in Table   4 .270. About 21 kWh/animal place per year of energy is needed for pressure compensation in the ventilation system. Furthermore, 1.53 m3/animal place per year of water consumption is necessary.\n\n\nTable 4.270:\tAnnual resources demand for the operation of a biofilter, in Germany \n\n\nAs for all air cleaning systems, the odour removal efficiency depends on the crude gas concentration and is reported to be from 84 % to 97 % . The minimum requirement for odour reduction of air cleaning systems applied in Germany is defined as an odour concentration in the clean gas not exceeding 300 ouE/m3 and no typical process odours (e.g. animal house odour) are perceptible in the clean gas. Biofilters achieving a removal efficiency for odour of over 70 % have only been verified in pig housing . \n\nThe dust abatement efficiency is reported to be from 80 % to 100 %  \n. Measurements of the finest dust fraction, PM2.5, indicate an abatement efficiency of 63 % .\n\nIn Germany, the application of biofilters for ammonia reduction is not recommended, but, at the same time, it is acknowledged that a biofilter can also be operated as an ammonia abatement technique under certain conditions (e.g. in combination with a water curtain) and if carefully operated (comparable to the requirements for bioscrubbers) . The ammonia abatement efficiency is reported to be over 70 %  and up to 89 %, but it is not clear whether the removal efficiency can stay high over time due to the secondary effects previously described (see 'Cross-media effects')  \n.\n\nIn order not to undermine the removal capacity of the bed, regular replacement of the biofilter packing is necessary. Pretreating the air in order to remove the main part of the ammonia load before it enters the biofilter minimises the formation of nitrite/nitrate salts and allows a much longer packing lifespan and thus reduces refilling costs . Used biofilter materials are applied to land. No additional waste water is produced.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nBiofilters are mainly used in houses with no bedding material (slurry-based plants). As the filter area requirement is approximately 0.2-0.25 m2 per animal place, a sufficient area must exist outside the facilities to accommodate the filter packages.\n\nThe implementation in existing houses with forced ventilation must be planned with the adaptation of exhaust air ducts and with significant additional requirements for ventilation, making biofilters in practice only applicable where a centralised ventilation system is used.\n\nEconomics\nData are given for a capacity of 255 000 m3/h exhaust air volume, equivalent to 3 000 fattening pig places. A total annual cost of between EUR 11.60/ap and EUR 13.10/ap results from the amortisation (20 years for construction and 4 % interest rate) of the investment requirements (EUR 59-64/ap, annualised investment costs from EUR 6.5/ap to EUR 6.8/ap) added to annual operating costs of EUR 5.10-6.30 per animal place.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLocal high emission loads or insufficient spatial distances from odour-sensitive receptors are drivers. \n\nExample plants\nAt least 267 German farms are using this technique . \n\nReference literature \n    \n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3845821_abstract", "x": 0.7702837, "y": 0.37674117, "title": "AIR-CONDITIONING AND AIR-CLEANING EQUIPMENT", "year": 2021, "text": "Proposed is air-conditioning and air-cleaning equipment including: a first air conditioning housing configured to draw in outside air and the inside air of the building to form mixed air; a second air conditioning housing configured to receive the mixed air from the first air conditioning housing and to stagnate the mixed air in the second air conditioning housing; a third air conditioning housing configured to receive a part of the mixed air from the second air conditioning housing; a fourth air conditioning housing configured to receive partial mixed air from the third air conditioning housing and to purify the partial mixed air to form clean air; and a fifth air conditioning housing configured to receive the clean air from the fourth air conditioning housing and to expel the clean air into the interior of the building.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.10.1.4\" title=\"Air cleaning systems\">\n<references_to>4.9.3, 4.9.5, 4.9.6</references_to>\n\n<content>\nAir cleaning systems\n\nLocal conditions may be decisive for the adoption of abatement techniques, as is the case of densely populated areas in the Netherlands.

Fully developed cavities are typically in the range of 500000 to 2000000 m3. The actual volume left by dissolution depends on the brine field layout, the depth and thickness of the salt deposit, and the possibilities for future use (e.g. gas storage). In favourable conditions, each cavity is essentially a self contained unit with no cross connection to other cavities and is hydraulically sealed, in order to avoid any contact between the saturated brine in the cavity and any underlying or overlying aquifers or groundwater flows.\n\nMethods for the underground disposal of the distillation solids in salt cavities have been developed. Firstly, the suspended insoluble material is separated from the clear liquor phase in the thickeners and is then re-suspended in saturated crude brine. The resulting slurry is then pumped to dedicated 'disused' salt cavities where the solids settle out within the large volume of the cavity. Displaced brine from the cavity is recycled for the repeated transport of the solids. \n\nThe most critical aspects of this activity are:\n\nto avoid dilution of the saturated brine with water which can lead to further salt dissolution with eventual destabilisation of the cavity \nthe control of calcium sulphate concentration of the brine phase to avoid scaling in the pipeline\nthe control of temperature.\n\nAs with basin settling, the clear liquor phase is discharged to the local watercourse and may require pH adjustment (see Section 2.3.10.3.2) using one of a range of techniques. \n\nIf excess CO2 is used to reduce the alkalinity of the liquor, further solid separation is required before liquor discharge to the local watercourse. Where settling solids in ponds continues to be used in combination with cavity disposal, lagoon capacity is maintained by regular dredging of solid material, suspension in saturated brine and disposal to the brine cavity.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nUnderground disposal assures a high sedimentation efficiency of solid matter suspended in waste waters from distillation, refer to Section 2.3.4.1. Given the separation of the majority of solids from distillation waste waters, cleaner waste waters leaving underground salt brine cavities are discharged to the local watercourse, and thus the impact on the aquatic environment is substantially reduced.\n\nCross-media effects\nNo side-effects or disadvantages associated with applying this technique have been reported. \n\nOperational data\nApart from the information included in the 'Description' above, no other data are available.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable for all soda ash plants in the EU-25, in those locations where salt brine cavities are not being used for storing natural gas, and where the cavities meet all the technical parameters required for underground disposal of solids from the production of soda ash.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe reduction of the impact of the production of soda ash on the aquatic environment.\n\nExample plants\nWinnington soda ash plant, UK\n\nReference literature\n[33, CEFIC-ESAPA, 2004], [85, EIPPCB, 2004-2005].\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3421619_abstract", "x": 0.6832804, "y": 0.36177632, "title": "ASPIRATION COVER OF CONVERTER DUST CAP", "year": 2019, "text": "The invention relates to metallurgy and more particularly to fume and dust extraction devices.

In ore preparation, dust emissions are best controlled using high integrity bag filters with appropriate filter cloth material and a maintenance routine to minimise dust emissions.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nLess energy required for drying (and grinding) the titanium ore delivered with a low moisture content and, therefore, less CO2, SOX and NOX emissions, that would otherwise result from the generation of an additional amount of energy required for drying more humid ore.\n\nCross-media effects\nIncreased amounts of dust may be expected when the titaniferous ore is handled in a dry state.\n\nOperational data\nThe ore (ilmenite, titanium slag) is dried to a humidity content of <0.1 % [42, UBA-Germany, 2001]. Dust and NOX emission levels are as presented in Section 3.3.3.3.1. Specific emissions of dust to air are in the range of 0.0002 to 0.08 kg/t TiO2 [20, CEFIC-TDMA, 2004], the maximum emissions of dust to air being reported at the level of 4 kg/t TiO2 [42, UBA-Germany, 2001]. Specific emissions of NOX to air are in the range of 0.002 to 0.04 kg/t TiO2 [20, CEFIC-TDMA, 2004].\n\nApplicability\nThis technique is applicable to all TiO2 plants using the sulphate process route.\n\nEconomics\nNo data submitted.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduced emissions from drying.

These include factors such as feedstock type, feedstock blend, grade mix, total production requirements, water addition, efficiency of chlorine abatement, etc. For environmental and commercial reasons, it is important to recover as much hydrogen chloride as possible. \n\nWith variable off-gas conditions and volumes, today's technology applies aqueous absorption of the hydrochloric acid from the off-gas. An advantage of this process is that the off-gas consists largely of gases that are only slightly soluble in water except for hydrogen chloride, which is to be removed. Using this technology, recovery efficiencies of 99.5 - 99.9 % are predicted. \n\nIn theory, under ideal conditions, 99.99 % recovery should be achievable whilst minimising the build up of water in the system. However, in practice, plants operate under constantly changing conditions because of the need to vary loads, feedstock and the grade of silica being manufactured. This results in fluctuations in the absorption system and consequently practical HCl recovery efficiencies are of the order of 97 %.\n\nBoth countercurrent and cocurrent process systems are used by the industry. In theory, cocurrent systems should be more efficient as the streams should come to equilibrium quicker. However, in practice, due to the quantity of inert gases in the process, neither configuration is preferable as it is the rate of diffusion through the inert gases that controls the absorption rate. Because of this, both process systems achieve comparable recoveries.\n\nAbsorption equipment is very prone to fouling, so the first step in the recovery process is usually the removal of any carryover silica, which has a particle size range of 0.5 - 10 microns in aqueous dispersion, by either venturi scrubber or filtration. It is important to remove these particles because the absorption of hydrogen chloride in water generates approximately 1900 kJ/kg HCl (1.9  3.8 GJ/tonne of silica) of heat that must be removed from the system in order to keep the recovery efficiencies high. Significant silica carryover would foul heat exchangers and block the absorption equipment.\n\nIt is desirable and most efficient to produce hydrochloric acid that is as concentrated as possible to minimise processing, handling and transport costs. In practice, this is about 32 % HCl because this is about the strongest hydrochloric acid that is stable at ambient temperatures. In order to obtain acid of this strength, a minimum of two absorption stages are normally required. Single pass processes generally start with water, this usually being the case if aqueous hydrochloric acid is being exported from the process and used in another operation or sold to external consumers. Alternatively, recycled acid at about 20 % is used if anhydrous hydrochloric acid is to be generated. The strength of the acid is not taken much lower than this during the production of anhydrous hydrochloric acid because the nearer the acid concentration approaches to the azeotropic strength of 20 %, the harder it becomes to strip-off hydrochloric gas. The heat that is liberated in the recovery process must be removed in order to achieve acceptable recovery efficiencies. An effective way to do this, is to make the second stage an adiabatic absorption step. This minimises the number of heat exchangers required in total, as the heat generated here is used to evaporate the water out of the system that is introduced from the off-gas. Various types of absorption equipment can be utilised for the first stage, such as spray towers, packed towers, and falling film exchangers.\n\nTypically, after the off-gas has been through a two stage absorption process, it will still contain up to 150 mg/m3 hydrochloric acid. These residual levels of hydrochloric acid are usually recovered by passing the off-gas through either a final absorption column, venturi scrubber or jet washer, depending upon the maximum residual hydrochloric acid that is acceptable in the off-gas. The weak acid solution containing 1 - 2 % hydrochloric acid, that is generated by this recovery process, is then used as a feed stream into the main absorption process.\n\nAfter the completion of the individual absorption steps virtually all of the hydrochloric acid will have been recovered leaving <10 mg/m3 of HCl in the off-gas from the process.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSubstantial removal of hydrogen chloride from the off-gas released to the atmosphere.\n\nCross-media effects\nNo data submitted.\n\nOperational data\nThe process off-gas contains between 10 - 20 % hydrogen chloride.

In a parallel flow system arrangement, the solution passes from one evaporator to the next in the same direction as the steam. This has the advantage that, as pressure increases in the various evaporators, the solution flows from one evaporator to the next by the force of gravity. \n\nThe disadvantage is that the weakest (pressure) and coldest (temperature) steam must evaporate the most concentrated solution, and therefore, a greater vacuum is needed for each evaporator to achieve a sufficient rise in temperature for proper heat transfer. Pure condensates obtained from indirect steam contact in the concentration step can be utilised to produce steam.

The effect is achieved by means of geometry and the type of intake, resulting in the flow patterns usually seen in these types of systems. Cyclones are composed of a cylindrical chamber that tapers downward towards the collected dust exit. Cyclones may be either conventional or high efficiency units. The latter have a smaller diameter, and therefore achieve a greater centrifugal effect. The final choice must be made by considering both the technical and economic aspects, as the higher efficiency units have higher pressure losses, which entails greater energy consumption.\nCyclones are used extensively and are normally connected to another more efficient system that removes larger particles, reducing the flow of such large particles into the main purification equipment.\n\nCyclones can separate particles above 10 microns with a maximum efficiency of 90 %, although the efficiency for particle sizes below 2 - 3 microns is no more than 25 %.\n\nGas scrubbers\nWet gas scrubbers are types of devices where a liquid (usually water) is used to collect dust and mist. To trap particles, liquid is sprayed into the gas current forming a mist, the droplets of which pick up most of the particles. Depending on the design and the operating conditions, these scrubbers can be adapted to retain both coarse and fine particles. The operating process consists of two different steps: one of contact, in which the mist is generated and the dust-laden gas flow comes into contact with it, and a second entrainment separation step, in which the mist and dust particles are separated from clean gas by inertia or impact.\n\nVenturi scrubbers are the most widely used type in this industry because of their simplicity and flexibility. Current designs are based on the down-flow of gas through the venturi contactor. They are useful as gas absorbers for relatively soluble gases. Other less energy consuming types of scrubbers are also applied.\n\nBag filters\nThe efficiency in the retention of particles in a bag filter depends on an adequate choice of filter. In general, bag filters consist of a series of tubes with a wall made of the filtering medium (bags) supported by an adequate structure. The assembly contains a cylindrical or parallel piped chamber that terminates at the bottom in a hopper-shaped collector. The gas stream to be treated passes through the filtering medium, where the particles are retained on the surface, gradually building up a thickness that improves retention efficiency, but increases the pressure drop. The filters are cleaned regularly by mechanical means (vibration, tapping) or by air circulated in the opposite direction, either continuously or in bursts. The selection of filtering material must take into account the composition and temperature of the gases, the nature of the particles and their size, the de-dusting efficiency required, and the economics of the process. High gas temperatures frequently require the use of a gas cooling system, since the maximum temperatures that these bag filters can withstand rarely exceed 250 oC.\n\nThe selection of filtering material is an essential factor from a technical and economic point of view. This material may account for 5 to 20 % of the total cost of the equipment. In addition, the repair and replacement of bags is one of the main items of the operating cost. Bag filters can achieve particle retention efficiencies higher than 99 %. The achievable emission ranges for bag filters are less than 20 mg/m3, with some applications attaining levels well below this value.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of dust emissions from the production of STPP.\n\nCross-media effects\nWaste waters may be generated when wet gas scrubbers are used. However, some setups do not generate waste water, for instance by re-using it in the sodium orthophosphate purification step or by collecting relatively clean water obtained by condensation during the concentration step.\n\nOperational data\nNo other data have been submitted other than those included in Table   6 .143 above.\n\nApplicability\nThis technique is applicable for the plants producing STPP.\n\nEconomics\nSee data included in Table   6 .143.

The final choice must be made by considering both the technical and economic aspects, as the higher efficiency units have higher pressure losses, which entails greater energy consumption.\nCyclones are used extensively and are normally connected to another more efficient system that removes larger particles, reducing the flow of such large particles into the main purification equipment.\n\nCyclones can separate particles above 10 microns with a maximum efficiency of 90 %, although the efficiency for particle sizes below 2 - 3 microns is no more than 25 %.\n\nGas scrubbers\nWet gas scrubbers are types of devices where a liquid (usually water) is used to collect dust and mist. To trap particles, liquid is sprayed into the gas current forming a mist, the droplets of which pick up most of the particles. Depending on the design and the operating conditions, these scrubbers can be adapted to retain both coarse and fine particles. The operating process consists of two different steps: one of contact, in which the mist is generated and the dust-laden gas flow comes into contact with it, and a second entrainment separation step, in which the mist and dust particles are separated from clean gas by inertia or impact.\n\nVenturi scrubbers are the most widely used type in this industry because of their simplicity and flexibility. Current designs are based on the down-flow of gas through the venturi contactor. They are useful as gas absorbers for relatively soluble gases. Other less energy consuming types of scrubbers are also applied.\n\nBag filters\nThe efficiency in the retention of particles in a bag filter depends on an adequate choice of filter. In general, bag filters consist of a series of tubes with a wall made of the filtering medium (bags) supported by an adequate structure. The assembly contains a cylindrical or parallel piped chamber that terminates at the bottom in a hopper-shaped collector. The gas stream to be treated passes through the filtering medium, where the particles are retained on the surface, gradually building up a thickness that improves retention efficiency, but increases the pressure drop. The filters are cleaned regularly by mechanical means (vibration, tapping) or by air circulated in the opposite direction, either continuously or in bursts. The selection of filtering material must take into account the composition and temperature of the gases, the nature of the particles and their size, the de-dusting efficiency required, and the economics of the process. High gas temperatures frequently require the use of a gas cooling system, since the maximum temperatures that these bag filters can withstand rarely exceed 250 oC.\n\nThe selection of filtering material is an essential factor from a technical and economic point of view. This material may account for 5 to 20 % of the total cost of the equipment. In addition, the repair and replacement of bags is one of the main items of the operating cost. Bag filters can achieve particle retention efficiencies higher than 99 %. The achievable emission ranges for bag filters are less than 20 mg/m3, with some applications attaining levels well below this value.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of dust emissions from the production of STPP.\n\nCross-media effects\nWaste waters may be generated when wet gas scrubbers are used.

In some cases, where sulphite production is undertaken in facilities which are part of a much larger chemical industrial complex, sulphur dioxide generated at the site in other chemical processes can be used. Making sulphur dioxide at the site of sodium sulphite production, creates a low inventory/low pressure regime, but with the added complication of the manufacturing process and the disadvantages of requiring large equipment and producing large vent flows. It can, however, provide a net input of energy.\n\nAbatement\nThe key driver in improving environmental performance is the successful retention of sulphur (as sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide) in the process by good design and operation of the abatement systems. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nProper design and operation of both the 'sulphites' plant and the abatement systems, results in the minimisation of discharges of sulphur compounds (SO2 and H2S) to the atmosphere. The released sulphur compounds are recycled back into the process.\nIn chemical industrial complexes where sulphite production is integrated with other chemical plants, process emissions from the sulphite production can be recycled into other chemical manufacturing processes.\n\nCross-media effects\nPurchasing sulphur dioxide in a liquefied form creates a more significant inventory hazard, but if designed, managed and operated properly tends to lead to lower emissions to air.\n\nOperational data\nRefer to Section 7.16.2 and Figure   7 .110 above. Detailed data on emission levels are included in Section 7.16.3. In particular, specific emissions from the sulphite reactions step should not exceed 2 kg SO2 per tonne of 'sulphites' produced [61, Entec UK Limited, 2004]. \n\nReactions of sulphur dioxide with alkaline solutions are quite rapid and most material will be reacted at this stage.

Apart from the emission of combustion products, furnace emissions also contain dust and traces of chlorides and fluorides that were present in the raw materials (soda ash and sand).\n\nIn some cases, of particular importance here is the content of the fluoride ions (F-) in sand used for the production of sodium silicate (e.g. when a dolomite deposit is neighbouring a sand quarry) and, hence, the primary measure to be applied, is to use low fluoride sand. Also, following customer requests, specific solid water glass formulations may require the use of sand containing fluoride, and then there will be emissions of hydrogen fluoride. The addition of cullet may have an opposing influence on the emissions of hydrogen fluoride, as from one side, cullet may contain a high content of fluoride, and from the other, the addition of cullet would lower the melting temperature and the volatilisation of the fluorides. \n\nTo keep the emissions of hydrogen fluoride in the outlet gas at a low level, raw materials low in fluoride should be used for the production of sodium silicate, combined with the dry acid scrubbing. The dry acid scrubbing, which - if necessary - may also be applied as a secondary end-of-pipe measure in the abatement of the emissions of SO2 and HCl (see Sections 7.8.4.2 and 7.8.4.4 above), consists in the dispersion of the reactive material (the absorbent) in the waste gas stream.

Apart from the emission of combustion products, furnace emissions also contain dust and traces of chlorides and fluorides that were present in the raw materials (soda ash and sand).\n\nIn some cases, of particular importance here is the content of the fluoride ions (F-) in sand used for the production of sodium silicate (e.g. when a dolomite deposit is neighbouring a sand quarry) and, hence, the primary measure to be applied, is to use low fluoride sand. Also, following customer requests, specific solid water glass formulations may require the use of sand containing fluoride, and then there will be emissions of hydrogen fluoride. The addition of cullet may have an opposing influence on the emissions of hydrogen fluoride, as from one side, cullet may contain a high content of fluoride, and from the other, the addition of cullet would lower the melting temperature and the volatilisation of the fluorides. \n\nTo keep the emissions of hydrogen fluoride in the outlet gas at a low level, raw materials low in fluoride should be used for the production of sodium silicate, combined with the dry acid scrubbing. The dry acid scrubbing, which - if necessary - may also be applied as a secondary end-of-pipe measure in the abatement of the emissions of SO2 and HCl (see Sections 7.8.4.2 and 7.8.4.4 above), consists in the dispersion of the reactive material (the absorbent) in the waste gas stream.

The waste gas from the oven has a much lower volume and a higher temperature than the forming area waste gas. Therefore, particularly in glass wool processes, the build-up of resinous material in the ducting represents a risk of fire and even explosion. The water sprayed into the gas has a substantial cooling effect and some substances are condensed from the waste gas. This does not necessarily mean the substances are removed and in the early parts of the system, material will be volatilised from the dirty process water. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nDue to the low pressure drop in the system, the removal efficiency for fine particulate matter is quite low; however, the use of impact jets and cyclones promotes condensation of some substances, preventing the build-up of residues in the ducting and the risk of fire, with consequent atmospheric emissions. As in the forming area, the system is a dynamic equilibrium and gaseous emissions are heavily dependent on the process water and binder chemistries.\n\nCross-media effects\nUnless another technique is used to remove entrained water (e.g. packed bed, cyclone, demister), this technique can lead to high water consumption and emissions of mists. \n\nOperational data \nThe emission levels that are achieved using this technique are given in Table   4 .121.\n\nApplicability\nAs for the forming area, in principle, this technique is applicable to all mineral wool processes. It is not used in many stone wool plants because it is not deemed necessary for process cleaning, and could adversely affect the performance of other techniques.

In common with the combustion modification techniques described in Section 4.4.2.1, the optimisation of combustion for FENIX relates to:\n\nthe reduction of excess air;\nthe suppression of hotspots thanks to the homogenisation of flame temperatures; and a controlled mixing of the fuel and combustion air, without giving rise to glass quality problems or carbon monoxide emissions.\n\nThe FENIX process also involves a complete modification of the combustion system and particularly the use of a new type of injector. These injectors are under patent registration and are different depending on the type of energy used (gas, heavy oil or mixed energy) and are associated with new furnace designs including:\n\noverall dimensions (length, width, depth of glass), also depending on the pull rate\ndesign of burner ports\nregenerators (separate chambers).\nThe technology can be implemented on furnaces using gas, heavy oil, or the mixing of the two energies. Combustion control is provided by:\n\nminimising excess air through a reduction of the air for atomisation of fuel oil, special designs of socket plates, elimination of cold air entrances and maintenance of furnaces;\nreducing the fuel/air mixing rate in particular through the optimisation of the number, the types and the positions (angles) of injectors in the port.\n\nThe technique also includes a review of the furnace control system and the installation of monitoring methods for certain furnace parameters. In particular, oxygen probes are installed at the top of the regenerator chambers to provide better control of excess air levels.\n\nThe main characteristics of the FENIX technique are described in the patent application  and the evolutions since 1998 are under patent registration.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe FENIX process allows the continuous stabilisation of NOX emissions of between 700 and 800 mg/Nm3. For example, NOX emissions of the Stolberg plant, that runs a cross-fired float glass furnace (see Figure   4 .36 below) have been stabilised below 800 mg/Nm3 since February 2005, which correspond to a specific emission coefficient of less than 1.7 kg of NOX per tonne of molten glass.\n\n\nFigure 4.36:\tNOX emissions from the FENIX process\n\n\nCross-media effects \nAt the time of writing this document (2010), the cross-media effects had not been evaluated.\n\nOperational data\nAs reported in the Glass BREF adopted in 2001, the first trial in the Aniche plant (France), at that time running with fuel oil, had been carried out following the modifications to the combustion system as described in the patent application  and had shown a performance of 510 - 580 mg/Nm3 (1.25 kg of NOX/tonne of molten glass) during a short period of tests. This furnace is now (2010) operating with 60 % gas and 40 % heavy oil and the NOX emissions have been stabilised consistently at a higher value than the one that was reached during tests, and are in the range of 700 - 800 mg/Nm3. \n\nIn the meantime, the Fenix process had also been applied to other furnaces with the same range of emissions (between 700 and 800 mg/Nm3) being achieved. \n\nApplicability\nThe FENIX process requires careful application by a specialised team. It has been fully developed on at least nine furnaces of Saint-Gobain Glass in Europe. The technique can be available for float processes when directly integrated during the design and construction of the furnace. \n\nSaint-Gobain Glass stated in 2001 that they were ready to grant a non-exclusive licence under the FENIX technology to other glassmakers, provided that an agreement could be reached on the conditions of such a licence. However, the application of this technique requires a previous study of the furnace to be carried out by the supplier; this necessity could make the application to other glassmakers very difficult because of confidentiality issues. \nAt the time of writing this document (2010), this technique has only been applied to cross-fired regenerative furnaces and, due to its specificities, it is improbable that it could be extended to other furnace technologies. \n\nThe trends of the first results obtained in the Aniche plant that had been reported inside the Glass BREF of 2001 were reproduced on other furnaces, using other fuels, allowing for the conclusion that the NOX emission ranges of 700 - 800 mg/Nm3 could be stabilised consistently. \n\nEconomics \nThe capital costs, including the furnace modifications (upper cost of refractories), the new burners and the improved control systems amount to approximately EUR 1.5 million for the application to an existing furnace operating with at least part of the energy supply as fuel oil. For a new plant or rebuild, the extra costs would be lower, at around EUR 1 million.

For this reason it is important to consider all the primary techniques described in this document as a package rather than simply as individual techniques. However, for clarity, the techniques have necessarily been described separately, but consequential effects have been discussed where possible. A low level of emissions from material carryover is achieved by maintaining a level of moisture in the raw materials and by controlling the batch blanket coverage, particle size, gas velocity and burner positioning. For those processes which require dry batch materials, and/or very fine batch materials, dust emissions from carryover may be slightly higher. \n\nHowever, the contribution to the overall emissions will still be minor compared to the volatile species contribution. Issues relating to dust arising from material charging are dealt with in Section 4.3 above.\n\nBecause the dust emissions arise mainly from volatile species, the primary abatement techniques discussed here concentrate on this source. From dust analyses of soda-lime furnaces, it can be concluded that sodium species are the major components leading to dust formation in flue-gases. Volatile species from the batch (e.g. NaCl) and from the melt (e.g. NaOH) react with sulphur oxides to form sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) which condenses in the waste gas below 1100 degC. In most cases, sodium sulphate is used as the fining agent. The dissociation of the sodium sulphate in the molten glass leads to sulphur oxide concentrations, which are much higher than the sodium component concentrations in the combustion chamber and in the flue-gases. With respect to Na2SO4 formation, the oxides of sulphur from fuel combustion or batch sulphate are available in stoichiometric excess compared to the volatilised sodium, which is the governing parameter for dust formation. The main sources of sodium are the cullet or soda ash and, to a minor extent, sodium sulphate. However, the use of high amounts of sodium sulphate in the batch composition causes an increase in dust emissions.\n\nIn very sulphur-lean gases, sodium chloride, sodium fluoride, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide particles can be formed during the cooling of the flue-gases to below 900 degC. This is not common, and can only occur when natural gas is used and when sodium sulphate is replaced by another fining agent, like antimony. This is never the case for container or flat glass but could happen in special applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of different volatilisation processes can be distinguished in soda-lime glass.\n\nReactive volatilisation from the molten glass surface. The sodium oxide (Na2O) in the silicate melt reacts at the surface with water vapour: Na2O (melt) + H2O - 2 NaOH (g). This type of volatilisation may be the major source of dust emissions in soda-lime glass furnaces.\nVolatilisation of the NaCl present as an impurity in synthetic soda. This volatilisation leads not only to sodium sulphate dust but also to HCl formation. \nVolatilisation of sodium sulphate from the surface of molten glass.\nReactive volatilisation by chemical reactions at the batch blanket surface with components in the furnace atmosphere. The water vapour in the combustion chamber is thought to be important for the reaction of soda ash to form sodium hydroxide vapours, with similar reactions for potassium compounds: Na2CO3 + H2O - 2NaOH(g) + CO2.\nVolatilisation of raw material components from the surface of the batch blanket (e.g. sand, feldspars, lime, soda ash, dolomite and sodium sulphate) is generally very low. Vapour pressures are very low below 1200 degC, and above 1000 degC; the single components have already reacted to form silicates.\nVolatilisation of sodium compounds in gas bubbles during the fining process is also of relatively minor importance.\nIn the case of the recycling of external cullet (container glass furnaces), emissions of lead components (PbO, PbCO3, PbSO4) might take place because of lead glass, mirror fragments and metallic lead contaminants in the cullet. This is not the case of soda-lime glass in the domestic sector where, in general, only internal cullet is used due to quality demands. In these cases, the level of cullet used in the batch formulation is process-dependent and can be limited. \n\nThe situation is different for other glass types. As already explained in Section 4.4.1, for boron glasses containing low alkali, reactive volatilisation is thought to be the main source of particulate matter. The composition of emitted dust varies significantly depending on the alkali content of the batch formulation and the fining agent. \n\nDust formation by volatilisation occurs very readily for glasses which contain boron and the concentration of unabated emissions is generally higher than for soda-lime glasses. In some cases they are more than ten times higher.\n\nThe types of volatilisation mechanisms described for soda-lime glass are the general basis of volatilisation in most other glasses, but clearly there is variation depending on the chemistry.\n\nThe most important factors affecting volatilisation are temperature, water vapour content in the furnace atmosphere, reducing gases just above the melt or batch blanket and the velocities of the gases at the surface of the melt. The availability of reactive species is also an important factor, particularly sodium and sulphates in soda-lime glass, and boron in boron glasses. However, this factor is often limited by the glass chemistry. \n\nA particular situation occurs when oxy-fuel combustion is applied for the melting process. The reduced flue-gas volume with lower flue-gas velocities and the significantly different composition of the combustion gases in contact with the glass melt (much higher concentration of water vapour and CO2) affect the volatilisation processes resulting, in general, in higher concentrations of the evaporated species and more aggressive furnace atmospheres; however, total dust emissions in terms of kg/tonne glass will often decrease, although this effect strongly depends on the furnace design, type and positioning of the burners.\n\nThe most important primary measures that can be taken to reduce dust emissions are outlined below.\n\nRaw material modifications\nSodium chloride can be a significant factor in emissions of dust and chlorides. It is used in some special glasses as a refining agent, but is more commonly present as a low level impurity in soda ash made by the Solvay process. Pressure from the glass industry has led soda ash producers to lower NaCl levels significantly (now generally around 1 kg/tonne). A further significant reduction in the short term would probably require further processing and therefore an increase in price. Natural soda ash is available which is virtually NaCl-free, but this material is generally more expensive in the European Union (EU) due to taxes and transport costs from the countries of origin. The main supply of natural soda ash comes from the US.\n\nIn most furnaces, the batch sulphate levels have been reduced to the minimum commensurate with good fining and maintaining the correct oxidation state of the glass. Alternatives to sodium sulphate can pose a greater environmental problem, e.g. arsenic and antimony-based fining agents. Further progress in this area is not expected to yield substantial emissions reductions. The limiting factor is thought to be the concentration of the sodium-containing vapours, but for gas-fired furnaces, very reduced sulphate concentrations would limit the reaction in the gas phase.\nIn glasses containing boron, the boron is essential to the forming of the products and the product characteristics. In recent years, substantial reductions have been made in boron levels, but further progress is becoming difficult without affecting the productivity, energy consumption and quality. Boron-containing materials are relatively expensive and every effort is made to reduce consumption. At the time of writing no credible alternatives to boron are available and the difficulties have led many operators to install secondary abatement techniques, particularly for glass wool and borosilicate furnaces. In general, abated dusts are recycled to the furnace.\n\nA number of companies in the continuous filament glass fibre sector have developed glass compositions that have low levels of boron and fluorine or only contain these elements due to trace levels in the raw materials. Emissions of particulate matter below 0.14 kg/tonne melted glass have been reported, to be compared with values of around 2 kg/tonne melted glass for formulations containing boron where no primary measures are applied, which demonstrate the importance of boron in the dust formation. This type of glass requires a higher melting temperature, is more difficult to fiberise, and the long-term effects on refractory life have yet to be determined. The details of the technique are proprietary, and therefore, although extremely promising, the technique cannot yet be considered as generally available. Progress varies between the different companies, but several of these formulations are now marketable.\n\nTemperature reduction at the melt surface\nThe surface temperature of the glass melt is an important factor in particulate formation, as more volatile species are generated at higher temperatures. A correlation between crown temperature, the glass melt surface temperature and particulate formation has been shown in soda-lime furnaces. Reduction of furnace temperature must be balanced with glass quality, the productivity of the furnace, and other environmental aspects such as the NOX concentration in the flue-gas. Measures which have the greatest effect in reducing dust emissions per tonne of glass are those which improve the energy efficiency and particularly the heat transfer to the glass. The main points are given below.\n\nFurnace design and geometry to improve convective currents and heat transfer. These modifications can only be implemented at the furnace rebuild. Larger furnaces are generally more energy efficient also resulting in lower emissions per tonne of glass.\nUse of electric boost which helps to reduce the crown temperature by putting energy directly into the melt and improving convective currents. The positioning of the electrodes is important, but this is difficult to change except at the furnace rebuild. The use of electric boost is usually limited by the cost of electricity.\nThe increased use of cullet which will reduce the melting energy requirement allowing operation at a lower temperature and lower fuel usage. Also, because cullet has already been melted its use helps to reduce the level of some of the volatile and reactive species, which contribute to dust formation, e.g. sodium chloride and batch sulphates. This is particularly relevant in oil or mixed oil/gas-fired furnaces where a reduction in the fuel requirement, due to the use of cullet, reduces SO2 levels. Cullet usage is limited by the availability of cullet at the correct quality, composition and affordability. For example, container glass furnaces use 5 - 95 % cullet (internal and external), soda-lime domestic glass and flat glass furnaces generally 10 - 40 % (usually only internal), and continuous filament glass fibre furnaces rarely use any cullet. \n\nBurner positioning\nAnother important factor in the rate of volatilisation from the melt is the rate of replacement of the gases above the melt. A high gas velocity or a high level of turbulence at the surface of the melt will increase the rate of volatilisation. Progress has been made with burner positioning to optimise combustion air velocity and direction, and fuel velocity and direction. Further work has also been carried out involving combining these changes with modifications to the furnace, with the aim of reducing the flue-gas velocity over the glass melt and batch blanket, with a reduced stripping effect on volatile components of the batch formulation. Changes that involve modifications to furnace design can only be implemented at furnace rebuild, and other changes are sometimes most effective when implemented with furnace redesign. When changing the positioning of the burners, it is important to avoid reducing flames touching the melt, since this would increase dust emissions and would promote refractory attack in the superstructure, with possible effects on the glass quality.\n\nConversion to gas firing (or very low sulphur oils)\nConversion from fuel oil firing to natural gas firing may give substantial reductions in dust emissions. The reasons for this are probably the particular condensation reactions for particulates with gas firing than with oil, although in some cases the reduced SOX levels might also be a factor. \n\nFor example, the flat glass sector has reported dust emission reductions in excess of 25 % for the conversion from oil to gas firing. The flat glass sector has also reported a significant effect from reducing the sulphur content of the oil (20 mg/Nm3 reduction in dust per 1 % reduction in oil sulphur content). A similar effect was observed in domestic glass with low sulphur oil (<1 %). Conversion to natural gas firing is discussed in more detail in Section 4.4.3.1. The main points are summarised below:\n\nthe majority of plants are already equipped to use either fuel, although some may not have access to a natural gas or a fuel oil supply;\ncosts of the technique will depend mainly on the prevailing fuel prices;\nthe lower emissivity of gas flame compared to fuel oil flames reduces the heat transfer to the melt and may increase energy consumption; \nnatural gas firing can result in higher NOX emissions compared with oil firing;\nsome cases of mixed combustion, using both types of fuels simultaneously in one furnace may enable reduced dust emissions without notably increasing the furnace energy consumption and NOX emissions.\n\nOther techniques\nEmissions from cold top electric furnaces can be minimised by reducing airflows and turbulence during charging, and by raw material grain size and moisture optimisation. Primary measures are rarely implemented for dust emissions from stone wool cupolas with the exception of the briquetting of the production waste added into the batch formulation. The main action that could be taken would be washing the raw materials to remove dust. However, most cupolas are fitted with bag filters and so there is little incentive to apply additional primary measures, because they are very unlikely to change the need for secondary measures.\n\nThe main advantages and disadvantages of primary techniques for the reduction of dust emissions are shown in Table   4 .86.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.86:\tMain advantages and disadvantages of primary techniques for dust reduction\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe emission levels achievable using primary techniques alone are difficult to quantify, because of the wide range of factors that can affect the results and the wide variation in furnace types and glass formulations.\n\nFor flame-fired furnaces, the lowest emission levels, using only primary abatement techniques, are achieved by furnaces producing soda-lime glasses. Average mass emissions are around 0.4 kg/tonne of glass melted, and the majority of the emission concentrations fall into the range of 100 - 300 mg/Nm3. There are some furnaces achieving less than 100 mg/Nm3 for dust, but these are not common. \n\nAt the time of writing, few plants have dust emission levels of below 100 mg/Nm3 without secondary abatement, and 100 - 200 mg/Nm3 (<=0.4 kg/tonne of glass) is considered currently achievable with primary measures. \n\nIt is unlikely that these figures could be achieved for compositions other than soda-lime glass. In general, for other compositions the optimisation of primary techniques could be expected to reduce emissions by 10 - 30 % of the starting value associated with a condition when no specific measures are applied to limit dust emissions.\n\nPrimary measures combined with secondary measures (filtering systems, wet scrubbers) reduce the amount of dust to be removed from the flue-gases and to be recycled or disposed of.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn general, the techniques described prevent emissions without using additional chemicals/substances so the cross-media effects are assumed to be positive. However, a modification of the raw materials used for the preparation of the batch composition, with the scope of reducing volatile components, could result in an increase of specific energy consumption. For instance, the addition of water to the batch composition to suppress carryover or the substitution of a raw material with one less volatile but requiring a higher melting temperature normally results in an increase of energy consumption. A temperature reduction at melt surface might affect the quality of glass, leading to higher rates of rejected finished articles and higher specific energy consumption per unit of saleable product. A different positioning of the burners applied to minimise volatilisation phenomena might cause a decrease in the energy efficiency of the furnace with a consequent increase of specific emissions from combustion; in addition, a modification of the evaporation/condensation phenomena of the deposited salts may occur with potential damage to the refractories exposed to the flue-gas.\n\nThe conversion from fuel oil firing to natural gas firing is normally associated with an increase of NOx emissions and specific energy consumptions. \n\n\n\nOperational data\nIncluded in the descriptions.\n\nApplicability\nThe techniques described are considered to be generally applicable to all parts of the industry within the constraints identified. However, techniques successfully implemented in one furnace may not have the same effects for other furnaces. The reduction achieved will depend on the starting level of dust emissions. Moreover, the introduction of more than one of the techniques presented in this section will not necessarily provide a cumulative level of reduction.\n\nIn the short to medium term, primary measures for dust abatement are likely to achieve more significant reductions for soda-lime formulations than for other glass types. An exception may be represented by the continuous filament glass fibre produced with low or boron-free formulations.\n\nEconomics\nVery little information is available on the costs of primary techniques, but the industry has reported that the costs of the measures implemented to date (2010) are considered to be low. Indeed those techniques that reduce energy usage may result in cost savings. \n\nPrimary measures can involve varying costs depending on the level and time scale of the application. The measures are an overall package and it is the optimisation of the package that determines the costs and results. For example, the use of low chloride or natural soda ash is unlikely to reduce dust emissions to levels comparable to secondary abatement, and depending on other factors the costs may be disproportionate to the benefits. However, it is one aspect of the package of measures, the costs and results of which, must be considered as a whole.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe implementation of primary measures for the reduction of dust emissions is often based on economic and operational benefits deriving from the application of the selected techniques, such as avoiding the clogging of regenerators, corrosion or damage of the materials, reducing volatilisation and the consequent loss of valuable raw materials, etc. \n\nExample plants\nThe application of some of the primary techniques described in this section is common within the glass industry.\n\nReference literature   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3293229_abstract", "x": 0.47403407, "y": 0.3296943, "title": "ADDITIVES TO IMPROVE OPEN-TIME AND FREEZE-THAW CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER-BASED PAINTS AND COATINGS", "year": 2018, "text": "Waterborne coatings are described having an acceptable balance of properties both during the storage of coating, application and drying.

Electric melting has important effects on pollutant emissions and so is also discussed in this chapter as a 'primary' abatement measure.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe complete replacement of fossil fuels in the furnace eliminates the formation of combustion products at the installation level (but electricity generation should be accounted for); namely, oxides of sulphur (when fuel oil is used), thermal NOX, and carbon dioxide (CO2) The remaining emissions arise from particulate carryover and the decomposition of batch materials, particularly CO2 from carbonates, NOX from nitrates and SOX from sulphates. In most cases where electric melting is applied, sulphate use in the batch composition is quite low, since the use of other refining and oxidising agents is more common (e.g. nitrates).\n\nThere may also be low levels of halide emissions, e.g. hydrogen fluoride (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)), or metals where these substances are present in the raw materials. However, emissions can be significant from formulations with added fluorides. The emissions of all volatile batch components are considerably lower than in conventional furnaces due to the reduced gas flow and the absorption, condensation and reaction of gaseous emissions in the batch blanket which usually covers the whole surface of the melt.\n\nThe furnaces are usually open on one side and there are significant air currents due to the gaseous emissions and the heat from the melt. It is usually necessary to provide some form of ventilation to allow dust, gases and heat to escape without entering the work place. This is achieved either by natural draught or by extraction. The waste gas emitted by natural draft will have a very low volume but may have a high dust concentration, and poor dispersion characteristics.\nDust emissions can be controlled by extraction to a dust abatement system, which due to the low volumes involved is usually a bag filter. This arrangement results in very low dust emissions and also allows for the treatment of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions by dry scrubbing if necessary. See Sections 4.4.1.3 and 4.4.3.\n\nThe actual emissions achieved will depend greatly on the batch formulation, and due to the low waste gas flows, a comparison of emission concentrations can be misleading. However, as a broad indication, overall direct emissions are reduced by a factor of between 10 and 100 compared to a conventional air-fuel-fired furnace of comparable pull rate. Some actual quantitative data are given in Section 3.8.2.2 for mineral wool installations, and in the example installations presented in this document. \n\nCross-media effects\nDirect emissions from the furnace are greatly reduced using electric melting and the thermal efficiency is very high. However, when considering the overall environmental performance of the technique, the environmental impact of power generation can offset most of the advantages. A full quantitative analysis is impossible within the scope of this document. The environmental issues associated with electricity generation are very complex, and differ widely across the European Union (EU) and sometimes between installations. \n\nElectricity can be supplied from the national supply or from a local or dedicated supply, which can affect both the cost and the efficiency of supply. If the power is taken from the national grid network, it can be from a wide variety of sources. Power generation from coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro and other renewable sources all have very different environmental issues associated with them. \n\nThe difference in thermal efficiency between electric melting and fossil fuel melting is also reduced when the efficiency of electricity generation is considered (primary energy). \n\nAgain it depends very much on the source of electricity, but for a traditional fossil fuel-fired power plant, the efficiency from primary fuel to point of electricity use is in the region of 30 - 35 %. For a combined cycle natural gas turbine plant, the figure would be closer to 50 %.\n\nIndirect emissions of CO2 and NOXx associated with the production of electric energy have been estimated for a small furnace producing 20 tonnes/day of non-lead crystal glass. In this particular case, the reduction of 14 tonnes/year of NOX emissions, achieved by switching from a fossil fuel-fired furnace to electric melting furnace, is completely offset by the amount of indirect emissions accounted for in the production of electricity, equivalent to 15 - 16 tonnes NOX/year and 6 300 tonnes/year of indirect CO2 emissions. This is not always the case; for lead crystal glass furnaces, the net NOX and CO2 emissions (indirect + direct emissions) are slightly lower for the electric furnace than for the fossil fuel-fired one, but the difference between the two is rather small.  \n\nDue to the low waste gas volumes associated with the technique, the cost of any downstream abatement equipment is greatly reduced and the low volumes of collected dust can be readily recycled. The low volatile loss also reduces the consumption of raw materials, which reduces both emissions and costs. This is particularly beneficial for some of the more expensive and/or toxic components such as lead oxides, fluorides, arsenic compounds, borax, etc. \n\nOperational data\nIn general, electric melting produces a very homogenous high quality glass, in particular, in the case of special glasses in which batch formulations contain volatile components. For some domestic and special glass applications, this can be one of the primary reasons for choosing electric melting.\n\n\nHowever, cold-top electric furnaces have a smaller operating tonnage 'window' than conventional furnaces. For example, a 40 tonnes/day cold-top electric furnace would typically operate well between 36 - 44 tonnes/day. When a lower tonnage is required for a specific machine production rate, the electric furnaces are difficult to control, and the higher pull must be maintained (side drain); therefore, more glass is being melted than the required amount for production needs, resulting in higher production costs. On the contrary, a 40 tonnes/day conventional furnace could operate at 25 - 30 tonnes/day, if needed, with very few problems.\n\nThe traditional view within the glass industry is that sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate are required in cold-top electric furnaces to provide the necessary oxidising conditions for a stable, safe and efficient manufacturing process. The use of nitrates directly affects the emissions of NOX and although not necessary for all applications, this can reduce some of the environmental benefits of electric melting. The use of nitrates as oxidising agents becomes more important where waste material which contains organic compounds is recycled to the melter. The use of high external cullet levels (or other recycled materials) can sometimes cause odour problems.\n\nA summary of the main advantages and disadvantages associated with the application of electric melting is shown in Table   4 .83:\n\n\nTable 4.83:\tMain advantages and disadvantages of electric melting\n\n\nAn example installation is presented in Table   4 .84 for the production of domestic glass, particularly crystal and lead crystal.\n\n\nTable 4.84:\tExample installation for the application of electric melting in the domestic glass sector (crystal and lead crystal glass) \n\n\nApplicability\nElectric melting is applicable in many parts of the glass industry and is used in several sectors including high temperature insulation wools, mineral wool, special glass, domestic glass and, to a lesser extent, in container glass generally for low tonnages for the production of flaconnage. Electric melting can clearly only be installed at a furnace rebuild. There are no known full-scale examples of electric melting in the flat glass or frits sectors. The technique is commonly used for the production of potentially highly volatile, polluting glasses (e.g. lead crystal and opal glass) and for high value added products.\n\nThe wider use of the technique is limited by the operating costs and by some technical considerations. As discussed above, the main constraint is the operating cost and, depending on a range of factors, this sets an upper size limit on the economic viability. \n\n\n\nAt the time of writing the document (2010), the technique is not in use for large volume glass production (>300 tonnes per day) and so cannot be considered fully proven either technically or economically. The application of electric melting to the production of continuous filament glass fibre is not considered to be currently economically or technically viable, since E-glass often used for this type of product has a low alkali content resulting in very low electrical conductivity. \n\nAn experimental float glass line with an electrically heated furnace was in operation in the UK from 1989 to 2000. This plant was built to demonstrate the principle of cold top electric melting for float glass production. The plant has operated successfully on this pilot scale and it has been used to produce a range of exotic glasses, the emissions from which would have been very difficult to control from a conventionally-fired furnace. The application demonstrated that operating a full-scale float glass line (>500 tonnes per day) with an all-electric furnace is not currently economically viable due to the high operating costs. The furnace is no longer in operation.\n\nEconomics\nThe economic viability of electric melting depends mainly on the price differential between electricity and fossil fuels. At the time of writing (2010), average electricity costs per unit of energy are 4 to 5 times the cost of fuel oil. Electricity costs can vary by up to 100 % between Member States, but fossil fuel prices tend to show less difference. Fuel prices and their variations are discussed in Section 4.4.3.1. Electric furnaces are very thermally efficient; in general, they are 2 to 4 times better than air-fuel-fired furnaces. The comparison for large, energy efficient furnaces is at the lower end of this range, and for smaller furnaces at the upper end. \n\nElectric furnaces have much lower capital costs than conventional furnaces which, when annualised, partially compensate for the higher operating costs. However, the furnaces have shorter campaign lives before they require rebuild or repair, i.e. 2 to 7 years compared to 10 to 20 years for conventional furnaces. The electric furnace can be more competitive in the range of 10 to 50 tonnes/day, because of the higher specific heat losses of air-fuel furnaces.\n\nGeneral conclusions on the costs of electric melting versus fossil fuel-fired melting cannot be made; all cost considerations need to be done on a case-specific basis since several parameters need to be taken into account (location, different energy sources and prices, furnace capacity, production flexibility, furnace lifetime, glass quality to be achieved, stability of the process, etc.), in particular when comparing all electric furnaces to regenerative, recuperative and oxy-fired furnaces. \n \nAs an example, the comparison between an all-electric melting furnace of about 30 tonnes/day, in the tableware/crystal glass sector, and a recuperative unit melter furnace shows that the electric furnace requires a higher investment cost of about EUR 3 million, due to its shorter lifetime, but lower operating costs (EUR 350 000 less). In this particular case, slightly lower costs per tonne of molten glass are reported.\nBased on current practice, the following is proposed as a very general indicative guide to the size of electrical furnaces which may be viable, i.e. those which can potentially be a practicable alternative (there are inevitably exceptions due to local circumstances):\n\nFurnaces below 75 tonnes per day are generally viable.\nFurnaces in the range 75 - 150 tonnes per day may be viable in some circumstances.\nFurnaces greater than 150 tonnes per day are generally unlikely to be viable.\n\nThe financial considerations can also be greatly affected by site-specific factors including: prevailing energy costs; product quality requirements, available space, costs of alternative abatement measures, prevailing legislation; ease of operation; and the anticipated operating life of alternative furnaces.\n\nIn those Member States where the price difference between fossil fuels and electricity is at the upper end of the range given, the option of electric melting may appear less attractive. In such cases this could lead the operator to select a combination of other techniques in preference to electric melting.\n\nWhen using electric furnaces, the emissions of CO2 associated with the melting process are low, since they only arise from the batch composition. The related operational costs would hardly be affected by the cost of CO2 emission allowances needed to cover the furnace emissions (European Directives 2003/87/EC and 2009/29/EC establishing an Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emissions); however, an indirect effect on the cost of electricity, due to the the generator passing on European Union (EU)-Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) costs, should be considered.\n\nWhether or not electric furnaces can be considered more 'carbon' efficient will depend on the source of electricity.\n\nAn example installation, presenting the costs associated with the electric melting technique applied to the production of special, borosilicate glass is given in Table   4 .85.\n\n\nTable 4.85:\tExample installation for the application of electric melting in the special glass sector\n\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe thermal efficiency of an electric furnace is better than the equivalent conventional furnace.

The continuous nature of glass wool production requires the use of a cleaning mechanism to prevent the build-up of sticky organic material and fibre in the extraction ducting and in the fan. The normal technique applied is in-duct water spraying, which can take various forms. The discontinuous nature of stone wool cupola production (campaigns of one to three weeks) provides the opportunity to clean the ducting if required. Also stone wool production involves relatively less binder usage per unit volume of product and so the build-up is slower. Some stone wool processes utilise water sprays in the forming area, but this is largely due to operator preference or to site-specific operating requirements.\n\nWhere water sprays are used to clean ducting, it is logical to optimise their use to also clean the waste gas. In this situation, the two objectives are entirely complementary; the more material removed from the waste gas, the more effective the cleaning function. The systems have generally been adapted beyond the minimum necessary to prevent unacceptable build-up in the ducting. Within the sector, the term 'impact jets' is used to describe this optimised technique.\n\nIn order to optimise the efficiency of gas cleaning, the systems can apply the water in high volume and at a high pressure, but this does not produce a significant pressure drop. The design of the impact jets will differ between processes but is intended to optimise the efficiency of the technique, for both duct cleaning and waste gas scrubbing. To remove the entrained water from the waste gas, impact jets are always combined with cyclones (or other devices), which also have an effect on particulate levels depending on the design as described in Section 4.4.1.4.\n\nParticulate and droplet removal will occur by impaction/impingement and to a lesser extent by diffusion. Some systems may involve a narrowing of the duct to improve the removal efficiency, but the particulate removal efficiency is predominantly dependent on pressure drop, which is low for all these systems. In general, due to the low pressure drop in the system, the removal efficiency for fine particulate matter and droplets is quite low, while large particles and fibres are well removed. \n\nGaseous substances will be partially absorbed by contact with the water. The efficiency of gas absorption depends on the difference between the partial pressure of the gas in the waste gas stream and the vapour pressure of the gas in the liquid, the solubility of the gas in the liquid,the surface area for contact, and to a lesser extent the contact time. There will also be a condensation effect, which can be important if the waste gas is warm. \n\nProcess water is usually used for impact jets and already contains most of the substances present in the gas stream in varying quantities. This will particularly affect the efficiency of gaseous substance removal. The recycling process water is filtered before it is reapplied but will contain significant levels of soluble materials. The system is in dynamic equilibrium, and the process water system is described later in this document.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nThe use of impact jets and cyclones allows for an easy removal of the solid material which is present in significant amounts in the flue-gases of the forming area in quite large and fibrous form. However, due to a low efficiency for the removal of fine particles, cyclones and impact jets are mainly used as a pretreatment technique. The final emissions are very dependent on the binder and process water chemistry and on the amount of binder applied. \n\nCross-media effects \nUnless another technique such as packed bed scrubbing is used, cyclones (or sometimes an alternative device) are incorporated with impact jets to remove entrained water. This is necessary to reduce water consumption and to achieve acceptable levels of plume visibility and dispersion. \nWhere other wet techniques are used (e.g. wet ESPs or packed bed scrubbing), impact jets are generally used upstream.\n\nOperational data\nThe results that are achieved using this technique are given in Table   4 .121.\n\n\n\n\nApplicability\nIn principle, this technique is applicable to all glass wool and stone wool processes. It is not used in many stone wool plants because it is not deemed necessary for process cleaning, and could adversely affect other abatement techniques being used. For forming area emissions, impact jets and cyclones are used in approximately 90 % of glass wool plants and 10 % of stone wool plants.\n\nEconomics \nCosts for this technique are given in Table   4 .122 and depend largely on the airflow and plant size. The costs of the technique as an abatement measure are difficult to assess, because where impact jets are used, some form of cleaning mechanism is an inherent requirement of the process. The costs given in the table represent the total cost for the system. There are no examples of systems being implemented just to clean ducting; they are always installed for the dual purpose. It is estimated that the gas cleaning element represents 60 % of the total cost. However, this analysis is somewhat theoretical, because in most Member States, completely unabated emissions would not be permitted and other abatement costs would be incurred.\n\nDriving force for implementation \nIn the forming area, a significant amount of the solid material is quite large and fibrous, and this can easily be removed by the impact jets and cyclones, especially for glass wool production.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique is so widely applied that it is not useful to specify example plants.\n\nReferences to literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2870991_abstract", "x": 0.69603974, "y": 0.37487754, "title": "Inlet for scrubber", "year": 2015, "text": "The objective of the present invention is to provide new inlet structure that minimizes the clog phenomena of the inlet for wet type scrubber and that can use the inlet for long term without exchanging.According to the object described above, the present invention includes a second cleanser buffer (400) of hollow pillar shape that also becomes the passage for gas; and includes a first cleanser buffer (250) equipped with cleanser entries (310, 320) on upper part of the second cleanser buffer and with the entries (210, 220) for nitrogen or inert gas, the cleanser entries equipped at the first cleanser buffer are to be installed facing each other including the 2 entries, designed for the cleanser flow down spinning along the wall of the second cleanser buffer after the cleanser is made to enter toward the tangential component against the wall of the second cleanser buffer, and the two of the cleanser entries are facing opposite direction to let the cleanser go out in opposite direction are the characteristics of the inlet of this scrubber.

Whilst the basic technology for both of these is similar, the design criteria for particulate or gas removal are very different. However, to keep down capital costs, wet scrubbing systems are often used to control mixed emissions of particulates and gases. The design is inevitably a compromise, but may represent Best Available Techniques (BAT) where separate control systems are prohibitively expensive. Wet scrubbing is a well-documented technique and only the main principles and the issues specific to this sector are discussed here.\n\nParticle collection by liquid scrubbing occurs by three main mechanisms: inertial impaction, interception and diffusion. Trace gas removal by wet scrubbing occurs by absorption and, to a lesser extent, condensation. Absorption involves mass transfer between a soluble gas and a solvent in a gas-liquid contacting device.\n\nThe particle collection efficiency of wet scrubbers is strongly dependent on the total energy usage, particularly on the pressure drop across the collection zone. If the liquid is evenly dispersed within the scrubber, similar pressure drops will often give similar efficiencies on the same dust for quite different scrubber designs. Thus, it is not possible to design a wet scrubber which has high efficiencies on particles of 1 mm and below, and which does not have a high pressure drop. High energy scrubbers can give good collection efficiencies for particles of <0.5 mm, but the high running costs mean that alternative techniques may be more economical.\nThe efficiency of gas absorption depends on the difference between the partial pressure of the soluble gas in the waste gas stream and the vapour pressure of the gas in the liquid, the solubility of the gas in the liquid, the surface area for contact, and, to a lesser extent, the contact time. There will also be a condensation effect, which can be important if the waste gas is warm. Solubility obviously depends on the gas and the liquid. Water is suitable for absorbing soluble acidic gases such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, silicon hexafluoride, and for ammonia. Alkaline or acid solutions are suitable for absorbing less soluble gases, and in some applications, oxidising solutions can control organic odours. The surface area is determined by the packing material or droplet size.\nPacked bed scrubbers consist of an outer shell which contains a bed of packing material on support grids, liquid distributors, gas and liquid inlets and outlets, and a mist eliminator. Liquid is distributed continuously over the packing material forming a film, which provides a large surface area for gas/liquid contact. The dirty gas stream flows through the packed bed and the liquid and gas flow may be countercurrent, concurrent or cross-current. There are various types of packing material, which can be packed in random or regular arrangements. The liquid film over the packing material provides a large surface area for mass transfer. Countercurrent packed bed absorbers maximise the driving force for absorption because gas leaving the packed bed encounters fresh absorbing liquid. Packed beds can become blocked by insoluble particulate matter, scale and biological growth.\n\nIn some applications, venturi scrubbers may be considered. The characteristic feature of a venturi scrubber is the constriction to the duct (venturi throat) causing an increase in gas velocity. Liquid is introduced to the scrubber and forms a film on the walls, which is atomised by the gas stream in the venturi throat. The efficiency of the venturi scrubber depends on the pressure drop, and consequently, they have high power consumption and operating costs. Venturi scrubbers are generally the most efficient wet scrubbing devices for particle collection, because they are suitable for submicron particles. They can also be used for trace gas removal, but efficiency is limited by low contact time.\n\nThe most commonly used wet scrubbers within the sector are packed bed scrubbers, usually with impact jets upstream. The impact jets remove the larger particulate matter and so help to prevent blocking of the packing. Some operators have installed ionising wet scrubbers (Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS)), which are intended to combine the advantages of the low capital cost of wet scrubbers, with the low operating costs of electrostatic precipitators. The Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS) is basically a packed bed scrubber maintained in a neutral charge condition and preceded by an ionising section to charge the particles. The bed is normally composed of plastic packing. Gas velocities through the bed are low so as to ensure that the particles spend as much time as possible close to the packing elements.\n\nWhen the waste gas from the forming area comes into contact with water in an efficient scrubbing system, the following events will occur:\n\na proportion of the entrained particulate matter, predominantly the larger particles and droplets will be held in suspension;\na proportion of any soluble resinous material will be absorbed by the water;\nthe volatile substances will form an equilibrium between the gaseous and aqueous phases.\n\nProcess water is the most commonly used scrubber liquor within the sector. This presents the potential problem of maintaining sufficiently low concentrations of volatile materials in the scrubbing medium to facilitate efficient absorption, and to prevent release back to the gas phase. The mineral wool manufacturing process is a net consumer of water, and the performance of the scrubber can be improved by introducing the clean water top up into the system in the scrubber. This benefit can be optimised by using a combined multistage scrubbing process with the water flowing from stage to stage countercurrent to the gas stream. In this way, the dirtiest water is used to scrub the incoming (dirtiest) gas stream and clean water is used in the final scrubbing stage. A description of a typical water circuit for the production of glass wool is presented in Figure 2.11, Section 2.9.1.\n\nA possible solution to the problem would be to separate the scrubbing medium from the process water system and either use clean water with a sufficiently high purge to maintain efficient absorption or to chemically dose the scrubber liquor with substances that would react with the volatile species. However, there are important limitations to both of these approaches. The use of a clean water system for achieving a substantially better performance would cause the volume of the purge would be too great to recycle to the process water system, and would give rise to a new waste stream requiring separate treatment. The volume of water coming from the impact jets would exacerbate this problem.\nThe water content and resinous nature of the substances contained in waste gas would cause blocking and scrubber liquor volume problems in a chemical scrubber unless a high volume purge is used. Due to the chemical content, none of this could be recycled to the process water system, again giving rise to a new waste stream requiring separate treatment. A further complication is that the chemical reagents necessary to remove phenol/formaldehyde and ammonia are incompatible and would require separate stages. Chemical scrubbing stages could be positioned in series with a process water scrubber, but this would greatly increase costs and unless it is extremely efficient, would not overcome the problems discussed. Also, when the aqueous waste stream is considered, the difference in overall emissions between such a technique and a process water scrubber with good process control is likely to be limited.\n\nMultistage scrubbing either in a combined unit or in separate units is, in theory, a potential option for the forming area and for combined forming and curing oven emissions. However, no mineral wool processes operate multistage scrubbers and so no information is available on their environmental performance, costs or potential operating problems. Therefore, the technique cannot currently be considered fully available. It could, however, be considered an option if line emissions are very high at a particular installation.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nThe emission levels achievable with packed bed scrubbers (with process water as the scrubber liquor) in the mineral wool industry are given in Table   4 .121.\n\nCross-media effects \nAn important consideration for wet scrubbers is the potential cross-media effect of creating an aqueous waste stream that requires treatment. In the mineral wool sector, this problem has been avoided by using process water as the scrubbing medium with 100 % recycling to the process water system. The use of clean water or chemical scrubbers would result in an aqueous waste stream (see Section 2.9.1, Figure 2.11).\n\nOperational data\nThe removal efficiency is limited for particulate matter by the low pressure drop, and for gaseous substances by the use of process water as the scrubbing medium. Significantly lower emission levels for phenol, formaldehyde and ammonia would be expected with clean water scrubbing. The process water equilibrium is a critical factor and it is possible in some rare instances (e.g. a low binder product following a sustained period on a high binder product) that the efficiency of the scrubber could be negative for gaseous components.\n\nSeveral operators have used ionising wet scrubbers in recent years, but overall results have been disappointing. Improvements in efficiency over packed bed scrubbers have generally been less than 10 %.\n\nThere is no experience of chemical or multistage scrubbing in this sector but experience in the chemical industry suggests that emissions of below 10 mg/Nm3 could be readily achieved for phenol, formaldehyde and ammonia, if the associated problems could be overcome. Compared with the data shown in Table   4 .121, this only represents a significant improvement for ammonia.\n\nApplicability\nIn principle, packed bed scrubbers circulating process water are applicable to all processes within the sector. The technique is not limited to new plants or substantial modifications, but costs are likely to be higher for existing installations. In some applications, particularly stone wool, other techniques can be used to achieve similar or lower emission levels.\n\n\n\nIn glass wool production, slightly less than 20 % of installations use packed bed scrubbers, either for combined forming area and curing oven emissions or just for the forming area. In stone wool production, packed bed scrubbers are used for approximately 10 % of installations for forming area emissions and the same for the curing area. Emissions from the two areas are not generally combined in stone wool installations.\n\nEconomics\nCosts for this technique are given in Table   4 .122 and depend largely on airflow and plant size. Incorporation of an ionising stage as in the ionising wet scrubber (Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS)) involves an increase in capital costs of approximately 75 %, and an approximate 10 % increase in operating costs. Multistage chemical scrubbing could be expected to cost up to twice the totals given in the table. The cost of a combined multistage scrubber would probably be more comparable to the Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS) system. However, it would be necessary to completely separate the stages, which would add to the cost, and more expensive corrosion-resistant materials may be necessary.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nA benefit of this technique is the opportunity to combine the forming area and curing oven emissions in a single treatment stage. The volume of the forming area waste gas is generally ten times greater than that of the curing oven. If implemented at the design stage, the combination of the waste gases does not add substantially to the overall cost of the technique.\n\nExample plants\nKnauf Insulation, St. Helens, UK\nURSA, Spain \nIsover Orange, France\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3219384_abstract", "x": 0.7135798, "y": 0.29913673, "title": "WALLS FOR CATALYTIC BEDS OF RADIAL- OR AXIAL-FLOW REACTORS", "year": 2017, "text": "Radial or axial-radial flow catalytic chemical reactor comprising a cylindrical shell (2) and at least one catalytic bed (5) and comprising a plurality of perforated tubes (10), said tubes having an open end (11) communicating with an inlet (3) of a gaseous flow of reagents in the reactor (2), said tubes being provided with a plurality of holes (14) on their side surface, said tubes (10) being arranged around the catalytic bed so as to form an outer wall (6) which bounds the catalytic bed and which distributes the reagents inside said bed; each of said tubes being formed by means of longitudinal or helical butt welding of a perforated strip (15).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.6.3.4\" title=\"Catalytic decomposition\">\n<references_to>2.6.12.2, 4.3.6.3</references_to>\n\n<content>\nCatalytic decomposition\n\nDescription\nThis technique consists in converting free chlorine to chloride and oxygen by using nickel-, iron- or cobalt-based catalysts. Catalytic decomposition can be carried out in fixed-bed reactors or with a catalyst slurry.\n\nTechnical description\nThe catalytic decomposition occurs according to the following overall reaction:\n\n2 NaOCl - 2 NaCl + O2|\n\nThis decomposition reaction generally occurs in hypochlorite solutions, albeit too slowly to remove free chlorine in technical systems. The reaction is accelerated by metal catalysts, lower pH values and higher temperatures (Section 2.6.12.2). Depending on the conditions, hypochlorite may instead decompose to chloride and chlorate (Section 4.3.6.3.5).\n\nSome systems operate with a catalyst slurry, which uses solutions of nickel, iron or cobalt compounds added to the waste water in stirred or agitated tanks . Metal concentrations are typically 20 mg/l . The high pH value of the solution causes the metal ions to precipitate as their hydroxides, which are then removed and regenerated. Alternatively, a fine dispersion of an insoluble metal compound can be used, which removes the need for the catalyst regeneration stage. In both cases, the catalyst must be allowed to settle before the supernatant water can be discharged, to avoid emissions of heavy metals. The reaction time combined with the settling of the catalyst takes several days . The catalyst activity decreases from batch to batch, although it is unclear whether this is due to deactivation of the catalyst or loss of metal .\n\nOther systems operate with the catalyst on a fixed-bed reactor (Figure   4 .42). The catalyst used is a nickel oxide promoted with iron on an alumina support. The design of the reactor is modular. The gravity-fed hypochlorite solution flows countercurrently with respect to the evolving oxygen , , .\n\n\nFigure 4.42:\tFlow diagram of a catalytic decomposition fixed-bed reactor process installed on the blowdown stream of a chlorine absorption unit\n\n\nCatalytic fixed-bed decomposition is often used as a single end-of-pipe technique (Figure   4 .42), but it can also be combined with chemical reduction. In this case, the outflow of the fixed-bed reactor is further treated with reducing agents. This technique is typically used for retrofitting plants which already use chemical reduction. Another possibility is to integrate the catalytic fixed-bed decomposition in the liquid recirculation loop of the chlorine absorption unit. The advantage of this process option is improved safety, due to a reduction of the recirculating hypochlorite , .\n\nIn some cases, it is possible to recycle the effluent from the reactor back to the brine system. It is then necessary to control the concentration of chlorate and other impurities, in particular for the membrane cell technique. Chlorate may be formed in the chlorine absorption unit, depending on the hypochlorite ion concentration in the caustic scrubber recirculation liquor and the temperature in the scrubber itself .\n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWith a catalytic fixed-bed reactor, a hypochlorite solution of up to 150 g/kg can be treated in a single pass to free chlorine levels of less than 1 mg/kg in the pH range of 9-14 at ambient pressure and temperatures of 10-60 degC. The outlet concentration essentially depends on the number of installed catalytic beds. Since the reactor has a fixed bed configuration, no emissions of metals occur, contrary to classic catalytic decomposition. The lifetime of the catalyst is reported to be several years. This technique also reduces the levels of hypobromite, but not of chlorate or bromate. Moreover, the produced oxygen (i.e. the intermediate atomic oxygen on the catalyst surface) may react with organic compounds, thereby reducing the chemical oxygen demand (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)) , , .\n\nCross-media effects\nA potential emission of heavy metals occurs in systems using a catalyst slurry. In systems with a fixed bed configuration, no emissions of heavy metals occur, as the catalyst is fixed in the bed. In both cases, the spent catalysts can usually be recycled. Otherwise, they become hazardous waste , .\n\nEconomics\nThe costs of a catalytic decomposition fixed-bed system will mainly depend on the quantity of free chlorine to be treated. Investment costs for a new decomposition unit were reported to be in the same order of magnitude as for a new chemical reduction unit. Operating costs are mostly linked to the catalyst, but also include electricity for pumps and steam for preheating, if necessary. A cost example is shown in Table   4 .80 . The flowrates and hypochlorite concentrations before treatment are typical for a plant with a chlorine capacity of approximately 100 kt/yr. The hypochlorite concentration after treatment is too high for discharges of the waste water to the environment or a sewerage system. The waste water therefore requires further treatment, if not recycled back to the brine system.\n\n\nTable 4.80:\tTypical operating costs for partial hypochlorite destruction using catalytic fixed-bed decomposition or chemical reduction\n\n\nExample plants\nFixed-bed catalytic decomposition has been installed in seven chlor-alkali plants worldwide since 1993 :\n\nShin-Etsu Chemicals in Naoetsu (Japan), chlorine capacity 45 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1993;\nSasol (formerly Polifin) in Sasolburg (South Africa), chlorine capacity 145 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1994;\nMitsui Toatsu in Nagoya (Japan), catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1996;\nSolvic in Jemeppe (Belgium), chlorine capacity 174 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1997;\nHanwha Chemical in Yeosu (South Korea), chlorine capacity 664 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 2005;\nTsurumi Soda in Yokohama (Japan), catalytic decomposition put into operation in 2008;\nShintech in Plaquemine, Louisiana (United States), chlorine capacity 418 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 2008 and 2010 (two units).\n\nBesides the above-mentioned chlor-alkali plants, the catalytic fixed-bed decomposition process has been installed at approximately 30 other industrial sites where there is a need for bleach destruction .\n\nReference literature\n, , , , , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4167421_abstract", "x": 0.69814324, "y": 0.2540266, "title": "DIRECT-CURRENT COUPLING HYDROGEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM AND CONTROL METHOD THEREFOR", "year": 2023, "text": "The present invention provides a direct-current coupling hydrogen production system and a control method therefor.

The residual hydrogen is further scrubbed with caustic soda and then used to produce steam. The scrubbing solution is recycled to the hypochlorite production unit .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of these techniques include:\n\nreduction of energy consumption;\nreduction of raw material consumption (if hydrogen would otherwise have to be produced by other techniques);\nreduction of hydrogen emissions (hydrogen could potentially act as an indirect greenhouse gas ).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nCurrent levels of emitted hydrogen as a share of the total hydrogen produced are presented in Section 3.4.6. On average, approximately 10 % of the hydrogen produced by chlor-alkali plants in the EU-27 and EFTA countries is emitted to the atmosphere. This corresponds to a use of 90 % of the co-produced hydrogen as a reagent or fuel .\n\nAt the Donau Chemie plant in Bruckl (Austria), the excess hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid production is treated for use as a fuel, resulting in savings of fuel oil of approximately 500 t/yr .\n\nCross-media effects\nSome raw materials and energy are consumed if additional equipment is required to increase the share of used hydrogen.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nAn increase in the quantity of used hydrogen may require the installation of new equipment or the extension of existing equipment. Existing equipment may need to be adapted, as burning hydrogen leads to high temperatures .\n\nThe amount of co-produced hydrogen depends on the chlorine production rate, which often varies over time (e.g. load-shedding, see Section 4.3.2.3.1). Any use of the co-produced hydrogen needs to be compatible with these fluctuations .\n\nDuring start-up and shutdown operations, the hydrogen produced usually does not have the required purity for its intended use. This is due to the fact that during plant shutdowns the relevant parts of the hydrogen network are flushed with nitrogen to prevent the formation of explosive gas mixtures (Section 3.4.7.1) , .\n\nEconomics\nThe production of steam or chemicals depends on the existence of a respective demand. Although membrane cell plants often consume steam to bring the caustic produced to the commercial concentration of 50 wt%, some have enough customers close to the production unit that directly use the 33 wt% caustic from the cells .\n\nBurning of the co-produced hydrogen to produce steam, which can then be used to generate electricity in gas turbines, requires considerable investments for boilers and turbines .\n\nIn the past, several companies bottled and marketed the co-produced hydrogen, but most of them have progressively sold this activity to specialised companies. In addition to the required investment (e.g. supplementary drying and purification of hydrogen, compressors, filling station, bottles) and operational costs, a commercial network with respective front- and back-offices, procedures for quality control, management of orders and deliveries, as well as accounting needs to be created. This is typically seen as unattractive for a 'non-core' business with a limited quantity of product compared to what industrial gas companies are handling .\n\nAt the Donau Chemie plant in Bruckl (Austria), the payback time for the installation to treat the excess hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid production for use as a fuel was less than one year .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation of these techniques include:\n\nreduction of costs related to energy consumption;\nreduction of costs related to equipment.\n\nExample plants\nAll chlor-alkali plants in the EU-27 and EFTA countries use hydrogen to various degrees as a chemical reagent or fuel.

Coatings are optimised in terms of mechanical and (electro-)chemical robustness, as well as low overpotentials \n.\n\nAt given anolyte conditions, a lower oxygen overpotential of a specific coating results in a lower production of chlorate. However, this does not change the current efficiency of the cells.

For a bipolar electrolyser operating at a current density of 6 kA/m2 and a current efficiency of 95 %, the chlorine production rate is 64 t/(m2*yr). The average lifetime of a membrane is approximately four years. This results in a total chlorine production of 256 t/m2 and specific membrane costs of EUR 2.0/t Cl2 produced which represents about 1 % of the total variable costs for an Electrochemical Unit. If the membrane lifetime decreases to three years, this specific cost becomes EUR 2.6/t Cl2 produced. For a monopolar membrane electrolyser operated at a current density of 3.5 kA/m2, the specific costs are much higher (EUR 3.4/t Cl2 produced). In practice, the aforementioned costs are double because the gaskets have to be simultaneously replaced with the membranes .\n\nWhen the costs for steam are higher than the costs for electricity, it is economically viable not to significantly reduce the cell voltage, since this would require compensation by additional heating of the brine with steam to maintain the operating temperature .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation of this technique include:\n\nreplacement of membranes at the end of their lifetime;\nreduction of costs related to energy consumption;\nincreased production rate;\nimprovement of product quality;\nreduction of costs related to equipment and maintenance.\n\n\nExample plants\nHigh-performance membranes are generally used by membrane cell plants.\nReference literature\n, , , , , , , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4209261_abstract", "x": 0.56742793, "y": 0.32278195, "title": "NANOFILAMENT-COATED MEMBRANES WITH HIERARCHICAL POROUS STRUCTURES, IN PARTICULAR FOR MEMBRANE DISTILLATION, AND METHODS FOR PREPARING THE SAME", "year": 2023, "text": "The invention relates to nanofilament-coated membranes with hierarchical porous structures comprising a microporous polymer support membrane having through-going pores with a nominal pore diameter in the range from 0.2 \u00b5m to 50 \u00b5m and a superhydrophobic fluorine-free nanoporous layer having through-going pores with a nominal pore diameter in the range from 5 nm to 200 nm provided on said support membrane and comprising or consisting of a porous network of polysiloxane nanofilaments.In more specific embodiments of said nanofilament-coated porous membranes, the microporous support membrane comprises or consists of a polymer which is selected from the group consisting of polyethersulfone (PES), cellulose acetate (CA), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (nylon), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) or polyethylene (PE).A second aspect of the invention relates to the use of these nanofilament-coated porous membranes for membrane distillation, in particular in a process of desalination of saline or distillation of contaminated water or extraction of water from waste water or extraction of other volatile components from a feed solution and to a device, in particular a membrane distillation device, comprising these nanofilament-coated porous membranes.A further aspect of the invention relates to a method for preparing these nanofilament-coated porous membranes.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.2.3.2\" title=\"High-performance membranes\">\n<references_to>2.4.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nHigh-performance membranes\n\nDescription\nHigh-performance membranes used in membrane cells show low voltage drops and high current efficiencies, while ensuring mechanical and chemical stability under the given operating conditions.\n\nTechnical description\nThe membrane is the most critical component of the membrane cell technique.

Membranes for monopolar electrolysers show higher voltage drops than those for bipolar electrolysers, due to the greater requirement for mechanical stability , , .\nThe electricity consumption of a membrane cell unit, as well as the formation of chlorate and oxygen, increases with the membrane age, due to the accumulation of impurities. If the brine purge rate is determined by the chlorate concentration, this may also lead to an increased consumption of water and salt , , .\n\nThe replacement of a membrane at the end of its service life by the best proven one compatible with the type of electrolyser used typically leads to electricity savings of <= 20 Alternating Current (AC) kWh/t Cl2 produced .\n\nCross-media effects\nSome raw materials and energy are consumed for the manufacture of the membranes. The use of high-performance membranes may require additional brine treatment, which in turn may lead to an additional consumption of energy and ancillary materials and to the generation of additional waste.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no restrictions to the use of high-performance membranes in new membrane cells. Existing membrane cells can often be retrofitted, depending on the availability of improved membranes from the respective equipment provider under the given conditions .\n\nIn some cases, the use of membranes with the lowest possible voltage drops is not possible due to insufficient chemical and/or mechanical strength .\n\nEconomics\nThe average cost for membranes is approximately EUR 500/m2. For a bipolar electrolyser operating at a current density of 6 kA/m2 and a current efficiency of 95 %, the chlorine production rate is 64 t/(m2*yr). The average lifetime of a membrane is approximately four years. This results in a total chlorine production of 256 t/m2 and specific membrane costs of EUR 2.0/t Cl2 produced which represents about 1 % of the total variable costs for an Electrochemical Unit. If the membrane lifetime decreases to three years, this specific cost becomes EUR 2.6/t Cl2 produced. For a monopolar membrane electrolyser operated at a current density of 3.5 kA/m2, the specific costs are much higher (EUR 3.4/t Cl2 produced). In practice, the aforementioned costs are double because the gaskets have to be simultaneously replaced with the membranes .\n\nWhen the costs for steam are higher than the costs for electricity, it is economically viable not to significantly reduce the cell voltage, since this would require compensation by additional heating of the brine with steam to maintain the operating temperature .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation of this technique include:\n\nreplacement of membranes at the end of their lifetime;\nreduction of costs related to energy consumption;\nincreased production rate;\nimprovement of product quality;\nreduction of costs related to equipment and maintenance.\n\n\nExample plants\nHigh-performance membranes are generally used by membrane cell plants.\nReference literature\n, , , , , , , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3173487_abstract", "x": 0.5706642, "y": 0.257284, "title": "DEVICE FOR DETECTION OF HALOGENATED HYDROCARBONS", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention provides a device for detection of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons which contains a carrier with at least one indicator of presence of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, and at least one haloalkane dehalogenase (EC 3.8.1.5) immobilized on the surface of said carrier.Further provided is a method of detecting at least one halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon in a sample or environment, wherein the sample or environment is contacted with said device which is pre-treated by hydration, and the chemical change of the indicator of presence of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons is evaluated.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.3.6\" title=\"Monitoring of halogenated organic compounds in water\">\n<references_to>4.3.3.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nMonitoring of halogenated organic compounds in water\n\nIssues of general relevance for all monitoring techniques are described in Section 4.3.3.2.\n\nDescription\nHalogenated organic compounds in effluents are usually measured as AOX (adsorbable organically bound halogens) and EOX (extractable organically bound halogens). These parameters are quantitative surrogate parameters, as described in the reference document on General Principles of Monitoring .\n\nTechnical description\nThe most commonly used method to measure AOX is the EN ISO 9562 standard. It is based on the adsorption of halogenated organic compounds on activated carbon, which is subsequently washed and burnt in pure oxygen. The hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide thus formed are absorbed in a solution and quantified by argentometry (e.g. by using microcoulometry). The method is applicable to test samples with AOX concentrations higher than 10 ug/l and chloride concentrations lower than 1 g/l . The use of this method for the analysis of waste water from chlor-alkali plants is impaired by the usually high chloride concentrations (Table   3 .22). The standard allows sample dilution, but the resulting AOX concentrations may then be lower than the application limits of the standard.\n\nAn alternative method is to measure the EOX, which is based on a liquid-liquid extraction of the halogenated organic compounds with a non-polar solvent such as hexane, which is subsequently burnt in an oxyhydrogen torch. The hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide thus formed are absorbed in a solution and quantified by argentometry (e.g. by using microcoulometry), photometry or by using ion-selective electrodes. The EOX method is not standardised on a European or international level, but some national standards in EU Member States exist, such as DIN 38409-H 4  and OENORM M 6614 .\n\nAnother alternative consists in using a modified AOX method, which is described in the informative Annex A of the EN ISO 9562 standard. In this method, the halogenated organic compounds are first separated from inorganic halides by using solid phase extraction with a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. The resulting extract is subsequently analysed according to the traditional AOX method. The modified AOX method tolerates chloride concentrations of up to 100 g/l .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn 2011, a comparison of the three aforementioned monitoring methods for halogenated organic compounds in waste water from a membrane cell plant was carried out (Table   4 .73).\n\n\nTable 4.73:\tConcentrations of halogenated organic compounds in waste water from a membrane cell plant using three different monitoring methods\n\n\nAs can be seen from the table, the traditional AOX method resulted in large variations in the concentrations of halogenated organic compounds over a three-day period (a factor of more than 10), while these variations were much smaller when the EOX or modified AOX method were used. These large variations are unusual for waste water discharges from chlor-alkali plants and are probably due to the high chloride concentrations of the samples. It seems as if chloride affected the measurements even though the samples were diluted prior to analysis.\n\nThe EOX measurements led to lower concentrations of halogenated organic compounds than the modified AOX method, very likely because only non-polar compounds are extracted from the aqueous phase.\n\nEconomics\nThe costs for the modified AOX method according to Annex A of EN ISO 9562 are approximately three times higher than for the traditional AOX method .\n\nExample plants\nIn Germany, regulatory measurements of halogenated organic compounds in chlor-alkali plants are carried out by using the AOX method according to EN ISO 9562 when chloride concentrations are below 5 g/l, and by using the modified AOX method according to the informative Annex A of EN ISO 9562 when chloride concentrations are above 5 g/l . In Austria, the modified AOX method according to Annex A of \nEN ISO 9562 has been used for waste water from chlor-alkali plants since 2012 .\n\nReference literature\n, , , ,\n, , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3035425_abstract", "x": 0.41806892, "y": 0.3283061, "title": "ELECTRODE CATALYST, COMPOSITION FOR FORMING GAS DIFFUSION ELECTRODE, GAS DIFFUSION ELECTRODE, MEMBRANE-ELECTRODE ASSEMBLY, AND FUEL CELL STACK", "year": 2016, "text": "Provided is an electrode catalyst that can exhibit sufficient performance, is suitable for mass production, and is suitable for reducing production costs, even when containing a relatively high concentration of chlorine.

The most common way to destroy the chlorine is to absorb it in weak caustic soda to produce sodium hypochlorite. The chemical reactions taking place are described in Section 2.6.12.2.\n\nThe absorption system can make use of batch or continuous systems, as well as of packed columns or ejectors :\n\nPacked columns are usually based on a countercurrent flow, with the chlorine gas entering the bottom of the column and the scrubbing solution entering the top. They have the advantage of larger scrubbing liquid retention volumes and good mass transfer. In case of emergencies, they can continue to absorb chlorine from a pressure relief system using scrubbing liquid stored in a gravity-fed head tank, even if the electricity supply fails. However, packed columns require an additional fan for sucking the chlorine vent and are more susceptible to plugging.\nEjectors based on the Venturi principle use a high-pressure liquid stream to create a vacuum which sucks the chlorine into the eductor where it reacts with the scrubbing solution. They have the advantage of being simple, as only one pump is needed for the scrubbing liquid transport and gas suction. In addition, they remain effective at low and high chlorine concentrations in the vent gases and are less sensitive to salt deposition. However, ejectors show high power consumption and the mass transfer is limited to a single stage per unit, so that multiple stages or a combination with packed columns are usually required to provide adequate chlorine removal.\n\nFigure   4 .40 provides an example of a possible layout of a chlorine absorption unit with two absorption columns, while Figure   4 .41 provides an example of an ejector system connected to an absorption column.\n\nFigure 4.40:\tFlow diagram of a possible layout of a chlorine absorption unit with two absorption columns\n\n\nFigure 4.41:\tFlow diagram of a possible layout of a chlorine absorption unit with an ejector system connected to an absorption column\n\n\nThe design of an absorption system requires clear specifications of:\n\nthe maximum quantity of chlorine;\nthe composition of the gas stream;\nthe maximum instantaneous flow.\n\nInformation on the composition of the gas stream includes temperature and pressure ranges, as well as the concentration ranges of other substances which may affect the process by, for example, reacting with the caustic soda (e.g. CO2), potentially forming explosive gas mixtures (e.g. H2) or altering the heat balance of the system (e.g. due to the condensation of water vapour from the gas stream, due to water evaporation from the scrubbing solution, and due to dilution with water) .\n\nIn general, the size of the chlorine absorption unit is not linked to the chlorine production capacity of the plant but instead to the gas flow, which is mainly defined by the flow of inert gas injected to keep the hydrogen concentration below the explosivity limits. The majority of the plants work with gas flows of 2 000-8 000 m3/h .\n\nThe proper design, maintenance and operation of the chlorine absorption unit are based on a risk assessment study to avoid the discharge of major amounts of chlorine to the atmosphere during all possible situations. This can be achieved by, depending on the technique :\n\nsizing of the absorption unit for a worst case scenario (derived from a risk assessment), in terms of produced chlorine quantity and flowrate (absorption of the full cell room production for a sufficient duration until the plant is shut down);\nsizing of the scrubbing liquid supply and storage capacity so as to ensure an excess at all times;\nsizing of the column so as to prevent flooding at all times;\npreventing the ingress of liquid chlorine into the absorption unit, for example by using knock-out pots in cases where some liquid chlorine can be present in the vent;\npreventing the backflow of scrubbing liquid into the chlorine system by using devices such as hydraulic guards and knock-out pots;\npreventing the precipitation of solids in the absorption unit by choosing an appropriate scrubbing liquid; maintaining the sodium chloride content below 22 wt% when using 18-22 wt% sodium hydroxide;\nusing heat exchangers in the circulating absorbent to limit the temperature below 55 degC at all times to prevent the excessive formation of chlorate;\nsupplying dilution air to prevent the formation of explosive gas mixtures after chlorine absorption;\nusing construction materials which withstand the extremely corrosive conditions at all times;\nusing backup equipment, such as an additional scrubber in series with the one in operation, an emergency tank with scrubbing liquid feeding the scrubber by gravity, standby and spare fans, standby and spare pumps;\nproviding an independent backup system (e.g. diesel generators or direct current batteries with an inverter) for critical electrical equipment such as the gas suction system, the scrubbing liquid circulation pumps, the key instruments for process control and the lighting;\nproviding an automatic switch to the backup system in case of emergencies, including periodic tests on this system and the switch;\nproviding process control by monitoring the following parameters in connection with an alarm system:\n\nchlorine in the outlet of the scrubber and the surrounding area;\ntemperature of the scrubbing liquids;\nreduction potential and alkalinity of the scrubbing liquids;\nsuction pressure;\nflowrate of scrubbing liquids;\npressures of pumping solutions, as well as chlorine process and relief headers;\ndifferential pressure at the inlet and outlet of packed columns;\nliquid levels in the storage and reaction tanks.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefit of this technique is a reduction of emissions of chlorine and other oxidants to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe environmental performance of a chlorine absorption unit basically depends on its layout, in the sense that the design determines the average concentration at the outlet . Current emission levels of chlorine from the absorption unit are presented in Table   3 .30. The lowest maximum concentration reported was 0.05 mg/m3, and the lowest annual average concentration 0.024 mg/m3. Taking into account data reported as ranges and annual averages, it can be estimated that chlorine emissions from the absorption units covered by the survey were in 9 % of the cases <= 0.2 mg/m3 during normal operation, in 30 % of the cases <= 0.5 mg/m3, in 55 % of the cases <= 1.0 mg/m3, in 67 % of the cases <= 2.0 mg/m3 and in 76 % of the cases <= 3.0 mg/m3 . Example data from well-performing plants are shown in Table   4 .76.\nTable 4.76:\tExample data from plants with low chlorine emissions from the chlorine absorption unit in the EU-27 in 2007 to 2011\n\n\nFor a plant with a typical gas flow of 3 000 m3/h, a reduction of the average chlorine concentration from 3 to 1 mg/m3 would result in an absolute reduction of chlorine emissions of approximately 53 kg/yr. If instead of an average chlorine concentration of 3 mg/m3, the plant usually achieved a chlorine concentration below 1 mg/m3 and only during 10-20 % of the time a concentration of 3 mg/m3 (high concentrations compared to the annual average usually occur when high hypochlorite concentrations are reached), then the absolute reduction of chlorine emissions would be approximately 5-10 kg/yr \n\nThe absorption unit at the AkzoNobel plant in Bitterfeld (Germany) is required to have the capacity to absorb the full cell room chlorine production for eight minutes, including during power failure. During this period, the plant has to be shut down. The permit furthermore requires the permanent availability of caustic soda in sufficient quantity and concentration, as well as redundant pumps for the scrubbing solution .\nCross-media effects\nConsiderable quantities of raw materials and energy are consumed for the installation and operation of the absorption unit. The main ancillary material consumed is the corrosive scrubbing liquid (i.e. the caustic soda solution).\n\nThe bleach (solution of sodium hypochlorite) produced by the chlorine absorption unit usually has too low a concentration of active chlorine to be sold, but it can be used to feed the commercial hypochlorite production unit. In this case, no further emissions occur, although the consumer might discharge free chlorine from the bleach. When there is no demand for bleach and it cannot be recycled (Section 4.3.6.3.6), it has to be destroyed before it can be discharged. The effluent from the bleach destruction may have an adverse effect on the recipient water, depending on the technique used (Section 4.3.6.3).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique. The achievement of lower residual chlorine concentrations in an existing plant generally requires the installation of an additional absorption column or ejector. Furthermore, additional pumps, pipes, tanks with scrubbing liquid, heat exchangers and instrumentation are needed and the performance of the fans needs to be increased to overcome the additional pressure drop .\n\nEconomics \nDuring the design stage of a new plant, lower chlorine emissions from the chlorine absorption unit can be achieved at a marginal cost increase, for example by increasing the height of the internal packing of the columns. However, reducing chlorine emissions in existing plants requires the installation of an additional absorption column or ejector at considerable costs .\n\nAt the Solvay plant in Santo Andre (Brazil), investment costs for a new chlorine absorption unit with two stages amounted to approximately EUR 2.0 million in 2009 .\n\nAt the AkzoNobel plant in Rotterdam-Botlek (Netherlands), the chlorine absorption unit was upgraded in 2000 to reduce emissions of chlorine from approximately 3 mg/m3 to less than 1 mg/m3. Investment costs amounted to approximately EUR 1.5 million. At that time, the plant had a chlorine capacity of 350 kt/yr, which was increased in the following years to 630 kt/yr without the need for further modification of the chlorine absorption unit, as the emissions of chlorine were still below 1 mg/m3 at its outlet .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force for implementation of this technique is environmental, as well as health and safety legislation.\n\nExample plants\nAll existing plants are equipped with chlorine absorption units. Example plants include:\n\nAkzoNobel in Rotterdam-Botlek (Netherlands), chlorine capacity 637 kt/yr;\nCABB in Gersthofen (Germany), chlorine capacity 45 kt/yr;\nChimcomplex in Borzesti (Romania), chlorine capacity 93 kt/yr;\nDow in Schkopau (Germany), chlorine capacity 250 kt/yr;\nHispavic in Martorell (Spain), chlorine capacity 218 kt/yr;\nMicroBio in Fermoy (Ireland), chlorine capacity 9 kt/yr;\nPCC Rokita in Brzeg Dolny (Poland), chlorine capacity 125 kt/yr;\nSolvay in Rheinberg (Germany), chlorine capacity 220 kt/yr;\nSolvay in Rosignano (Italy), chlorine capacity 150 kt/yr;\nSolvay in Santo Andre (Brazil), chlorine capacity 150 kt/yr;\nZachem in Bydgoszcz (Poland), chlorine capacity 72 kt/yr, plant was shut down in 2012.\nReference literature\n, , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4223390_abstract", "x": 0.67842954, "y": 0.3427588, "title": "MIST ELIMINATION AND POLLUTANT REMOVAL DEVICE AND METHOD", "year": 2023, "text": "An integrated device for removal of both liquid-containing droplets and pollutants from a gas stream includes a plurality of passageways and a plurality of exposed surface portions, different ones of the surface portions disposed along different ones of the plurality of passageways.

The first is based on the absorption of chlorine in a liquid, with subsequent wet chemical analysis, while the second is based on direct measurements in the gas phase with electrochemical cells. Other oxidising species, such as chlorine dioxide, are frequently included in the measurement results, depending on the analytical method employed .\n\nTechnical description\nThe absorption of gaseous chlorine in an aqueous solution is frequently carried out by using a solution of sulphamic acid (H3NSO3), leading to the formation of stable chloramines. The level of chloramines is subsequently determined with methods quantifying total chlorine, such as those using N,Ndiethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (DPD) (Section 4.3.3.5). Chloramines may also react with iodide in slightly acidic solution, resulting in the formation of tri-iodide, which can be measured photometrically. These two methods are applicable to chlorine concentrations of 0.30-7.0 mg/m3 (0.1-2.3 ppmv) with sampled air volumes of 15 l. Other oxidising species such as bromine and iodine are included in the measurement .\n\nAlternatively, the chloramines react with iodide to form iodine and chloride, with subsequent quantification of the latter using a chloride-selective electrode. The limit of quantification using this method is 0.14 ppmv when using sample volumes of 15 l, with an overall measurement uncertainty of +- 5 % in the range of 0.56-2 ppmv. Other oxidising species interfere with the measurement . Chlorine and chlorine dioxide can be determined simultaneously by absorption in a potassium iodide solution, with subsequent titration using thiosulphate (iodometry) . Chlorine dioxide alone can be measured by absorption in a weak basic potassium iodide solution. Under these conditions, chlorite\n(ClO2-) is formed which can be quantified by ion chromatography (chlorite oxidises iodide only in acidic solutions). The limit of quantification of this method is 1 ppbv when using 120l samples, and 18 ppbv when using 7.5-l samples, with an overall measurement uncertainty of +- 20 % in the range of 58-202 ppbv .\n\nAnother possibility for measuring chlorine is its absorption in a solution containing methylorange. The bleaching of the latter is measured with photometry. The methylorange method can be used in the concentration range of 0.06-5 mg/m3, with an overall measurement uncertainty of +- 10 % at 4.5 mg/m3 . Alternatively, absorption is carried out in a potassium bromide solution. The resulting bromine is quantified with iodometry. The bromide-iodide method can be used in a concentration range of 0.7-250 mg/m3 .\n\nAnother option to measure chlorine is to pass the sample through a filter and dilute sulphuric acid into a dilute sodium hydroxide solution. Sodium thiosulphate is subsequently added to the latter solution and the resulting chloride is measured by ion chromatography. The analytical detection limit is approximately 0.1 ppm, equivalent to 0.3 mg/m3 . This method is used in Flanders (Belgium) within a validated range of chlorine concentrations of 0.5-15 mg/m3 .\n\nField and portable instruments for the direct monitoring of chlorine in air are usually based on electrochemical cells which measure all halogens. Some instruments are equipped with a pump to bring the ambient air to the sensor, while others are directly exposed to the air (mainly for field analysers and personal monitors) without the requirement for minimal air movement speed. Electrochemical cells can measure chlorine concentrations from < 1 to 100 mg/m3. The limit of detection is usually approximately 0.3 mg/m3, with a measurement uncertainty of approximately +- 5 % and a response time of approximately 10 seconds. In case of saturation of the sensor, some time is needed to recover the full sensitivity. Other oxidising species such as bromine and chlorine dioxide may be included in the measurement . Electrochemical cells are often used as detectors, to ensure that chlorine concentrations at the point of measurement do not exceed threshold values.\n\nGas detection tubes are another possibility for measuring chlorine and chlorine dioxide. A defined quantity of gas is suctioned through a tube containing a substance on a solid carrier material. The substance reacts by changing its colour, and the concentration of chlorine is then read off the colour scale on the tube. Detection limits are typically around 0.6 mg/m3 .\n\nOther techniques such as UV-spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry and papertape-based photometers may become of interest in the future .\n\nThe calibration of the analytical techniques described above is usually based on molecular chlorine (oxidation number 0). Because of the fact that chlorine dioxide contains only one chlorine atom and its oxidation number is +IV, response factors differ. If both chlorine and chlorine dioxide are converted to chloride during the analytical measurement, then 1 mol of ClO2 gives 5 / 2 = 2.5 times as much signal as 1 mol of Cl2. In other words, 1 ppmv of ClO2 leads to a measurement result of 2.5 ppmv of Cl2. Taking into account the molecular weights, 1 mg/m3 of ClO2 therefore leads to a measurement result of (2.5  70.90 / 67.45 =) 2.6 mg/m3 of Cl2 , .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPerformance data of the different methods are included in their description in the preceding paragraphs.\n\nEconomics\nGas detection tubes are easy to operate and cheaper if monitoring is carried out occasionally .\n\nExample plants\nAll chlor-alkali plants frequently monitor chlorine concentrations, including both channelled and diffuse emissions. Instead of exact measurements, chlorine detectors with threshold alarm values are often used (indicative monitoring).\n\nReference literature\n, , , , , , , , , , \n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3339329_abstract", "x": 0.4379973, "y": 0.12780035, "title": "SELECTIVE OXIDATION OF MALTODEXTRIN AND ITS USE IN THE PREPARATION OF WATER-SOLUBLE IRON (III) CARBOXYMALTOSE COMPLEXES", "year": 2018, "text": "The present invention relates to an efficient route of synthesis of iron (III) carboxymaltose complexes, in particular ferric carboxymaltose.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.2.3.5\" title=\"Iron(III) meso-tartrate as an anti-caking agent\">\n<references_to>2.6.11.4</references_to>\n\n<content>\nIron(III) meso-tartrate as an anti-caking agent\n\nDescription\nThis technique consists in using iron(III) meso-tartrate as an anti-caking agent instead of ferrocyanide whose decomposition products may damage the membrane and increase energy consumption.\n\nTechnical description\nSodium chloride is hygroscopic above 75 % relative humidity (critical humidity). Therefore, salt crystals can absorb enough moisture during storage to form a brine film on their surfaces. Subsequent water evaporation due to changes in temperature or air humidity causes recrystallisation of the brine film and the crystals bond together. The presence of small quantities of brine included in the crystals can also contribute to caking. Evaporated salt that exits the salt dryer at higher temperatures tends to undergo increased caking during cooling in silos. Caking hampers the handling of salt, in terms of loading/unloading and transport. To prevent caking, an aqueous ferrocyanide solution is frequently sprayed onto the salt. A final concentration of 2-20 ppmw of sodium ferrocyanide decahydrate (Na4[Fe(CN)6]*10 H2O) is generally sufficient to prevent caking . Ferrocyanide prevents caking by altering the crystallisation behaviour of sodium chloride .\n\nThe drawback of using ferrocyanide is that the complex is very stable, so the iron is not oxidised and precipitated as hydroxide during the primary brine purification. Ferrocyanide is therefore transferred to the electrolysis cell where it reacts with chlorine to form Fe(III) and cyanide. The latter is oxidised to cyanate, which may be further oxidised to ammonia . Ammonia is an unwanted impurity in the brine, as it may lead to the formation of explosive nitrogen trichloride (Section 2.6.11.4). Iron is also unwanted in the membrane cell technique, as it deposits on the electrodes or on/in the membranes, leading to shorter lifetimes of electrodes and membranes, to reduced product qualities and to higher energy consumption (Table   2 .4).\n\nFerrocyanide can be decomposed without the formation of nitrogen trichloride by adding chlorine to resaturated brine at temperatures higher than 80 degC and pH > 7, followed by primary purification to remove the liberated iron. However, this technique is rarely used due to the additional investment and operating costs , .\n\nIron(III) meso-tartrate was introduced in 2004 as an alternative anti-caking agent. This complex is thermodynamically less stable so that iron is precipitated as hydroxide during primary brine purification. The residual tartrate is transferred to the electrolysis cells and fully oxidised to hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide. No unwanted substances are formed .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of this technique include:\n\nreduction of energy consumption;\nreduced formation of explosive nitrogen trichloride, which reduces the risk of accidental emissions if chlorine is liquefied.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTest runs with ferrocyanide-containing brine at the AkzoNobel plant in Rotterdam (Netherlands) revealed a cell voltage increase of approximately 50 mV during the first month. No such increase was found with brine containing iron(III) meso-tartrate .\n\nCross-media effects\nSome raw materials and energy are consumed for the production of iron(III) meso-tartrate. This anti-caking agent is biodegradable and decomposes quickly in soil or water . No halogenated organic compounds are formed in the brine circuit .\n\nA drawback of the use of iron(III) meso-tartrate is that the iron content of the salt is increased by approximately 15 % compared to ferrocyanide, resulting in more solid waste from brine purification .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nThe flow properties of iron(III) meso-tartrate deteriorate over time, therefore requiring careful stock control of the salt .\n\nEconomics\nSlightly higher amounts of iron(III) meso-tartrate are required compared to ferrocyanide. Cost savings due to a reduction of power consumption can be up to 5 % in the case of plants with brine acidification. Cost savings are negligible if the feed brine to the cells is alkaline . Further savings result from the longer lifetimes of electrodes and membranes and the reduced downtime due to maintenance, as well as increased product quality .\nSimilar cost savings due to reduced energy consumption can also be achieved by a ferrocyanide decomposition unit . However, this technique is rarely used due to the additional investment and operating costs .\n\nIn 2011, iron(III) meso-tartrate was only available in conjunction with the purchase of vacuum salt from a particular supplier.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation of this technique include :\n\nreduction of costs related to energy consumption;\nreduction of costs related to equipment and maintenance;\nincreased process safety.\n\nExample plants\nIn 2011, AkzoNobel reported having used approximately 1 Mt/yr of vacuum salt with iron(III) meso-tartrate since 2005 in its own chlor-alkali plants . In 2010, a contract was signed between AkzoNobel and another European chlorine producer for 0.5 Mt/yr of vacuum salt with iron(III) meso-tartrate .\n\nReference literature\n, , , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3835772_abstract", "x": 0.7146528, "y": 0.36875027, "title": "GAS DETECTOR", "year": 2021, "text": "A gas detection unit is accommodated within a housing of a gas sensor and the outside atmosphere of the housing is introduced through the filter to the gas detection unit.

Selection of the appropriate technique depends on the composition, flow and conditions of the off-gas stream. The design of the abatement process is critical. Factors such as efficiency, suitability of the method and the input and output loading of the material to be collected are used. A full discussion of the working principles is given in the BREF document for non-ferrous metal industries. The following techniques are used in the foundry industry.\nDust and particle removal:\ncyclones\nfabric or bag filters\nwet scrubbers\nGas scrubbing systems (SO2, Cl, amine removal):\nwet scrubbing using scrubber towers, venturi scrubbers and disintegrators.\nOil-mist separators:\nwet electrostatic precipitators\nCO and organics removal:\npost combustion\nbiofilter.\nFor dust and particle removal, both wet and dry systems are used. The main advantage with using dry systems is that the dust is captured dry, which allows its subsequent re-use. Furthermore, no pollution is transferred to another medium, as is the case for wet systems. For gaseous compounds, such as SO2 and chlorides, bag filters are inefficient, since they are not adsorbed onto the filter surface. Experiments with lime injection have not provided good results. The following describes the system used for dust and particle removal:\n\nCyclones: If the right measures are taken (i.e. heat resistant steel, refractory lining) a cyclone filter may be used for dedusting hot flue-gases (500 - 600 oC). The efficiency is too low to achieve emission levels in the 20 mg/Nm3 range. The cyclone is mainly used as a spark separator in front of a bag filter. Cyclones are used as a pretreatment step to other abatement systems\nMulticyclones: The separation efficiency of a cyclone increases with decreasing diameter. The use of a parallel series of small cyclones allows the separation of small dust particles, without a sharp increase in the pressure drop over the cleaning equipment\nBag filter: This type of separator is widely applied in various parts of the foundry process, due to its good efficiency and low emission values. It can achieve good efficiencies in controlling the fine particulate matter found in melting operations. Sub-micron particles such as metallic oxides may be separated as well. For proper operation, the following measures need to be taken: flue-gas cooling (T = 130  160 oC) and separation of sparks (using a cyclone). The post combustion of organic material (to reduce the fire risk) may be applied for an off-gas with a high VOC content. Post combustion as a \"firewall\" for bag filter protection has been reported in some cases for off-gas from the unpacking of drums. This technique is not applied in general; instead waste gas streams with high dust loads are mixed with gas streams with increased VOC contents to prevent the filter and the exhaust ducts from becoming sticky. A view of the inside and outside of a bag filter unit is given in Figure   4 .77.\n\nFigure 4.77: Bag filter units; inside (l.) and outside (m., r.) views\n[237, HUT, 2003]\n\n\nHigh temperature filter systems (using a ceramic filter medium): These are available on the market but not currently applied in the foundry industry \n\nElectrostatic precipitators (ESP): These are not widely applied for foundry flue-gas dedusting. Due to their sensitivity to gas flow, gas temperature and humidity, they are only suitable for continuous melting regimes. They also incur a considerable explosion risk, due to the high gas volume they contain. The removal of dust to reduce this risk requires frequent cleaning, and therefore might incur economic problems. The main field of application for electrostatic precipitators in foundries is oil/mist removal from pressure die-casting exhaust gases. \n\nWet dedusting systems, such as venturi and disintegrators, are applied in melting flue-gas treatment. Scrubber towers are used for dedusting of non-melting off-gas. Compared to dry systems the wet systems have the following disadvantages: higher energy consumption, higher maintenance (corrosion, bacteria), and they result in waste water and a sludge for disposal. Advantages are the capture of water-soluble compounds (such as SO2, chlorides), quick cooling - which prevents dioxin reformation, low investment costs, and less restriction on input temperature. \n\nVenturi scrubbers: Water is sprayed into the gases as they pass through a venturi. The acceleration of the gas flow in the venturi throat causes an intensive mixing of both media. The dust particles are damped, making them heavier, so that they can be separated in a cyclone or other system placed downstream. If the gas flow drops, the venturi throat is adjusted to maintain the collection efficiency\nDisintegrators: These so-called dynamic scrubbers consist of concentric rotor and stator mounted pins through which the gas stream is driven by means of a fan placed downstream or by fan blades at the outer end of the rotor. Water injected into the centre of the rotor, is broken into fine droplets by the pins and dispersed in the gas stream. The wet particles impinge on the stator walls and are collected at the bottom of the disintegrator. The system works efficiently when the gas flow is reduced.\n\nPost combustion systems and biofilters will be discussed in Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.9, respectively.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions to the atmosphere.\n\nCross-media effects\nWet scrubber systems result in the production of a waste water flow, which then needs treatment. The cleaned water may be recirculated into the process. Sludge cakes, produced from the waste water treatment need to be disposed of.\n\nIf the foundry is located in a cold climate (heating season more than 6 months), all increases in air ventilation will also cause a growth in the energy consumption, since the workplace has to be heated more. \n\nThe use of all abatement systems require the use of energy to induce the draught of the gases through the abatement system. \n\nOperational data\nA comparison of the properties of wet and dry systems is given in Table   4 .106. In the subsequent sections, techniques that are specific for the various melting furnaces and for the various process stages will be discussed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.106: Properties of wet and dry abatement systems for foundries\n[110, Vito, 2001], [155, European IPPC Bureau, 2001], [202, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2002]\n\n\nFigure   4 .78 gives a comparison of the operational conditions for hot blast cupola furnaces with a wet and dry dedusting system.

Generally, bag filters are installed for this purpose, but it is also technically possible to use wet dedusting techniques.\nIn order to lower the temperature of the exhaust gases, they are diluted with ambient air. This is achieved by the intake of air through a gap between the furnace exhaust and the elbow shaped exhaust pipe. This gap is always present as it allows the furnace body to be able to rotate and tilt. Often the exhaust pipe is retractable. In general, dilution for emission reduction is unacceptable. If dilution is used (and is necessary) for cooling, the end-of-pipe technology should have the right dimension for the larger gas flow. Sometimes the diluted waste gases are then fed through an air-gas heat-exchanger for further cooling. This way the gas temperature is reduced from the initial 1500 oC to 200 oC, or lower. At this temperature, the gases can be introduced into a bag filter for dedusting.\n\nThe application of an afterburner allows the reduction of organic carbon emissions and combustible particles. This technique may also be effective in reducing the risk of dioxin formation upon cooling of the gases. The afterburner is installed after the furnace and before the heat-exchanger. One of the following afterburner types may be used:\nthermal incinerator: combustion in an open flame\ncatalytic incinerator: combustion at lower temperatures through the use of a catalyst, resulting in a higher efficiency and lower NOx emissions\nrecuperative incinerator: combustion with a heat recovery for preheating the combustion air, resulting in a higher thermal efficiency and lower fuel consumption\ncatalytic recuperative incinerator: a combination of the previous two types.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of particulate emissions from rotary furnaces. \n\nCross-media effects\nExhaust gas cleaning increases the energy consumption. The dedusting of the exhaust gas generates a dust for disposal or re-use.\n\nOperational data\nOperational emission data are given in Section 3.2.5.3. \n\nAn afterburner can be expected to achieve between 80 % and 98 % efficiency for burning the combustible particulates emitted from the rotary furnace. Hot gases from the afterburner can be ducted through a recuperator and can assist in preheating the combustion air to the main furnace burner. Recuperators offer an energy saving of up to 15 %. \n\nApplicability\nThis technique is applicable to all new and existing rotary furnace installations, both in ferrous and non-ferrous foundries. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nRegulations limiting the dust emissions from the melting of metals. \n\nExample plants\nThis technique is commonly applied in foundries using a rotary furnace.\n\nReference literature \n[23, Brettschneider and Vennebusch, 1992], [32, CAEF, 1997], [163, UK Environment Agency, 2002], [202, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2002]\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3923110_abstract", "x": 0.7459801, "y": 0.2863714, "title": "TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR GAS-FIRED RADIANT TUBE AND CONTROL METHOD THEREFOR", "year": 2021, "text": "The invention discloses a temperature control system with a fuel gas radiant tube, comprising at least one fuel gas radiant tube extending into a heat treatment furnace for heat radiating, and further comprising: a first thermocouple arranged inside the fuel gas radiant tube for temperature control of a heating are, a second thermocouple embedded in the wall of the fuel gas radiant tube for temperature control during a heat preserving period and over-temperature alarm during A heating-up period; and a third thermocouple arranged in a working area of the heat treatment furnace for temperature control during the heating-up period.

These cause releases of noxious and odorous VOCs during core production and storage. Furthermore VOC emissions (benzene, toluene, xylene) occur during pouring, cooling and shake-out. Alternative solvents for cold-box core production are based on protein or animal fat (e.g. vegetable-oil methyl esters) or on silicate esters. These solvents are not noxious to workers health, nor inflammable and therefore transport and storage are easier. \n\nThe low volatility of the vegetable-oil methyl esters enhances the storage capabilities in humid atmospheres and their persistence when applying water-based coatings. \n\nThe resulting cores have a higher strength, lower sticking of the sand and good shake-out properties. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThere is no vaporisation due to the high boiling point (about 300 oC) and thus there is no solvent odour emission during storage. \n\nVOC emissions are reduced during core manufacturing and storage, and (more importantly) during pouring, cooling and shake-out. \n\nCross-media effects\nVegetable-based solvents cause increased fume production during pouring and (in the case of die-casting) upon opening of the die. This is due to the low evaporation and consequently high residual solvent content upon pouring. This effect does not occur with silicate ester solvents.\n\nProtein and animal fat based solvents produce a distinctive odour, and have been reported to cause odour problems inside the foundry. \n\nOperational data\nTable   4 .98 shows operational emission values for benzene, toluene, xylene and phenol, as measured in one aluminium green sand foundry. Measurements were performed both at the shake-out grate and in the exhaust-air stack. Data are given for the traditional cold-box system and for one using vegetable-oil based solvents. A clear reduction in BTX and C-emissions is observed (25 - 50 % of stack emissions). \n\n\n\nTable 4.98: Emission data for cold-box core systems in an aluminium foundry, measured at the shake-out grate and in the exhaust-air stack\n[189, Huttenes-Albertus, 2002]\n\n\nResults of emission measurements in a German iron foundry are given in Table   4 .99. For this table, the measured emission of each compound is expressed relative to the emission of the same compound for the aromatic-based system. For example: the emission of toluene at the second cooling is only 58 % of the toluene emission for the aromatic system. The table shows a clear reduction of VOC emissions in the second cooling and shake-out phase. \n\nTable 4.99: Emissions (%) of selected compounds from vegetable-based cold-box core systems\n[216, Hobelsberger, et al., 1997]\n\n\nThe total mass flow reduction of the specified compounds was: \nbenzene: \t- 21 %\ntoluene: \t- 26 %\nxylene: \t- 30 %\nphenol: \t- 62 %\n\nA survey measurement of the total carbon emission over the full foundry process is given in Figure   4 .76. The data show that the vegetable-based solvents partially result in a shift of emissions from the core-making area to the finishing area. Nevertheless an overall reduction of 17 % carbon emission reduction is reached.\n\n\nFigure 4.76: Total carbon emissions from various process steps, using aromatic- and vegetable-based solvents\n(values in % expressed relative to emission of the aromatic based system)\n[216, Hobelsberger, et al., 1997]\n\n\nApplicability\nNon-aromatic solvents can be applied in all processes using cold-box sand. The technique is relatively new and operational results as stated above need to be confirmed through repeated application. The technique has been implemented in foundries for the full range of automotive castings, as well as in castings for machinery, and in the construction and electronics industry. Both ferrous and non-ferrous applications are reported. \n\nEconomics\nData from the Italian foundry association indicate that non-aromatic solvents have a cost that is double that of the aromatic equivalent, e.g. EUR 0.82/kg against EUR 0.36 - 0.48/kg. \n\nOperational data from a large series ferrous foundry showed that binder prices for aromatic cold box were around EUR 2/kg (2001) and went up with some 30 %, upon changing to the non-aromatic system.

The high temperature results in a condensation and deposition of a release agent film. This technique is an alternative to the spraying of a water-based solution of the release agent onto the open die. It allows the water usage to be reduced and also reduces the consumption of release agents. The active substances for the process, i.e. getting the casting out of the die, are very similar to the open-mould technique: paraffin wax, aliphatic carbons, polysiloxanes, polyglycol. \n\nWater spraying, however, also causes the necessary cooling of the die surface. The alternative technique therefore requires enhanced temperature management (mainly by a cooling effect), by means of an internal die cooling system. This may be obtained by reducing the thermal oil temperature. Combined water spraying and closed-mould release agent application is possible in places where the moulds cannot achieve complete thermal equilibrium by means of internal cooling systems alone. \n\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe technique allows a reduction in the usage of both water and the release agent. This results in a lower amount of waste water and reduced emissions of steam containing oily particles. The active compounds of the release agent are comparable to the traditional ones. Emissions due to decomposition of the release agent (and upon opening the die to get the casting out) therefore are comparable in nature to those with the open-mould technique. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique requires an increased effort to cool the dies. In simple cases, this may involve a lowering of the thermal oil temperature, but for more complex dies, it may involve the application of an additional cooling circuit. \n\nOperational data\nSome operational examples in aluminium foundries have been reported. These result in a 50 - 80 % reduction in the spraying time, and a 80 % reduction in sleeve-parting agent consumption. \n\nApplicability\nThe technique is applicable in existing installations, but may require the production of specific dies with integrated or adapted cooling circuit.

Fabric filters are widely used to dedust the exhaust gases. Venturi scrubbers or disintegrators are applied less due to their higher energy consumption, the necessity for water treatment prior to discharge, and due to the need to dispose or recycle wet filter sludge. Fabric filters are widely used in favour of electrostatic filters, due to the wide fluctuations in gas temperature and the particulate concentration of the exhaust gases. \n\nIf a fabric filter is used, several precautions need to be taken in order to protect the filter medium as discussed in Section 4.5.1.3. These include:\nusing a high temperature cyclone or multicyclone\nusing gas cooling equipment. Here the exhaust gases are cooled by dilution with ambient air, water injection (quenching), heat-exchangers or by the use of long ducts. Water injection, in particular, has an additional advantage, in that the quick cooling down of the exhaust gases prevents the recombination of any partially burned organic substances, thereby leading to a cleaner emission. The cooling system needs an effective control system to prevent gases which are too hot from entering the fabric filters.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of particulate emissions from Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF). \n\nCross-media effects\nThe application of wet dedusting techniques causes a higher energy consumption, the necessity for water treatment prior to discharge, and the need to dispose or recycle wet filter sludge.\n\nOperational data\nOperational data are given in Section 3.2.3.4.

High air velocities carry the granulated bed material and the feedstock up through the combustion zone to the top of the combustion chamber, i.e. the freeboard.  The material then passes through a hot cyclonic collector.  Hot gases pass through the cyclone and the majority of solids drop to the bottom of the cyclone and are reinjected into the bed of the furnace.  Uncirculated flue gases pass to heat recovery and flue gas treatment processes.\n\nThe feedstock is introduced between the cyclone and the reactor bed, via a screw conveyor, from a holding silo.  No atomisers or special nozzles are required to introduce the waste.  A combustion air fan provides air to the bed for fluidisation and combustion.  The furnace draft is maintained by an induced draft fan downstream of the cyclone.\n\nThe retention time of the material in the furnace is controlled by controlling the discharge from the ash cooler.  Not all of the cyclone bottom ash is recirculated.  Some is removed via an ash conveyor.  The speed of this conveyor determines the rate of removal of material, so decreasing the speed increases the retention time.  This feature can, in appropriate circumstances, allow lower combustion temperatures, with consequent lower supplementary fuel requirements and less refractory damage and maintenance.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nFor animal meal, it has been claimed that TSE-risk materials can be destroyed, by destroying proteins.  The heat generated can be used to produce electricity, hot water or steam, which can be used either in on-site associated activities, or off-site.\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions of SO2, HCI, NOx and CO to air and additional energy use due to the requirement for the destruction of protein to destroy BSE prions and to fluidise the bed.\n\nOperational data\nAt an example plant, a trial was undertaken using 100 % animal meal, with a calorific value in the range 17 - 21 MJ/kg, a thermal load of approximately 9 - 12 MW and a throughput performance of 1550 to 2550 kg/h.  It is reported that if in the same fluidisation bed, the throughput was changed to 2500 - 7500 kg/h, then a thermal output of 4.8 - 9.7 MW would be achieved.\n\nThe incineration in the circulating fluidised bed was carried out at a minimum temperature of 850 oC.  The gas residence time was controlled to approximately 4 s, by setting the ash removal rate.  The measuring system for testing the prescribed minimum dwell time of 2 s and the temperature requirements was located between the two return cyclone separators specifically, between the top of the furnace head and the inlet to the boiler.\n\nThe hot flue gases were directed from the cyclone, where they were separated from the heavier solid matter.  SNCR was used for NOx removal, by injecting urea into the flue gas stream between the return cyclone and the waste heat boiler, at a temperature of > 850 oC.  The boiler was used for heat recovery.  Further cooling plus inorganic chlorine and sulphur dioxide removal was achieved using a scrubber containing calcium hydroxide in suspension.

High air velocities carry the granulated bed material and the feedstock up through the combustion zone to the top of the combustion chamber, i.e. the freeboard.  The material then passes through a hot cyclonic collector.  Hot gases pass through the cyclone and the majority of solids drop to the bottom of the cyclone and are reinjected into the bed of the furnace.  Uncirculated flue gases pass to heat recovery and flue gas treatment processes.\n\nThe feedstock is introduced between the cyclone and the reactor bed, via a screw conveyor, from a holding silo.  No atomisers or special nozzles are required to introduce the waste.  A combustion air fan provides air to the bed for fluidisation and combustion.  The furnace draft is maintained by an induced draft fan downstream of the cyclone.\n\nThe retention time of the material in the furnace is controlled by controlling the discharge from the ash cooler.  Not all of the cyclone bottom ash is recirculated.  Some is removed via an ash conveyor.  The speed of this conveyor determines the rate of removal of material, so decreasing the speed increases the retention time.  This feature can, in appropriate circumstances, allow lower combustion temperatures, with consequent lower supplementary fuel requirements and less refractory damage and maintenance.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nFor animal meal, it has been claimed that TSE-risk materials can be destroyed, by destroying proteins.  The heat generated can be used to produce electricity, hot water or steam, which can be used either in on-site associated activities, or off-site.\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions of SO2, HCI, NOx and CO to air and additional energy use due to the requirement for the destruction of protein to destroy BSE prions and to fluidise the bed.\n\nOperational data\nAt an example plant, a trial was undertaken using 100 % animal meal, with a calorific value in the range 17 - 21 MJ/kg, a thermal load of approximately 9 - 12 MW and a throughput performance of 1550 to 2550 kg/h.  It is reported that if in the same fluidisation bed, the throughput was changed to 2500 - 7500 kg/h, then a thermal output of 4.8 - 9.7 MW would be achieved.\n\nThe incineration in the circulating fluidised bed was carried out at a minimum temperature of 850 oC.  The gas residence time was controlled to approximately 4 s, by setting the ash removal rate.  The measuring system for testing the prescribed minimum dwell time of 2 s and the temperature requirements was located between the two return cyclone separators specifically, between the top of the furnace head and the inlet to the boiler.\n\nThe hot flue gases were directed from the cyclone, where they were separated from the heavier solid matter.  SNCR was used for NOx removal, by injecting urea into the flue gas stream between the return cyclone and the waste heat boiler, at a temperature of > 850 oC.  The boiler was used for heat recovery.  Further cooling plus inorganic chlorine and sulphur dioxide removal was achieved using a scrubber containing calcium hydroxide in suspension.  Carbon was injected to remove dioxins, furans and heavy metals.  A fibrous filter was used for dust removal.  Prions were not detected in the ash and it was therefore deduced that the proteins had been destroyed.\n\nThe achieved emission levels from this trial with 100 % animal meal incineration are illustrated in Table   4 .120.\n\nTable 4.120: Emissions incinerating 100 % animal meal in a circulating fluidised bed\n\n\nExample plants\nA trial dedicated to the incineration of 100 % animal meal was carried out at one circulating fluidised bed incinerator in Germany.\n\nReference literature\n[244, Germany, 2002, 334, Brunner C.

In rendering, raw materials typically contain about 60 % water.  Multiple-effect evaporators operate at relatively low temperatures and this prevents scorching of the animal by-products being treated.  Removing water by evaporation is an energy-intensive process, and low-pressure evaporators are more efficient at this than open kettles or other systems operating at atmospheric pressure.  At 50.7 kPa (0.5 atmospheres), water boils at 81.5 oC.  Evaporators can be made to operate at much lower pressures than 50.7 kPa, therefore, vapour just above 100 oC can be used as the heat source for the evaporators.\n\nAn effective use of the evaporative heat can be achieved in a multiple-effect evaporator.  After the separation of the raw materials into a solid and a liquid phase in a continuous system, by either pressing, centrifugation, or a combination of both, the liquid phase can be dried in a multiple-effect evaporator.  The heating-medium is the steam raised from the drying of the solid phase and from the evaporation in the other stages of the vacuum drier.  The Atlas process of mechanical dewatering is an example of such a process.  The heat consumption in this process is 400 - 450 kWh/t of raw materials.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced energy use for evaporation, i.e. by re-use of the heat from the evaporated water.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone.\n\nOperational data\nA multiple-effect evaporator is shown in Figure   4 .42.  In theory, the efficiency of evaporation can be almost doubled by each doubling of effects, i.e. twice as much liquid can be evaporated per quantity of live steam or vapour consumed in the steam jacket.  In a multiple-effect evaporator system, vapour from an effect is condensed in the steam jacket of a succeeding effect.  This is possible because the succeeding effect will be operated at a lower pressure and thus a lower temperature.\n\n\nFigure 4.42: Multiple-effect evaporator\n\n\nThe efficiency of evaporators can be improved by providing more heat transfer surface than that given by simply jacketing the boiling chamber.  The evaporators often consist of vertical tube bundles with the heating medium on the outside of the tubes and the product boiling on the inside.  Product is either moved up through the tubes, i.e. in what is described as a \"rising film\", or down-ward through the tubes, in which case the evaporator is called a \"falling film\" evaporator.  The product is fed into these evaporators in such a way and at such a flowrate that facilitates the formation of a thin film covering the inside of the tubes.  This results in high heat transfer coefficients and a tremendous amount of water can be boiled off within a relatively small area of equipment.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in fat melting, rendering, fish-meal production and gelatine manufacture treating more than 50000 - 100000 tonnes per year.\n\nEconomics\nThe capital cost of such continuous installations is reportedly higher than that of conventional systems and they are reported to be only suited for plants with a relatively high level of raw material supplies, i.e. more than 50000 - 100000 t/yr.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduced energy consumption and consequently reduced costs.\nExample plants\nAll rendering plants in Denmark.\n\nReference literature\n[249, GME, 2002, 268, Ockerman H.

When a combustion temperature is reached and maintained with a steady supply of feedstock, the emissions to air are more uniform.  Consequently, the emissions per tonne of feedstock are lower.  Abatement equipment can be designed and run to lower emissions, with a consequent lower energy use and chemical consumption.  Less supplementary fuel is required for continuous incineration than for batch incineration, since the feedstock continues to act as a fuel to maintain the combustion temperature.  For batch incineration, as the feedstock is consumed additional fuel is required to complete the combustion process.\n\nContinuous incineration may provide a faster disposal route for animal by-products and may reduce odour problems associated with the storage and handling of putrescent materials.  Incineration before malodorous substances are formed may be achievable, e.g. at incinerators located on the same site as slaughterhouses.\n\nA method of treating malodorous air, i.e. the incinerator, is always available, except when the incinerator is stopped for, e.g. maintenance.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone reported, compared with batch processes.\n\nOperational data\nMaintenance problems associated with damage to the equipment, e.g. the refractory lining of the incineration chamber, caused by frequent heating and cooling during batch incineration are avoided.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable when sizing new incinerators to process anticipated feedstock throughputs.
