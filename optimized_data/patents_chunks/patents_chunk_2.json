However, the properties of the product and the concentration of the polymer in the reactor are interdependent.

The recycling energy is reduced by improving heat removal by the addition of a condensable solvent and/or comonomer in the reactor system (so called 'condensation mode')\nHDPE slurry suspension process - the maximum viscosity of the slurry limits the maximum concentration of polymer solids in the hydrocarbon diluent.

The feed temperature of the water to the vapour condenser should not be lower than 50 degC to avoid condensation of CS2 inside the vapour condenser.\n\nCS2 and steam-saturated air pass through the condenser where the gases are extracted by a water jet, in which more CS2 is condensed by the cold water.\n\nThe gaseous phase is then separated from the liquid phase by means of an air separator. \n\nThe gaseous phase contains air and all the non-condensed gases, whereas the liquid phase consists of process water and condensed CS2, which are then separated in the CS2-settler. \nThe gaseous phase is vented to further purification, such as described in Section 12.7.3.

Tilgner and S. Tyszkiewicz together with their students and co-authors. In 1962, Prof. D.J.Tilgner's doctoral student Kazimierz Miler defended his doctoral thesis at the Gdansk University of Technology on the subject of \"Possibilities of producing smoke free of 3,4 benzopyrene and 1,2,3,4 disubenzanthracene\", and Dr. S. Tyszkiewicz published the results of his research on the osmotic nature of the transport of chemicals dissolved or colloidally dispersed in the water of post-mortem muscle juice in the book \"Study of the physical properties of meat\" published in WNT in Warsaw in 1969. Docent Dr. K. Miler, working at the Institutes of the Meat Industry (IPM) and the Meat and Fat Industry (IPMiT), together with numerous co-authors, patented 6 methods of producing smoke preparations (SP) and partially implemented them in Poland and other countries, and after his death in 1994, his student Dr. and later associate professor and professor Adam Borys patented two more SP in 2001 and 2013, but without any chance of their personal implementation. In the 1980s, due to real or fictionalised information about the intention to evict from the cities meat factories emitting smoke from wood-fired smokehouses into the atmosphere and churning wood sawdust, research on smoking with closed smoke circulation in smoke chambers without chimneys was launched at IPMiT. A team of researchers led by Prof. S. Tyszkiewicz patented the method and equipment for smoking with closed smoke circulation and successfully put it into practice. However, larger urban meat factories equipped with mass-produced smokehouses installed smoke afterburners in their chimneys and converted smoke emissions into carbon dioxide emissions, and IPMiT stopped paying to protect the patents it held for closed-smoke smoking. Smaller area plants did not have to change anything, as smoke emissions were not banned and no standardisation of the presence of harmful smoke components was introduced. The situation changed dramatically after the introduction of a standard for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the European Union, and standards also had to be implemented by EU candidate countries. A standard for carcinogenic PAHs in food was introduced in the European Union in 2006, limiting benzo(a)pyrene and the sum of four (PAHs)4 : benzo(a)pyrene BAP, benzo(a)anthracene BAA, benzo(b)fluoranthene BBF and chrysene CH. In 2011, the requirements were tightened with effect from 2014. The contamination limits are set in \u00b5g/kg, which means extremely trace concentrations that are unrealistic under the usual environmental conditions of the earth's atmosphere. This means that the limits set should be regarded as conventional, and dimensionless similarity numbers (BLPs), for example the ratio of the concentration of a single PAH to the sum of four PAHs determined in the same sample by the same method, should be taken seriously. The PAHs in the trace concentrations of the colloid dispersive substance, determined in \u00b5g/kg, when examined by chromatography over a longer period of time after smoking, do not represent the actual degree of contamination, because when the samples are ground and weighed, substances from not only the surface, but also from substances contained in the inner layers, evaporate from them. The smoking method according to the invention removes the two most toxic smoke components from the smokehouse and converts them into carbon dioxide saturating into condensed and separately disposed water. Characterised by a much higher volatility, dibenzo(ah)anthracene (DAHA) is particularly highly toxic, having formerly been considered five times more harmful than BAP. Present in products immediately after the smoking process and evaporating into the atmosphere, it should be determined especially in products that are eaten quickly after smoking or grilling on charcoal grills without a post-smoking process (favourable open hearth with access to air, flambrying). The method of air smoking according to the invention ensures the removal of contamination from the smoke and prevents the contamination from escaping outside the smoking chamber and the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"12.1.3\" title=\"Fugitive loss assessment and measurement\">\n<referenced_by>13.1</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nFugitive loss assessment and measurement\n\nDescription\n\nA good fugitive loss measurement and repair programme requires an accurate calculation of components and the establishment of a database. In the database, components are classified in terms of type, service and process conditions to identify those elements with the highest potential for fugitive losses and to facilitate the application of industry standard leak factors.

In pulp and paper mill effluents, the amount of nutrients is normally low compared with the amount of organic substances. It is therefore often necessary to add phosphorus and nitrogen to the waste water to achieve efficient treatment. However, it is recommendable to assess whether the initial nutrient supply in the waste water is sufficient. In some cases, e.g. if eucalyptus is used as a raw material, enough phosphorus is present in the waste water and no or only little additional nitrogen is needed. In controlling the functionality of the biological waste water treatment the following aspects are of importance.\n\nTechnique I. Sufficient nutrient supply of the microorganisms\nMicroorganisms in biological waste water treatment plants need a sufficient N and P supply to break down the dissolved organic substances in the waste water. Effluents from pulp and paper mills mostly contain only low concentrations of N and P so, for the effective operation of the biological waste water treatment plant, nutrients e.g. in the form of urea and phosphoric acid are added. An exception are mills pulping wood from Iberian eucalyptus, from which higher amounts of phosphorus are released during pulping. No phosphorus is added to the biological treatment plants treating effluents from eucalyptus pulp mills.\n\nThe addition of nutrients is carried out with readily available nutrient compounds, preferably ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-). In some cases, higher concentrations of nutrients are carried with the process water (sometimes with varying concentration and composition). In these cases and also when water flows vary, excess nutrients are measured after the biological treatment plant if the dosage is not adjusted accordingly. The operator of the biological treatment plant has to find the right balance between insufficient supply of N and P to the biological system and undesired overdose. Insufficient nutrient supply may damage the biocoenosis (see paragraph on 'bulking sludge' below) and may subsequently reduce the removal rate of the plant. An overdose is undesired because released excess nutrients increase eutrophication in water bodies.\n\nMany mills do not consider the content of N and P in the inflowing process water or the variation of hydraulic loading and time-proportionally add the same amount of nutrients to the waste water continuously. However, in some cases organic nitrogen compounds are introduced into the waste water by the used chemical additives that are hydrolysed in the biological system and converted into ammonium. This can result in a situation where the concentration of biologically useable nitrogen exceeds the need of the biological system. The need for nutrients varies between mills. As a maximum theoretical demand, a ratio of BOD:N:P of 100:5:1 is required . In practice, ratios of 100:2.3 - 2.5:0.5 are also successfully applied in a number of treatment plants.\n\nTechnique II. Nutrient dosage\nThe nutrient requirements of the different aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems vary within certain limits. The appropriate nutrient supply can be controlled from three different sides.\n\n(a) From the inlet into the biological waste water treatment plant. It should initially be based on a ratio of BOD:N:P in the influent to the aerobic biological stage of about 100:3.0:0.5 and then be optimised according to the real needs. Since it has proved very difficult to reliably determine the BOD of waste water in due time (analysis is too slow) some mills use (on-line) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as a parameter, applying an initial ratio of reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P of 100:1:0.2. Others continuously measure the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) for the regulation of the nutrient dosage. \n(b) From the treated effluents. For sufficient nutrient supply the yearly average values \nafter the biological treatment should be: 0.5 - 1 mg/l NH4-N and 0.5 - 1 mg/l PO4-P \n or referring to all measured values, e.g. over a complete year, single measurement values between 0 and 2 mg/l.\n\nTreatment plants with very stable operational conditions and few load fluctuations may need lower average concentrations as indicated under point (b), especially with regard to P. The given target values are derived from experience and are intended to give only a rough orientation. Every biological system needs to be optimised and fine-tuned case by case.\n\n(c) By analysing the biomass itself. The control of the effluent concentration in activated sludge systems often does not provide clear evidence for an optimised nutrient supply of the biomass. The composition of the biomass should be monitored by an analysis of the ash content, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total P of the activated sludge samplings, especially if the sludge characteristics are unfavourable, or the degradation capacity of the treatment plant does not meet expectations. The target values for the analysed activated sludge sampling are (based on dry solids):\n\nP: >10 mg Total P/g Dry Solids (DS))\nN: 50 - 60 mg TKN/g Dry Solids (DS)).\n\nThe P supply in particular has a very strong influence on the sludge properties (sludge volume index). The sludge volume index should be determined daily or weekly. It is one of the most important parameters for controlling an activated sludge process. The microorganisms ought to be checked by microscopy weekly.\n\nFor combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plants, it should be noted that the anaerobic bacteria have lower nutrient requirements than the aerobic. The optimal ratio of N and P for the organic load must be determined in each case. Experience has shown that a ratio of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P:S of 350:5:1:1 gives good results . It was found that reducing the dosage of nutrients to the lower needs of anaerobic biomass results in operating conditions that are too unstable for the following aerobic stage. It is therefore necessary to dose in the inlet of the anaerobic stage the N and P necessary for the subsequent aerobic treatment. \n\nTechnique III. Control of the nutrient dosing\nFor an optimised dosing of nutrients, the most appropriate control parameter has to be chosen for every plant. When measuring N and P concentrations in the inlet, especially for nitrogen the bioavailability of the nitrogen species should be taken into account. The measurement of NH4-N is not always sufficient, e.g. when significant quantities of organic compounds (measured as Kjeldahl nitrogen) that are present in the waste water are transformed into bioavailable ammonium compounds. In turn, not all organic N compounds (TKN) are useable by the microorganisms and will partially pass unchanged the biological treatment. Excess ammonia and dissolved total P or PO43--P in the effluent after the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), together with N % and P % of sludge and its settleability, are the key parameters to be monitored for nutrient dosing. On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement may complete the control.\n\nA suitable control of the nutrients dosing is essential for economic and environmental reasons. The control of the N- and P-dosing as a function of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) load is a suitable approach for the control of the nutrient dosing. For the dosing, empirically determined ratios of Total Organic Carbon (TOC):N:P can be used taking into account the continuously measured concentrations of N and P in the untreated waste water. On-line Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements and on-line measurement of N and P especially for larger plants are appropriate tools for nutrient control. In many waste water treatment plants nutrient dosing is carried out without taking into account the fluctuations in the organic load or the hydraulic loading. This is appropriate in systems that show few variations. When large fluctuations of the organic or hydraulic load occur, overdosing may take place if the dosing is not adjusted. For these systems, on-line control and dosing of nutrients according to the volumetric flow is a feasible option.\nTechnique IV. On-line measurements\nOn-line analysers for nutrients offer the operator the possibility of real-time recording of data curves for the chosen sampling points. Considering these data, operators can react in due time if target values are exceeded in the effluents or peak loads in the inflow or if larger variations of the process stability of the waste water treatment plant occur. Low targets for nutrient emission levels, control of the removal efficiency and requirements regarding process stability and control of the waste water treatment result in an increased use of on-line measurement devices. The greater time and staff requirements of the conventional methods and their lack of flexibility are other reasons for their use. However, on-line measurements are more expensive and still require frequent calibration and maintenance to be reliable. For smaller mills on-line measurements may be too expensive.\n\nTechnique V. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) reduction and prevention of bulking sludge\nFor separation of the solid biomass from the purified process water, sedimentation tanks are mostly used. Maintaining a good settleability of the activated sludge and avoiding formation of bulking sludge is therefore crucial. Apart from the appropriate dimensioning and operation of clarifiers (surface load of the secondary clarifier or hydraulic load), monitoring and control of the microbial composition of the biomass is essential. A massive growth of certain microorganism species, especially of filamentous bacteria, often indicates a degeneration of the activated sludge and leads to increased losses of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). \n\nSludge bulking in activated sludge treatment generally appears when there is a disturbance in the biological system, e.g. caused by variations in pollution load, variations in dissolved oxygen in the activated sludge basin, lack or excess of nitrogen and phosphorus or variation in the amount of recycling sludge fed back to the aeration basin.\n\nAppropriate measures to prevent and control the (massive) formation of bulking sludge in biological waste water treatment plants are:\n\nMonitoring of the incoming waste water. Anaerobic zones should be avoided (e.g. by short retention times in the primary clarifier or intermediate aeration) and sufficient nutrient supply guaranteed. In some cases, it appeared that lower carboxylic acids, like acetic acids, were the main cause for prevalent growth of filamentous bacteria, which are responsible for sludge bulking. Filamentous bacteria can also appear when sulphur is present in the effluents.\nAppropriate design of the treatment plant . The food to mass ratio has to be in a certain range in order to avoid bulking sludge and ensure good Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) elimination. For one-stage activated sludge reactors, cascades, plug flow or selector tanks reduce the risk of bulking sludge formation; aeration, oxygen concentration range and the gradient of oxygen concentration are relevant for process efficiency and the prevention of bulking sludge. Two-stage biological treatment better prevents the risk of sludge bulking in the final stage and offers the possibility to operate at a relatively low BOD sludge load. The first stage is often a high-load stage with biofilm carrier material (moving bed biofilm reactor). When the effluent is suitable for anaerobic treatment, a high-loaded anaerobic first biological stage can be built, today generally an expanded granular sludge blanket (Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB)).\nDaily control of the functioning of the treatment plant.\nMicroscopic examination of the activated sludge.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of nitrogen, phosphorus and Total Suspended Solids (TSS).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTechniques I to IV\n\nTable   2 .38 shows examples of Ninorg and tot-P levels achieved by optimised dosing of nutrients and control measurements.\nTable 2.38:\tExample of nutrient control measures and achieved emissions of nine pulp and paper mills\n\n\nTechnique IV (On-line measurements)\nIn a few German paper mills, on-line measurement devices are used for the determination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (EN 1484:1997), rapid-BOD, PO4 (EN 1189:1996), total P (EN 1189:1996), NH4 (DIN 38 406, Part 5) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) (DIN 38 409, Part 27). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the most frequently measured parameter to determine the load of the inflow (process control) or for monitoring the effluent limits. Other mills use on-line measurements for the monitoring of N and P concentrations in the effluents or for control of the N- and P-dosing; dosing of flocculants in the case of P removal is another application. In German paper mills, the application of on-line measurements for process control of waste water treatment plants is still limited to about 10 mills (5 % of the total number) although on-line devices are readily available, because results for Total Organic Carbon (TOC), NH4, PO4 and total P are largely reliable (proper maintenance and trained staff provided) , , . On-line measurement devices have a shorter payback time for larger mills since the costs for possible inappropriate dosing of nutrients are relatively higher for them.

In pulp and paper mill effluents, the amount of nutrients is normally low compared with the amount of organic substances. It is therefore often necessary to add phosphorus and nitrogen to the waste water to achieve efficient treatment. However, it is recommendable to assess whether the initial nutrient supply in the waste water is sufficient. In some cases, e.g. if eucalyptus is used as a raw material, enough phosphorus is present in the waste water and no or only little additional nitrogen is needed. In controlling the functionality of the biological waste water treatment the following aspects are of importance.\n\nTechnique I. Sufficient nutrient supply of the microorganisms\nMicroorganisms in biological waste water treatment plants need a sufficient N and P supply to break down the dissolved organic substances in the waste water. Effluents from pulp and paper mills mostly contain only low concentrations of N and P so, for the effective operation of the biological waste water treatment plant, nutrients e.g. in the form of urea and phosphoric acid are added. An exception are mills pulping wood from Iberian eucalyptus, from which higher amounts of phosphorus are released during pulping. No phosphorus is added to the biological treatment plants treating effluents from eucalyptus pulp mills.\n\nThe addition of nutrients is carried out with readily available nutrient compounds, preferably ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-). In some cases, higher concentrations of nutrients are carried with the process water (sometimes with varying concentration and composition). In these cases and also when water flows vary, excess nutrients are measured after the biological treatment plant if the dosage is not adjusted accordingly. The operator of the biological treatment plant has to find the right balance between insufficient supply of N and P to the biological system and undesired overdose. Insufficient nutrient supply may damage the biocoenosis (see paragraph on 'bulking sludge' below) and may subsequently reduce the removal rate of the plant. An overdose is undesired because released excess nutrients increase eutrophication in water bodies.\n\nMany mills do not consider the content of N and P in the inflowing process water or the variation of hydraulic loading and time-proportionally add the same amount of nutrients to the waste water continuously. However, in some cases organic nitrogen compounds are introduced into the waste water by the used chemical additives that are hydrolysed in the biological system and converted into ammonium. This can result in a situation where the concentration of biologically useable nitrogen exceeds the need of the biological system. The need for nutrients varies between mills. As a maximum theoretical demand, a ratio of BOD:N:P of 100:5:1 is required . In practice, ratios of 100:2.3 - 2.5:0.5 are also successfully applied in a number of treatment plants.\n\nTechnique II. Nutrient dosage\nThe nutrient requirements of the different aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems vary within certain limits. The appropriate nutrient supply can be controlled from three different sides.\n\n(a) From the inlet into the biological waste water treatment plant. It should initially be based on a ratio of BOD:N:P in the influent to the aerobic biological stage of about 100:3.0:0.5 and then be optimised according to the real needs. Since it has proved very difficult to reliably determine the BOD of waste water in due time (analysis is too slow) some mills use (on-line) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as a parameter, applying an initial ratio of reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P of 100:1:0.2. Others continuously measure the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) for the regulation of the nutrient dosage. \n(b) From the treated effluents. For sufficient nutrient supply the yearly average values \nafter the biological treatment should be: 0.5 - 1 mg/l NH4-N and 0.5 - 1 mg/l PO4-P \n or referring to all measured values, e.g. over a complete year, single measurement values between 0 and 2 mg/l.\n\nTreatment plants with very stable operational conditions and few load fluctuations may need lower average concentrations as indicated under point (b), especially with regard to P. The given target values are derived from experience and are intended to give only a rough orientation. Every biological system needs to be optimised and fine-tuned case by case.\n\n(c) By analysing the biomass itself. The control of the effluent concentration in activated sludge systems often does not provide clear evidence for an optimised nutrient supply of the biomass. The composition of the biomass should be monitored by an analysis of the ash content, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total P of the activated sludge samplings, especially if the sludge characteristics are unfavourable, or the degradation capacity of the treatment plant does not meet expectations. The target values for the analysed activated sludge sampling are (based on dry solids):\n\nP: >10 mg Total P/g Dry Solids (DS))\nN: 50 - 60 mg TKN/g Dry Solids (DS)).\n\nThe P supply in particular has a very strong influence on the sludge properties (sludge volume index). The sludge volume index should be determined daily or weekly. It is one of the most important parameters for controlling an activated sludge process. The microorganisms ought to be checked by microscopy weekly.\n\nFor combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plants, it should be noted that the anaerobic bacteria have lower nutrient requirements than the aerobic. The optimal ratio of N and P for the organic load must be determined in each case. Experience has shown that a ratio of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P:S of 350:5:1:1 gives good results . It was found that reducing the dosage of nutrients to the lower needs of anaerobic biomass results in operating conditions that are too unstable for the following aerobic stage. It is therefore necessary to dose in the inlet of the anaerobic stage the N and P necessary for the subsequent aerobic treatment. \n\nTechnique III. Control of the nutrient dosing\nFor an optimised dosing of nutrients, the most appropriate control parameter has to be chosen for every plant. When measuring N and P concentrations in the inlet, especially for nitrogen the bioavailability of the nitrogen species should be taken into account. The measurement of NH4-N is not always sufficient, e.g. when significant quantities of organic compounds (measured as Kjeldahl nitrogen) that are present in the waste water are transformed into bioavailable ammonium compounds. In turn, not all organic N compounds (TKN) are useable by the microorganisms and will partially pass unchanged the biological treatment. Excess ammonia and dissolved total P or PO43--P in the effluent after the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), together with N % and P % of sludge and its settleability, are the key parameters to be monitored for nutrient dosing. On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement may complete the control.\n\nA suitable control of the nutrients dosing is essential for economic and environmental reasons. The control of the N- and P-dosing as a function of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) load is a suitable approach for the control of the nutrient dosing. For the dosing, empirically determined ratios of Total Organic Carbon (TOC):N:P can be used taking into account the continuously measured concentrations of N and P in the untreated waste water. On-line Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements and on-line measurement of N and P especially for larger plants are appropriate tools for nutrient control. In many waste water treatment plants nutrient dosing is carried out without taking into account the fluctuations in the organic load or the hydraulic loading. This is appropriate in systems that show few variations. When large fluctuations of the organic or hydraulic load occur, overdosing may take place if the dosing is not adjusted. For these systems, on-line control and dosing of nutrients according to the volumetric flow is a feasible option.\nTechnique IV. On-line measurements\nOn-line analysers for nutrients offer the operator the possibility of real-time recording of data curves for the chosen sampling points. Considering these data, operators can react in due time if target values are exceeded in the effluents or peak loads in the inflow or if larger variations of the process stability of the waste water treatment plant occur. Low targets for nutrient emission levels, control of the removal efficiency and requirements regarding process stability and control of the waste water treatment result in an increased use of on-line measurement devices. The greater time and staff requirements of the conventional methods and their lack of flexibility are other reasons for their use. However, on-line measurements are more expensive and still require frequent calibration and maintenance to be reliable. For smaller mills on-line measurements may be too expensive.\n\nTechnique V. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) reduction and prevention of bulking sludge\nFor separation of the solid biomass from the purified process water, sedimentation tanks are mostly used. Maintaining a good settleability of the activated sludge and avoiding formation of bulking sludge is therefore crucial. Apart from the appropriate dimensioning and operation of clarifiers (surface load of the secondary clarifier or hydraulic load), monitoring and control of the microbial composition of the biomass is essential. A massive growth of certain microorganism species, especially of filamentous bacteria, often indicates a degeneration of the activated sludge and leads to increased losses of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). \n\nSludge bulking in activated sludge treatment generally appears when there is a disturbance in the biological system, e.g. caused by variations in pollution load, variations in dissolved oxygen in the activated sludge basin, lack or excess of nitrogen and phosphorus or variation in the amount of recycling sludge fed back to the aeration basin.\n\nAppropriate measures to prevent and control the (massive) formation of bulking sludge in biological waste water treatment plants are:\n\nMonitoring of the incoming waste water. Anaerobic zones should be avoided (e.g. by short retention times in the primary clarifier or intermediate aeration) and sufficient nutrient supply guaranteed. In some cases, it appeared that lower carboxylic acids, like acetic acids, were the main cause for prevalent growth of filamentous bacteria, which are responsible for sludge bulking. Filamentous bacteria can also appear when sulphur is present in the effluents.\nAppropriate design of the treatment plant . The food to mass ratio has to be in a certain range in order to avoid bulking sludge and ensure good Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) elimination. For one-stage activated sludge reactors, cascades, plug flow or selector tanks reduce the risk of bulking sludge formation; aeration, oxygen concentration range and the gradient of oxygen concentration are relevant for process efficiency and the prevention of bulking sludge. Two-stage biological treatment better prevents the risk of sludge bulking in the final stage and offers the possibility to operate at a relatively low BOD sludge load. The first stage is often a high-load stage with biofilm carrier material (moving bed biofilm reactor). When the effluent is suitable for anaerobic treatment, a high-loaded anaerobic first biological stage can be built, today generally an expanded granular sludge blanket (Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB)).\nDaily control of the functioning of the treatment plant.\nMicroscopic examination of the activated sludge.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of nitrogen, phosphorus and Total Suspended Solids (TSS).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTechniques I to IV\n\nTable   2 .38 shows examples of Ninorg and tot-P levels achieved by optimised dosing of nutrients and control measurements.\nTable 2.38:\tExample of nutrient control measures and achieved emissions of nine pulp and paper mills\n\n\nTechnique IV (On-line measurements)\nIn a few German paper mills, on-line measurement devices are used for the determination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (EN 1484:1997), rapid-BOD, PO4 (EN 1189:1996), total P (EN 1189:1996), NH4 (DIN 38 406, Part 5) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) (DIN 38 409, Part 27). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the most frequently measured parameter to determine the load of the inflow (process control) or for monitoring the effluent limits. Other mills use on-line measurements for the monitoring of N and P concentrations in the effluents or for control of the N- and P-dosing; dosing of flocculants in the case of P removal is another application. In German paper mills, the application of on-line measurements for process control of waste water treatment plants is still limited to about 10 mills (5 % of the total number) although on-line devices are readily available, because results for Total Organic Carbon (TOC), NH4, PO4 and total P are largely reliable (proper maintenance and trained staff provided) , , .

An overdose is undesired because released excess nutrients increase eutrophication in water bodies.\n\nMany mills do not consider the content of N and P in the inflowing process water or the variation of hydraulic loading and time-proportionally add the same amount of nutrients to the waste water continuously. However, in some cases organic nitrogen compounds are introduced into the waste water by the used chemical additives that are hydrolysed in the biological system and converted into ammonium. This can result in a situation where the concentration of biologically useable nitrogen exceeds the need of the biological system. The need for nutrients varies between mills. As a maximum theoretical demand, a ratio of BOD:N:P of 100:5:1 is required . In practice, ratios of 100:2.3 - 2.5:0.5 are also successfully applied in a number of treatment plants.\n\nTechnique II. Nutrient dosage\nThe nutrient requirements of the different aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems vary within certain limits. The appropriate nutrient supply can be controlled from three different sides.\n\n(a) From the inlet into the biological waste water treatment plant. It should initially be based on a ratio of BOD:N:P in the influent to the aerobic biological stage of about 100:3.0:0.5 and then be optimised according to the real needs. Since it has proved very difficult to reliably determine the BOD of waste water in due time (analysis is too slow) some mills use (on-line) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as a parameter, applying an initial ratio of reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P of 100:1:0.2. Others continuously measure the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) for the regulation of the nutrient dosage. \n(b) From the treated effluents. For sufficient nutrient supply the yearly average values \nafter the biological treatment should be: 0.5 - 1 mg/l NH4-N and 0.5 - 1 mg/l PO4-P \n or referring to all measured values, e.g. over a complete year, single measurement values between 0 and 2 mg/l.\n\nTreatment plants with very stable operational conditions and few load fluctuations may need lower average concentrations as indicated under point (b), especially with regard to P. The given target values are derived from experience and are intended to give only a rough orientation. Every biological system needs to be optimised and fine-tuned case by case.\n\n(c) By analysing the biomass itself. The control of the effluent concentration in activated sludge systems often does not provide clear evidence for an optimised nutrient supply of the biomass. The composition of the biomass should be monitored by an analysis of the ash content, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total P of the activated sludge samplings, especially if the sludge characteristics are unfavourable, or the degradation capacity of the treatment plant does not meet expectations. The target values for the analysed activated sludge sampling are (based on dry solids):\n\nP: >10 mg Total P/g Dry Solids (DS))\nN: 50 - 60 mg TKN/g Dry Solids (DS)).\n\nThe P supply in particular has a very strong influence on the sludge properties (sludge volume index). The sludge volume index should be determined daily or weekly. It is one of the most important parameters for controlling an activated sludge process. The microorganisms ought to be checked by microscopy weekly.\n\nFor combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plants, it should be noted that the anaerobic bacteria have lower nutrient requirements than the aerobic. The optimal ratio of N and P for the organic load must be determined in each case. Experience has shown that a ratio of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P:S of 350:5:1:1 gives good results . It was found that reducing the dosage of nutrients to the lower needs of anaerobic biomass results in operating conditions that are too unstable for the following aerobic stage. It is therefore necessary to dose in the inlet of the anaerobic stage the N and P necessary for the subsequent aerobic treatment. \n\nTechnique III. Control of the nutrient dosing\nFor an optimised dosing of nutrients, the most appropriate control parameter has to be chosen for every plant. When measuring N and P concentrations in the inlet, especially for nitrogen the bioavailability of the nitrogen species should be taken into account. The measurement of NH4-N is not always sufficient, e.g. when significant quantities of organic compounds (measured as Kjeldahl nitrogen) that are present in the waste water are transformed into bioavailable ammonium compounds. In turn, not all organic N compounds (TKN) are useable by the microorganisms and will partially pass unchanged the biological treatment. Excess ammonia and dissolved total P or PO43--P in the effluent after the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), together with N % and P % of sludge and its settleability, are the key parameters to be monitored for nutrient dosing. On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement may complete the control.\n\nA suitable control of the nutrients dosing is essential for economic and environmental reasons. The control of the N- and P-dosing as a function of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) load is a suitable approach for the control of the nutrient dosing. For the dosing, empirically determined ratios of Total Organic Carbon (TOC):N:P can be used taking into account the continuously measured concentrations of N and P in the untreated waste water. On-line Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements and on-line measurement of N and P especially for larger plants are appropriate tools for nutrient control. In many waste water treatment plants nutrient dosing is carried out without taking into account the fluctuations in the organic load or the hydraulic loading. This is appropriate in systems that show few variations. When large fluctuations of the organic or hydraulic load occur, overdosing may take place if the dosing is not adjusted. For these systems, on-line control and dosing of nutrients according to the volumetric flow is a feasible option.\nTechnique IV. On-line measurements\nOn-line analysers for nutrients offer the operator the possibility of real-time recording of data curves for the chosen sampling points. Considering these data, operators can react in due time if target values are exceeded in the effluents or peak loads in the inflow or if larger variations of the process stability of the waste water treatment plant occur. Low targets for nutrient emission levels, control of the removal efficiency and requirements regarding process stability and control of the waste water treatment result in an increased use of on-line measurement devices. The greater time and staff requirements of the conventional methods and their lack of flexibility are other reasons for their use. However, on-line measurements are more expensive and still require frequent calibration and maintenance to be reliable. For smaller mills on-line measurements may be too expensive.\n\nTechnique V. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) reduction and prevention of bulking sludge\nFor separation of the solid biomass from the purified process water, sedimentation tanks are mostly used. Maintaining a good settleability of the activated sludge and avoiding formation of bulking sludge is therefore crucial. Apart from the appropriate dimensioning and operation of clarifiers (surface load of the secondary clarifier or hydraulic load), monitoring and control of the microbial composition of the biomass is essential. A massive growth of certain microorganism species, especially of filamentous bacteria, often indicates a degeneration of the activated sludge and leads to increased losses of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). \n\nSludge bulking in activated sludge treatment generally appears when there is a disturbance in the biological system, e.g. caused by variations in pollution load, variations in dissolved oxygen in the activated sludge basin, lack or excess of nitrogen and phosphorus or variation in the amount of recycling sludge fed back to the aeration basin.\n\nAppropriate measures to prevent and control the (massive) formation of bulking sludge in biological waste water treatment plants are:\n\nMonitoring of the incoming waste water. Anaerobic zones should be avoided (e.g. by short retention times in the primary clarifier or intermediate aeration) and sufficient nutrient supply guaranteed. In some cases, it appeared that lower carboxylic acids, like acetic acids, were the main cause for prevalent growth of filamentous bacteria, which are responsible for sludge bulking. Filamentous bacteria can also appear when sulphur is present in the effluents.\nAppropriate design of the treatment plant . The food to mass ratio has to be in a certain range in order to avoid bulking sludge and ensure good Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) elimination. For one-stage activated sludge reactors, cascades, plug flow or selector tanks reduce the risk of bulking sludge formation; aeration, oxygen concentration range and the gradient of oxygen concentration are relevant for process efficiency and the prevention of bulking sludge. Two-stage biological treatment better prevents the risk of sludge bulking in the final stage and offers the possibility to operate at a relatively low BOD sludge load. The first stage is often a high-load stage with biofilm carrier material (moving bed biofilm reactor). When the effluent is suitable for anaerobic treatment, a high-loaded anaerobic first biological stage can be built, today generally an expanded granular sludge blanket (Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB)).\nDaily control of the functioning of the treatment plant.\nMicroscopic examination of the activated sludge.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of nitrogen, phosphorus and Total Suspended Solids (TSS).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTechniques I to IV\n\nTable   2 .38 shows examples of Ninorg and tot-P levels achieved by optimised dosing of nutrients and control measurements.\nTable 2.38:\tExample of nutrient control measures and achieved emissions of nine pulp and paper mills\n\n\nTechnique IV (On-line measurements)\nIn a few German paper mills, on-line measurement devices are used for the determination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (EN 1484:1997), rapid-BOD, PO4 (EN 1189:1996), total P (EN 1189:1996), NH4 (DIN 38 406, Part 5) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) (DIN 38 409, Part 27). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the most frequently measured parameter to determine the load of the inflow (process control) or for monitoring the effluent limits. Other mills use on-line measurements for the monitoring of N and P concentrations in the effluents or for control of the N- and P-dosing; dosing of flocculants in the case of P removal is another application. In German paper mills, the application of on-line measurements for process control of waste water treatment plants is still limited to about 10 mills (5 % of the total number) although on-line devices are readily available, because results for Total Organic Carbon (TOC), NH4, PO4 and total P are largely reliable (proper maintenance and trained staff provided) , , . On-line measurement devices have a shorter payback time for larger mills since the costs for possible inappropriate dosing of nutrients are relatively higher for them. To assess the economic viability of on-line measurements, the costs (investment, expenses for chemicals, replacement parts and maintenance contracts) and benefits have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis\n\nCross-media effects\nNone reported.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to all mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nRequirements of the competent authorities.

In pulp and paper mill effluents, the amount of nutrients is normally low compared with the amount of organic substances. It is therefore often necessary to add phosphorus and nitrogen to the waste water to achieve efficient treatment. However, it is recommendable to assess whether the initial nutrient supply in the waste water is sufficient. In some cases, e.g. if eucalyptus is used as a raw material, enough phosphorus is present in the waste water and no or only little additional nitrogen is needed. In controlling the functionality of the biological waste water treatment the following aspects are of importance.\n\nTechnique I. Sufficient nutrient supply of the microorganisms\nMicroorganisms in biological waste water treatment plants need a sufficient N and P supply to break down the dissolved organic substances in the waste water. Effluents from pulp and paper mills mostly contain only low concentrations of N and P so, for the effective operation of the biological waste water treatment plant, nutrients e.g. in the form of urea and phosphoric acid are added. An exception are mills pulping wood from Iberian eucalyptus, from which higher amounts of phosphorus are released during pulping. No phosphorus is added to the biological treatment plants treating effluents from eucalyptus pulp mills.\n\nThe addition of nutrients is carried out with readily available nutrient compounds, preferably ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-). In some cases, higher concentrations of nutrients are carried with the process water (sometimes with varying concentration and composition). In these cases and also when water flows vary, excess nutrients are measured after the biological treatment plant if the dosage is not adjusted accordingly. The operator of the biological treatment plant has to find the right balance between insufficient supply of N and P to the biological system and undesired overdose. Insufficient nutrient supply may damage the biocoenosis (see paragraph on 'bulking sludge' below) and may subsequently reduce the removal rate of the plant. An overdose is undesired because released excess nutrients increase eutrophication in water bodies.\n\nMany mills do not consider the content of N and P in the inflowing process water or the variation of hydraulic loading and time-proportionally add the same amount of nutrients to the waste water continuously. However, in some cases organic nitrogen compounds are introduced into the waste water by the used chemical additives that are hydrolysed in the biological system and converted into ammonium.

The given target values are derived from experience and are intended to give only a rough orientation. Every biological system needs to be optimised and fine-tuned case by case.\n\n(c) By analysing the biomass itself. The control of the effluent concentration in activated sludge systems often does not provide clear evidence for an optimised nutrient supply of the biomass. The composition of the biomass should be monitored by an analysis of the ash content, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total P of the activated sludge samplings, especially if the sludge characteristics are unfavourable, or the degradation capacity of the treatment plant does not meet expectations. The target values for the analysed activated sludge sampling are (based on dry solids):\n\nP: >10 mg Total P/g Dry Solids (DS))\nN: 50 - 60 mg TKN/g Dry Solids (DS)).\n\nThe P supply in particular has a very strong influence on the sludge properties (sludge volume index). The sludge volume index should be determined daily or weekly. It is one of the most important parameters for controlling an activated sludge process. The microorganisms ought to be checked by microscopy weekly.\n\nFor combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plants, it should be noted that the anaerobic bacteria have lower nutrient requirements than the aerobic. The optimal ratio of N and P for the organic load must be determined in each case. Experience has shown that a ratio of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P:S of 350:5:1:1 gives good results . It was found that reducing the dosage of nutrients to the lower needs of anaerobic biomass results in operating conditions that are too unstable for the following aerobic stage. It is therefore necessary to dose in the inlet of the anaerobic stage the N and P necessary for the subsequent aerobic treatment. \n\nTechnique III. Control of the nutrient dosing\nFor an optimised dosing of nutrients, the most appropriate control parameter has to be chosen for every plant. When measuring N and P concentrations in the inlet, especially for nitrogen the bioavailability of the nitrogen species should be taken into account. The measurement of NH4-N is not always sufficient, e.g. when significant quantities of organic compounds (measured as Kjeldahl nitrogen) that are present in the waste water are transformed into bioavailable ammonium compounds. In turn, not all organic N compounds (TKN) are useable by the microorganisms and will partially pass unchanged the biological treatment. Excess ammonia and dissolved total P or PO43--P in the effluent after the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), together with N % and P % of sludge and its settleability, are the key parameters to be monitored for nutrient dosing. On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement may complete the control.\n\nA suitable control of the nutrients dosing is essential for economic and environmental reasons. The control of the N- and P-dosing as a function of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) load is a suitable approach for the control of the nutrient dosing. For the dosing, empirically determined ratios of Total Organic Carbon (TOC):N:P can be used taking into account the continuously measured concentrations of N and P in the untreated waste water. On-line Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements and on-line measurement of N and P especially for larger plants are appropriate tools for nutrient control. In many waste water treatment plants nutrient dosing is carried out without taking into account the fluctuations in the organic load or the hydraulic loading. This is appropriate in systems that show few variations. When large fluctuations of the organic or hydraulic load occur, overdosing may take place if the dosing is not adjusted. For these systems, on-line control and dosing of nutrients according to the volumetric flow is a feasible option.\nTechnique IV. On-line measurements\nOn-line analysers for nutrients offer the operator the possibility of real-time recording of data curves for the chosen sampling points. Considering these data, operators can react in due time if target values are exceeded in the effluents or peak loads in the inflow or if larger variations of the process stability of the waste water treatment plant occur. Low targets for nutrient emission levels, control of the removal efficiency and requirements regarding process stability and control of the waste water treatment result in an increased use of on-line measurement devices. The greater time and staff requirements of the conventional methods and their lack of flexibility are other reasons for their use. However, on-line measurements are more expensive and still require frequent calibration and maintenance to be reliable. For smaller mills on-line measurements may be too expensive.\n\nTechnique V. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) reduction and prevention of bulking sludge\nFor separation of the solid biomass from the purified process water, sedimentation tanks are mostly used. Maintaining a good settleability of the activated sludge and avoiding formation of bulking sludge is therefore crucial. Apart from the appropriate dimensioning and operation of clarifiers (surface load of the secondary clarifier or hydraulic load), monitoring and control of the microbial composition of the biomass is essential. A massive growth of certain microorganism species, especially of filamentous bacteria, often indicates a degeneration of the activated sludge and leads to increased losses of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). \n\nSludge bulking in activated sludge treatment generally appears when there is a disturbance in the biological system, e.g. caused by variations in pollution load, variations in dissolved oxygen in the activated sludge basin, lack or excess of nitrogen and phosphorus or variation in the amount of recycling sludge fed back to the aeration basin.\n\nAppropriate measures to prevent and control the (massive) formation of bulking sludge in biological waste water treatment plants are:\n\nMonitoring of the incoming waste water. Anaerobic zones should be avoided (e.g. by short retention times in the primary clarifier or intermediate aeration) and sufficient nutrient supply guaranteed. In some cases, it appeared that lower carboxylic acids, like acetic acids, were the main cause for prevalent growth of filamentous bacteria, which are responsible for sludge bulking. Filamentous bacteria can also appear when sulphur is present in the effluents.\nAppropriate design of the treatment plant . The food to mass ratio has to be in a certain range in order to avoid bulking sludge and ensure good Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) elimination. For one-stage activated sludge reactors, cascades, plug flow or selector tanks reduce the risk of bulking sludge formation; aeration, oxygen concentration range and the gradient of oxygen concentration are relevant for process efficiency and the prevention of bulking sludge. Two-stage biological treatment better prevents the risk of sludge bulking in the final stage and offers the possibility to operate at a relatively low BOD sludge load. The first stage is often a high-load stage with biofilm carrier material (moving bed biofilm reactor). When the effluent is suitable for anaerobic treatment, a high-loaded anaerobic first biological stage can be built, today generally an expanded granular sludge blanket (Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB)).\nDaily control of the functioning of the treatment plant.\nMicroscopic examination of the activated sludge.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of nitrogen, phosphorus and Total Suspended Solids (TSS).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTechniques I to IV\n\nTable   2 .38 shows examples of Ninorg and tot-P levels achieved by optimised dosing of nutrients and control measurements.\nTable 2.38:\tExample of nutrient control measures and achieved emissions of nine pulp and paper mills\n\n\nTechnique IV (On-line measurements)\nIn a few German paper mills, on-line measurement devices are used for the determination of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) (EN 1484:1997), rapid-BOD, PO4 (EN 1189:1996), total P (EN 1189:1996), NH4 (DIN 38 406, Part 5) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) (DIN 38 409, Part 27). Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the most frequently measured parameter to determine the load of the inflow (process control) or for monitoring the effluent limits. Other mills use on-line measurements for the monitoring of N and P concentrations in the effluents or for control of the N- and P-dosing; dosing of flocculants in the case of P removal is another application. In German paper mills, the application of on-line measurements for process control of waste water treatment plants is still limited to about 10 mills (5 % of the total number) although on-line devices are readily available, because results for Total Organic Carbon (TOC), NH4, PO4 and total P are largely reliable (proper maintenance and trained staff provided) , , . On-line measurement devices have a shorter payback time for larger mills since the costs for possible inappropriate dosing of nutrients are relatively higher for them.

In pulp and paper mill effluents, the amount of nutrients is normally low compared with the amount of organic substances. It is therefore often necessary to add phosphorus and nitrogen to the waste water to achieve efficient treatment. However, it is recommendable to assess whether the initial nutrient supply in the waste water is sufficient. In some cases, e.g. if eucalyptus is used as a raw material, enough phosphorus is present in the waste water and no or only little additional nitrogen is needed. In controlling the functionality of the biological waste water treatment the following aspects are of importance.\n\nTechnique I. Sufficient nutrient supply of the microorganisms\nMicroorganisms in biological waste water treatment plants need a sufficient N and P supply to break down the dissolved organic substances in the waste water. Effluents from pulp and paper mills mostly contain only low concentrations of N and P so, for the effective operation of the biological waste water treatment plant, nutrients e.g. in the form of urea and phosphoric acid are added. An exception are mills pulping wood from Iberian eucalyptus, from which higher amounts of phosphorus are released during pulping. No phosphorus is added to the biological treatment plants treating effluents from eucalyptus pulp mills.\n\nThe addition of nutrients is carried out with readily available nutrient compounds, preferably ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-). In some cases, higher concentrations of nutrients are carried with the process water (sometimes with varying concentration and composition). In these cases and also when water flows vary, excess nutrients are measured after the biological treatment plant if the dosage is not adjusted accordingly. The operator of the biological treatment plant has to find the right balance between insufficient supply of N and P to the biological system and undesired overdose. Insufficient nutrient supply may damage the biocoenosis (see paragraph on 'bulking sludge' below) and may subsequently reduce the removal rate of the plant. An overdose is undesired because released excess nutrients increase eutrophication in water bodies.\n\nMany mills do not consider the content of N and P in the inflowing process water or the variation of hydraulic loading and time-proportionally add the same amount of nutrients to the waste water continuously. However, in some cases organic nitrogen compounds are introduced into the waste water by the used chemical additives that are hydrolysed in the biological system and converted into ammonium. This can result in a situation where the concentration of biologically useable nitrogen exceeds the need of the biological system. The need for nutrients varies between mills. As a maximum theoretical demand, a ratio of BOD:N:P of 100:5:1 is required . In practice, ratios of 100:2.3 - 2.5:0.5 are also successfully applied in a number of treatment plants.\n\nTechnique II. Nutrient dosage\nThe nutrient requirements of the different aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment systems vary within certain limits. The appropriate nutrient supply can be controlled from three different sides.\n\n(a) From the inlet into the biological waste water treatment plant. It should initially be based on a ratio of BOD:N:P in the influent to the aerobic biological stage of about 100:3.0:0.5 and then be optimised according to the real needs. Since it has proved very difficult to reliably determine the BOD of waste water in due time (analysis is too slow) some mills use (on-line) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as a parameter, applying an initial ratio of reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P of 100:1:0.2. Others continuously measure the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen Bound (TNb) for the regulation of the nutrient dosage. \n(b) From the treated effluents. For sufficient nutrient supply the yearly average values \nafter the biological treatment should be: 0.5 - 1 mg/l NH4-N and 0.5 - 1 mg/l PO4-P \n or referring to all measured values, e.g. over a complete year, single measurement values between 0 and 2 mg/l.\n\nTreatment plants with very stable operational conditions and few load fluctuations may need lower average concentrations as indicated under point (b), especially with regard to P. The given target values are derived from experience and are intended to give only a rough orientation. Every biological system needs to be optimised and fine-tuned case by case.\n\n(c) By analysing the biomass itself. The control of the effluent concentration in activated sludge systems often does not provide clear evidence for an optimised nutrient supply of the biomass. The composition of the biomass should be monitored by an analysis of the ash content, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total P of the activated sludge samplings, especially if the sludge characteristics are unfavourable, or the degradation capacity of the treatment plant does not meet expectations. The target values for the analysed activated sludge sampling are (based on dry solids):\n\nP: >10 mg Total P/g Dry Solids (DS))\nN: 50 - 60 mg TKN/g Dry Solids (DS)).\n\nThe P supply in particular has a very strong influence on the sludge properties (sludge volume index). The sludge volume index should be determined daily or weekly. It is one of the most important parameters for controlling an activated sludge process. The microorganisms ought to be checked by microscopy weekly.\n\nFor combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plants, it should be noted that the anaerobic bacteria have lower nutrient requirements than the aerobic. The optimal ratio of N and P for the organic load must be determined in each case. Experience has shown that a ratio of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P:S of 350:5:1:1 gives good results . It was found that reducing the dosage of nutrients to the lower needs of anaerobic biomass results in operating conditions that are too unstable for the following aerobic stage. It is therefore necessary to dose in the inlet of the anaerobic stage the N and P necessary for the subsequent aerobic treatment. \n\nTechnique III. Control of the nutrient dosing\nFor an optimised dosing of nutrients, the most appropriate control parameter has to be chosen for every plant. When measuring N and P concentrations in the inlet, especially for nitrogen the bioavailability of the nitrogen species should be taken into account. The measurement of NH4-N is not always sufficient, e.g. when significant quantities of organic compounds (measured as Kjeldahl nitrogen) that are present in the waste water are transformed into bioavailable ammonium compounds. In turn, not all organic N compounds (TKN) are useable by the microorganisms and will partially pass unchanged the biological treatment. Excess ammonia and dissolved total P or PO43--P in the effluent after the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), together with N % and P % of sludge and its settleability, are the key parameters to be monitored for nutrient dosing. On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement may complete the control.\n\nA suitable control of the nutrients dosing is essential for economic and environmental reasons. The control of the N- and P-dosing as a function of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) load is a suitable approach for the control of the nutrient dosing. For the dosing, empirically determined ratios of Total Organic Carbon (TOC):N:P can be used taking into account the continuously measured concentrations of N and P in the untreated waste water. On-line Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements and on-line measurement of N and P especially for larger plants are appropriate tools for nutrient control. In many waste water treatment plants nutrient dosing is carried out without taking into account the fluctuations in the organic load or the hydraulic loading. This is appropriate in systems that show few variations. When large fluctuations of the organic or hydraulic load occur, overdosing may take place if the dosing is not adjusted. For these systems, on-line control and dosing of nutrients according to the volumetric flow is a feasible option.\nTechnique IV. On-line measurements\nOn-line analysers for nutrients offer the operator the possibility of real-time recording of data curves for the chosen sampling points. Considering these data, operators can react in due time if target values are exceeded in the effluents or peak loads in the inflow or if larger variations of the process stability of the waste water treatment plant occur. Low targets for nutrient emission levels, control of the removal efficiency and requirements regarding process stability and control of the waste water treatment result in an increased use of on-line measurement devices. The greater time and staff requirements of the conventional methods and their lack of flexibility are other reasons for their use. However, on-line measurements are more expensive and still require frequent calibration and maintenance to be reliable. For smaller mills on-line measurements may be too expensive.\n\nTechnique V. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) reduction and prevention of bulking sludge\nFor separation of the solid biomass from the purified process water, sedimentation tanks are mostly used. Maintaining a good settleability of the activated sludge and avoiding formation of bulking sludge is therefore crucial.

It is therefore often necessary to add phosphorus and nitrogen to the waste water to achieve efficient treatment. However, it is recommendable to assess whether the initial nutrient supply in the waste water is sufficient. In some cases, e.g. if eucalyptus is used as a raw material, enough phosphorus is present in the waste water and no or only little additional nitrogen is needed. In controlling the functionality of the biological waste water treatment the following aspects are of importance.\n\nTechnique I. Sufficient nutrient supply of the microorganisms\nMicroorganisms in biological waste water treatment plants need a sufficient N and P supply to break down the dissolved organic substances in the waste water. Effluents from pulp and paper mills mostly contain only low concentrations of N and P so, for the effective operation of the biological waste water treatment plant, nutrients e.g. in the form of urea and phosphoric acid are added.

No phosphorus is added to the biological treatment plants treating effluents from eucalyptus pulp mills.\n\nThe addition of nutrients is carried out with readily available nutrient compounds, preferably ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-). In some cases, higher concentrations of nutrients are carried with the process water (sometimes with varying concentration and composition). In these cases and also when water flows vary, excess nutrients are measured after the biological treatment plant if the dosage is not adjusted accordingly. The operator of the biological treatment plant has to find the right balance between insufficient supply of N and P to the biological system and undesired overdose. Insufficient nutrient supply may damage the biocoenosis (see paragraph on 'bulking sludge' below) and may subsequently reduce the removal rate of the plant. An overdose is undesired because released excess nutrients increase eutrophication in water bodies.\n\nMany mills do not consider the content of N and P in the inflowing process water or the variation of hydraulic loading and time-proportionally add the same amount of nutrients to the waste water continuously. However, in some cases organic nitrogen compounds are introduced into the waste water by the used chemical additives that are hydrolysed in the biological system and converted into ammonium. This can result in a situation where the concentration of biologically useable nitrogen exceeds the need of the biological system. The need for nutrients varies between mills. As a maximum theoretical demand, a ratio of BOD:N:P of 100:5:1 is required . In practice, ratios of 100:2.3 - 2.5:0.5 are also successfully applied in a number of treatment plants.\n\nTechnique II.

For sufficient nutrient supply the yearly average values \nafter the biological treatment should be: 0.5 - 1 mg/l NH4-N and 0.5 - 1 mg/l PO4-P \n or referring to all measured values, e.g. over a complete year, single measurement values between 0 and 2 mg/l.\n\nTreatment plants with very stable operational conditions and few load fluctuations may need lower average concentrations as indicated under point (b), especially with regard to P. The given target values are derived from experience and are intended to give only a rough orientation. Every biological system needs to be optimised and fine-tuned case by case.\n\n(c) By analysing the biomass itself. The control of the effluent concentration in activated sludge systems often does not provide clear evidence for an optimised nutrient supply of the biomass. The composition of the biomass should be monitored by an analysis of the ash content, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total P of the activated sludge samplings, especially if the sludge characteristics are unfavourable, or the degradation capacity of the treatment plant does not meet expectations. The target values for the analysed activated sludge sampling are (based on dry solids):\n\nP: >10 mg Total P/g Dry Solids (DS))\nN: 50 - 60 mg TKN/g Dry Solids (DS)).\n\nThe P supply in particular has a very strong influence on the sludge properties (sludge volume index). The sludge volume index should be determined daily or weekly. It is one of the most important parameters for controlling an activated sludge process. The microorganisms ought to be checked by microscopy weekly.\n\nFor combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plants, it should be noted that the anaerobic bacteria have lower nutrient requirements than the aerobic. The optimal ratio of N and P for the organic load must be determined in each case. Experience has shown that a ratio of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD):N:P:S of 350:5:1:1 gives good results . It was found that reducing the dosage of nutrients to the lower needs of anaerobic biomass results in operating conditions that are too unstable for the following aerobic stage. It is therefore necessary to dose in the inlet of the anaerobic stage the N and P necessary for the subsequent aerobic treatment. \n\nTechnique III. Control of the nutrient dosing\nFor an optimised dosing of nutrients, the most appropriate control parameter has to be chosen for every plant. When measuring N and P concentrations in the inlet, especially for nitrogen the bioavailability of the nitrogen species should be taken into account. The measurement of NH4-N is not always sufficient, e.g. when significant quantities of organic compounds (measured as Kjeldahl nitrogen) that are present in the waste water are transformed into bioavailable ammonium compounds. In turn, not all organic N compounds (TKN) are useable by the microorganisms and will partially pass unchanged the biological treatment. Excess ammonia and dissolved total P or PO43--P in the effluent after the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), together with N % and P % of sludge and its settleability, are the key parameters to be monitored for nutrient dosing. On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurement may complete the control.\n\nA suitable control of the nutrients dosing is essential for economic and environmental reasons. The control of the N- and P-dosing as a function of the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) load is a suitable approach for the control of the nutrient dosing. For the dosing, empirically determined ratios of Total Organic Carbon (TOC):N:P can be used taking into account the continuously measured concentrations of N and P in the untreated waste water. On-line Total Organic Carbon (TOC) measurements and on-line measurement of N and P especially for larger plants are appropriate tools for nutrient control. In many waste water treatment plants nutrient dosing is carried out without taking into account the fluctuations in the organic load or the hydraulic loading. This is appropriate in systems that show few variations. When large fluctuations of the organic or hydraulic load occur, overdosing may take place if the dosing is not adjusted. For these systems, on-line control and dosing of nutrients according to the volumetric flow is a feasible option.\nTechnique IV. On-line measurements\nOn-line analysers for nutrients offer the operator the possibility of real-time recording of data curves for the chosen sampling points. Considering these data, operators can react in due time if target values are exceeded in the effluents or peak loads in the inflow or if larger variations of the process stability of the waste water treatment plant occur. Low targets for nutrient emission levels, control of the removal efficiency and requirements regarding process stability and control of the waste water treatment result in an increased use of on-line measurement devices. The greater time and staff requirements of the conventional methods and their lack of flexibility are other reasons for their use. However, on-line measurements are more expensive and still require frequent calibration and maintenance to be reliable. For smaller mills on-line measurements may be too expensive.\n\nTechnique V. Total Suspended Solids (TSS) reduction and prevention of bulking sludge\nFor separation of the solid biomass from the purified process water, sedimentation tanks are mostly used. Maintaining a good settleability of the activated sludge and avoiding formation of bulking sludge is therefore crucial. Apart from the appropriate dimensioning and operation of clarifiers (surface load of the secondary clarifier or hydraulic load), monitoring and control of the microbial composition of the biomass is essential. A massive growth of certain microorganism species, especially of filamentous bacteria, often indicates a degeneration of the activated sludge and leads to increased losses of Total Suspended Solids (TSS). \n\nSludge bulking in activated sludge treatment generally appears when there is a disturbance in the biological system, e.g. caused by variations in pollution load, variations in dissolved oxygen in the activated sludge basin, lack or excess of nitrogen and phosphorus or variation in the amount of recycling sludge fed back to the aeration basin.\n\nAppropriate measures to prevent and control the (massive) formation of bulking sludge in biological waste water treatment plants are:\n\nMonitoring of the incoming waste water. Anaerobic zones should be avoided (e.g. by short retention times in the primary clarifier or intermediate aeration) and sufficient nutrient supply guaranteed. In some cases, it appeared that lower carboxylic acids, like acetic acids, were the main cause for prevalent growth of filamentous bacteria, which are responsible for sludge bulking. Filamentous bacteria can also appear when sulphur is present in the effluents.\nAppropriate design of the treatment plant . The food to mass ratio has to be in a certain range in order to avoid bulking sludge and ensure good Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) elimination. For one-stage activated sludge reactors, cascades, plug flow or selector tanks reduce the risk of bulking sludge formation; aeration, oxygen concentration range and the gradient of oxygen concentration are relevant for process efficiency and the prevention of bulking sludge. Two-stage biological treatment better prevents the risk of sludge bulking in the final stage and offers the possibility to operate at a relatively low BOD sludge load. The first stage is often a high-load stage with biofilm carrier material (moving bed biofilm reactor).

Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the most frequently measured parameter to determine the load of the inflow (process control) or for monitoring the effluent limits. Other mills use on-line measurements for the monitoring of N and P concentrations in the effluents or for control of the N- and P-dosing; dosing of flocculants in the case of P removal is another application. In German paper mills, the application of on-line measurements for process control of waste water treatment plants is still limited to about 10 mills (5 % of the total number) although on-line devices are readily available, because results for Total Organic Carbon (TOC), NH4, PO4 and total P are largely reliable (proper maintenance and trained staff provided) , , . On-line measurement devices have a shorter payback time for larger mills since the costs for possible inappropriate dosing of nutrients are relatively higher for them. To assess the economic viability of on-line measurements, the costs (investment, expenses for chemicals, replacement parts and maintenance contracts) and benefits have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis\n\nCross-media effects\nNone reported.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to all mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nRequirements of the competent authorities. Cost reductions for nutrients dosing. Quality objectives for N and P in water bodies.

Depending on the characteristics of the pulp in-feed and the used chemicals in papermaking, the closed-up water systems can have an adverse effect on the runnability of the machine, the quality of the end product and even the production costs due to increased use of chemicals. These potential negative effects need to be controlled. The possible advantages and disadvantages of reducing water consumption are given in Table   7 .185. However, at water consumption levels as presented in Section 7.3.1, no adverse effects should occur if the water circuits are operated, maintained and controlled in a suitable manner.\n\nTable 7.185:\tPossible advantages and drawbacks of increased closure of water circuits in paper mills\n\n\nThe pulp and the water carrying the fibres contain dissolved and colloidal organic compounds called 'anionic trash'. At higher concentrations, these organic substances affect the retention and formation of the paper web and increase the plugging of machine press felts and cause sticking of the paper web on machine rolls. \n\nIn the production of food packaging materials, the product must be free of harmful soluble matter. The temperature increase at the paper or board machine also needs to be controlled so that operating temperature limits, 45 - 55 degC, at the wet end are not exceeded. On the other hand, on the paper machine wire section, a hot pulp suspension is advantageous because the viscosity of water is decreased with increasing temperature, resulting in improved dewatering.\n\nThe measures for controlling the undesired effects of closed-up water circuits are given below.\n\nThe paper or board machine white water system does not receive water from integrated pulping departments or from parallel machines. The separation of water loops is usually carried out with thickeners. The optimum design of water loops is crucial.\nThe recycled cooling or sealing water and clean white water feed to machine showers are treated with an appropriate strainer to protect against the plugging or wear of machine equipment.\nRecycled sealing water is cooled sufficiently by heat exchangers or clean make-up water. The vacuum pump performance especially limits the allowable sealing water temperature. \nThe composition (e.g. presence of colloidal substances), hardness, pH and temperature of recycled waters fed to a specific use must be compatible with the equipment or the process streams. It is beneficial to determine the water quality that is really needed.\nIn integrated mills, the pulps should be efficiently washed prior to being fed to the paper mill to reduce the content of dissolved or colloidal substances. In those mills, it would also be beneficial to increase the consistency of the pulp fed to the paper mill to over 30 % instead of the typical 2 - 4 % in order to reduce the carry-over of dissolved matter. This can help to decrease the consumption of chemical additives such as alum, polymer or starch and machine aids like washing chemicals, slimicides and biocides.\nThe selection of the chemical additives has to be reassessed when closed-loop principles are applied because some chemicals behave very differently in the changed chemical environment.\nThe monitoring of recycled water streams by on-line meters and lab analysis is beneficial to prevent target quality limits from being exceeded.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe measures are an integral part of the measure described in Section 7.3.1. They support these measures to achieve and maintain low fresh water consumption without significant adverse effects.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe risk of scaling caused by calcium compounds, slime and pitch problems is pronounced and must be counteracted with an appropriate mixing of water fractions, pH control, increased dosage of machine aids or an appropriate purge of calcium out of the system (see Section 6.3.5).\nIf the machine can be operated at over 50 degC, the growth of microorganisms and their activity in the water system is diminished. But anaerobic activity may still occur above 50 degC (thermophilic bacteria), generating odour in the sulphur- and carbohydrate-rich environment that needs to be controlled.\n\nThe optimisation required by the implementation of these control measures is usually carried out gradually over a longer period of time in existing mills. The success in applying this technology depends on the wet-end chemistry case by case. Some mills have controlled the possible adverse effects of closing up the water circuits just by using more chemical additives. The selection of proper chemical additives and their combination is a fairly sophisticated procedure and is often poorly understood, but is necessary to obtain maximum runnability and low costs and environmental impact. \n\nCross-media effects\nIn some cases the need for chemical additives and paper machine aid chemicals will increase. The type of chemicals used must be reassessed to maximise the suitability for a certain paper grade.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures can be applied both at new and existing mills. However, existing mills usually need many years to implement most of these improvements. The required level of measures varies for individual cases: the machine type, the product(s) and the degree of closure are the key parameters. The requirements are the least stringent for the production of unbleached packaging grades and get stricter for high-quality grades, such as fine papers. \n\nElevated dissolved or colloidal matter concentrations due to increased process water recycling tend to retain more of these substances in the end product. Limits to this are set by the product quality and the acceptable consumption of papermaking chemicals.\n\nAlso in sealing and cooling water applications, the stream temperature and dissolved and particulate solids concentrations are limiting factors. The latter must be dealt with using cleaning equipment and/or sufficient bleedout.\n\nFor sealing, mechanical seals that do not need any fresh water are also available.\n\nControl of paper machine water and recycle quality calls for improved control and monitoring of the pulping process as well.\n\nEconomics\nThe costs of the measures depend on the number and nature of rearrangements necessary and the type of additional installations needed. No data on single costs are available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe enhanced recycling of process water in paper mills can have adverse effects on the runnability of the machine and the quality of the end product. These potential negative effects need to be controlled when paper mills are aiming at low water consumption.\n\n\nExample plants\nNumerous mills in Europe. Economical paper production has been successfully implemented in numerous partially closed-cycle mills, even for high-speed paper machines. Through the use of enhanced recycle water purification (see Sections 7.3.3, 6.3.4 and 6.3.11), certain problems can be solved and machine control with chemicals reduced.\n\nReference literature\n.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4049650_abstract", "x": 0.5041731, "y": 0.25567943, "title": "BLEACHING COMPOSITION FOR KERATIN FIBERS", "year": 2022, "text": "The present invention is directed to a kit-of-parts for bleaching keratin fibers, having a bleaching composition A comprising a) one or more persalt(s) and/or peroxy salt(s), and b) one or more alkalizing agent(s), an aqueous oxidizing composition B, and a composition C comprising c) one or more non-acetylated sugar alcohol(s), and/or their mixtures, wherein the bleaching composition A comprises less than 5% by weight of water, calculated to the total weight of the bleaching composition A.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.7\" title=\"TCF bleaching\">\n<references_to>3.1.7, 3.3.6, 3.3.8</references_to>\n<referenced_by>3.2.2.5.2, 3.3.6, 3.3.13, 4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching\n\nDescription\nTotally chlorine free (Totally Chlorine Free (TCF)) bleaching is a bleaching process carried out without any chlorine-containing chemicals, thereby avoiding the generation of organically bound chlorine in the pulp and waste water stream. In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching, hydrogen peroxide (P) together with ozone (Z) or peracetic acid (Paa) are the most commonly used chemicals. Provided that the pulp has a low enough kappa number after cooking and oxygen delignification, i.e. before the pulp enters the bleach plant, and that transition metals (e.g. Mn2+) have been removed in the necessary chelating stages (Q stages), it is possible to attain full market brightness with peroxide as the sole bleaching chemical. However, the dose-response curve for brightness versus peroxide consumption is quite shallow at top brightness, which means that even small disturbances in the incoming kappa number can result in rather high bleaching costs and the downgrading of the pulp because of low brightness.\nOne possible option of reducing the hydrogen peroxide consumption is to introduce an ozone stage into the sequence in a position before the peroxide stage (ZQP). Ozone bleaching is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching (see Section 3.3.6). The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards peroxide and this results in greater brightness and lower peroxide consumption. Ozone is very efficient to reduce the amount of peroxide required to obtain even very high brightness levels. A drawback with ozone is that, in larger charges, it has a tendency to attack the cellulose chains. \n\nOzone is generated by means of silent electrical discharges in a stream of oxygen gas. Ozone bleaching (O3) requires a high investment due to the high costs of ozone generators and auxiliary equipment for ozone generation. Since the ozone concentration in oxygen will only be about 12 - 16 %, fairly large volumes of oxygen are required. Thus, the operating cost is rather high due to the relatively high cost of oxygen (needed for ozone generation) as well as to the high power consumption. On the other hand, the efficiency of ozone is much higher than for other bleaching chemicals (e.g. it has about twice the oxidising potential of chlorine dioxide). \n\nPeracids have now become commercially available in the form of, for example, peracetic acid (Paa). This bleaching chemical is a valuable complement in a stage preceding hydrogen peroxide where it can replace ozone. Full brightness can be achieved even when the unbleached pulp has a slightly higher kappa number than the very lowest.

Ozone activates the fibres towards hydrogen peroxide and these result in a greater brightness and a somewhat lower hydrogen peroxide consumption. On the other hand, the selectivity of ozone is poor. Excessive application, too high a temperature or application of other unsuitable treatments may lead to serious cellulose degradation. Ozone should preferably be applied under acidic conditions (pH ~2 - 3). Too high a temperature (>70 degC) impairs the selectivity. High pressure increases the solubility of ozone in the aqueous phase during bleaching (dissolved ozone is claimed to be less aggressive to the carbohydrates than ozone in the gas phase). Pulp consistency is an important parameter in ozone bleaching. Installations for ozone bleaching operate under medium consistency (8 - 15 %) or high consistency (>30 %) conditions.\n\nIf ozone is applied, a new on-site chemical manufacturing unit is necessary because of the rapid decomposition of ozone in transportation or storage.

In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills the use of ozone and other chlorine free bleaching chemicals makes it less complicated to close up the filtrate streams from washing stages (see Section 3.3.8). In addition to preventing environmentally damaging waste water streams where the latest technology is applied, this technique also allows Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills to reduce the fresh water demand from approximately 25 - 50 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) to 10 - 20 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). By eliminating chlorine from the bleaching process, Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching also eliminates the environmental risk inherent in the storage of chlorine and preparation of chlorine dioxide.\n\nAt modern kraft pulp mills, from an environmental point of view the focus should be less on the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) or Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching technique and more on the combination and efficiency of a set of techniques such as optimised cooking, bleaching and washing processes, an efficient waste water treatment and the overall impact of the mill (raw materials, energy and water consumption, impact of the liquid effluent). Also refer to Section 3.1.7 'The discussion about modern Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) versus Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching'.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching is now a well-established technology. Many mills in Europe have the possibility to produce Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp in separate campaigns instead of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp depending on the market demand. A few mills manufacture Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp only. Slightly higher production costs and no improvement in the product quality have however limited the demand, and the share of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps has not increased.\n\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills discharge virtually no chlorinated organics (no formation in bleaching).\n\nCross-media effects\nAt the time of writing (2013), there are no significant differences in chemical and energy consumption when comparing an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) alternative. Even if the bleaching operation has a slightly higher energy consumption, the overall energy performance of a Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mill is no higher than that of an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) mill.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable to kraft mills. Ozone bleaching is related to the production of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps and in a few cases it is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching.\n\nIn existing mills, a chelating stage, a new oxygen stage and a washer are usually needed to convert the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching sequence to Totally Chlorine Free (TCF). If hydrogen peroxide or ozone stages are used, two new bleaching towers are used and the bleaching filters are reconstructed. Ozone bleaching requires ozone generators and reactor.\n\nIn new greenfield mills, fewer modifications and lower investments are required but operating costs are likely to be in the same order of magnitude.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for peroxide bleaching at new mills with a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d production rate is EUR 7 - 8 million, at existing pulp mills the costs are EUR 2 - 5 million depending on the materials of the existing bleaching equipment. If the materials tolerate hydrogen peroxide, the costs are EUR 2 - 3 million. Operating costs with peroxide bleaching are considerably higher than with Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching due to the higher chemical costs, EUR 18 - 21 million/yr.\n\nIf both ozone and peroxide bleaching are applied, the investment required is higher. The investment for a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d ozone bleaching system is EUR 12 - 15 million. Corresponding operating costs are EUR 1.8 - 2.1 million/yr. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe AOX emissions to water are reduced and chlorine-organic compounds are not formed in the Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching. Also, the increased public awareness of the environmental and health effects of persistent organically bound chlorine compounds since the 1980s and a regulatory response to this issue in many jurisdictions have been the primary drivers of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching implementation. By eliminating the production of such compounds in the bleaching process, Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching offered both legal compliance and filled an emerging demand in environmentally aware markets. In addition, the adoption of a precautionary approach to environmental issues was also a driver of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) implementation.\n\nExample plants\nA few plants in Europe and elsewhere in the world, e.g. SCA Ostrands, Sodra Cell mills in Monsteras, Morrum and Varo.\n\nReference literature\n, , , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3815671_abstract", "x": 0.36302838, "y": 0.1921673, "title": "BLEACHING COMPOSITION", "year": 2021, "text": "The present invention relates to a bleaching composition for keratin fibres, especially human hair, comprising at least one compound with bleaching effect and two different silicate based alkalizing agents.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.7\" title=\"TCF bleaching\">\n<references_to>3.1.7, 3.3.6, 3.3.8</references_to>\n<referenced_by>3.2.2.5.2, 3.3.6, 3.3.13, 4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching\n\nDescription\nTotally chlorine free (Totally Chlorine Free (TCF)) bleaching is a bleaching process carried out without any chlorine-containing chemicals, thereby avoiding the generation of organically bound chlorine in the pulp and waste water stream. In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching, hydrogen peroxide (P) together with ozone (Z) or peracetic acid (Paa) are the most commonly used chemicals. Provided that the pulp has a low enough kappa number after cooking and oxygen delignification, i.e. before the pulp enters the bleach plant, and that transition metals (e.g. Mn2+) have been removed in the necessary chelating stages (Q stages), it is possible to attain full market brightness with peroxide as the sole bleaching chemical. However, the dose-response curve for brightness versus peroxide consumption is quite shallow at top brightness, which means that even small disturbances in the incoming kappa number can result in rather high bleaching costs and the downgrading of the pulp because of low brightness.\nOne possible option of reducing the hydrogen peroxide consumption is to introduce an ozone stage into the sequence in a position before the peroxide stage (ZQP). Ozone bleaching is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching (see Section 3.3.6). The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards peroxide and this results in greater brightness and lower peroxide consumption. Ozone is very efficient to reduce the amount of peroxide required to obtain even very high brightness levels. A drawback with ozone is that, in larger charges, it has a tendency to attack the cellulose chains. \n\nOzone is generated by means of silent electrical discharges in a stream of oxygen gas. Ozone bleaching (O3) requires a high investment due to the high costs of ozone generators and auxiliary equipment for ozone generation. Since the ozone concentration in oxygen will only be about 12 - 16 %, fairly large volumes of oxygen are required. Thus, the operating cost is rather high due to the relatively high cost of oxygen (needed for ozone generation) as well as to the high power consumption. On the other hand, the efficiency of ozone is much higher than for other bleaching chemicals (e.g. it has about twice the oxidising potential of chlorine dioxide). \n\nPeracids have now become commercially available in the form of, for example, peracetic acid (Paa). This bleaching chemical is a valuable complement in a stage preceding hydrogen peroxide where it can replace ozone. Full brightness can be achieved even when the unbleached pulp has a slightly higher kappa number than the very lowest.

Many mills in Europe have the possibility to produce Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp in separate campaigns instead of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp depending on the market demand. A few mills manufacture Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp only.

Ozone bleaching requires ozone generators and reactor.\n\nIn new greenfield mills, fewer modifications and lower investments are required but operating costs are likely to be in the same order of magnitude.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for peroxide bleaching at new mills with a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d production rate is EUR 7 - 8 million, at existing pulp mills the costs are EUR 2 - 5 million depending on the materials of the existing bleaching equipment. If the materials tolerate hydrogen peroxide, the costs are EUR 2 - 3 million. Operating costs with peroxide bleaching are considerably higher than with Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching due to the higher chemical costs, EUR 18 - 21 million/yr.\n\nIf both ozone and peroxide bleaching are applied, the investment required is higher.

In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching, hydrogen peroxide (P) together with ozone (Z) or peracetic acid (Paa) are the most commonly used chemicals. Provided that the pulp has a low enough kappa number after cooking and oxygen delignification, i.e. before the pulp enters the bleach plant, and that transition metals (e.g. Mn2+) have been removed in the necessary chelating stages (Q stages), it is possible to attain full market brightness with peroxide as the sole bleaching chemical. However, the dose-response curve for brightness versus peroxide consumption is quite shallow at top brightness, which means that even small disturbances in the incoming kappa number can result in rather high bleaching costs and the downgrading of the pulp because of low brightness.\nOne possible option of reducing the hydrogen peroxide consumption is to introduce an ozone stage into the sequence in a position before the peroxide stage (ZQP). Ozone bleaching is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching (see Section 3.3.6). The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards peroxide and this results in greater brightness and lower peroxide consumption. Ozone is very efficient to reduce the amount of peroxide required to obtain even very high brightness levels. A drawback with ozone is that, in larger charges, it has a tendency to attack the cellulose chains. \n\nOzone is generated by means of silent electrical discharges in a stream of oxygen gas. Ozone bleaching (O3) requires a high investment due to the high costs of ozone generators and auxiliary equipment for ozone generation. Since the ozone concentration in oxygen will only be about 12 - 16 %, fairly large volumes of oxygen are required. Thus, the operating cost is rather high due to the relatively high cost of oxygen (needed for ozone generation) as well as to the high power consumption. On the other hand, the efficiency of ozone is much higher than for other bleaching chemicals (e.g. it has about twice the oxidising potential of chlorine dioxide). \n\nPeracids have now become commercially available in the form of, for example, peracetic acid (Paa). This bleaching chemical is a valuable complement in a stage preceding hydrogen peroxide where it can replace ozone. Full brightness can be achieved even when the unbleached pulp has a slightly higher kappa number than the very lowest. The drawback with peracetic acid is its still rather high cost.\n\nExamples of different Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences are listed in Table   3 .64.\n\n\nTable 3.64:\tBleaching sequences for Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) softwood and hardwood kraft pulping\n\n\nThe first Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequence was based on peroxide under alkaline conditions and an extensive use of hydrogen peroxide is still the main feature of all Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. Decomposition of peroxide is catalysed by certain metal ions which have to be removed in an acidic stage before the peroxide stage. \n\nPeroxide can be applied in several positions or several different ways:\n\nreinforcement of a mild initial oxygen stage (low or moderate charge): OP\nreinforcement of alkaline extraction stages (low charge): EP\nfinal brightness adjustment in high-density storage towers (low charge): P\nseparate delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): P\nseparate pressurised delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): PO. \n\nPretreatment of the pulp with a suitable electrophilic agent before peroxide bleaching may 'activate' the fibres and improve their response to peroxide. Ozone can promote this kind of effect.\n\nOzone has become the most common complements to peroxide in Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards hydrogen peroxide and these result in a greater brightness and a somewhat lower hydrogen peroxide consumption. On the other hand, the selectivity of ozone is poor. Excessive application, too high a temperature or application of other unsuitable treatments may lead to serious cellulose degradation. Ozone should preferably be applied under acidic conditions (pH ~2 - 3). Too high a temperature (>70 degC) impairs the selectivity. High pressure increases the solubility of ozone in the aqueous phase during bleaching (dissolved ozone is claimed to be less aggressive to the carbohydrates than ozone in the gas phase). Pulp consistency is an important parameter in ozone bleaching. Installations for ozone bleaching operate under medium consistency (8 - 15 %) or high consistency (>30 %) conditions.\n\nIf ozone is applied, a new on-site chemical manufacturing unit is necessary because of the rapid decomposition of ozone in transportation or storage. The operating costs of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulping are usually somewhat higher than those of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulping.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching the formation of AOX is not detectable.

In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching, hydrogen peroxide (P) together with ozone (Z) or peracetic acid (Paa) are the most commonly used chemicals. Provided that the pulp has a low enough kappa number after cooking and oxygen delignification, i.e. before the pulp enters the bleach plant, and that transition metals (e.g. Mn2+) have been removed in the necessary chelating stages (Q stages), it is possible to attain full market brightness with peroxide as the sole bleaching chemical. However, the dose-response curve for brightness versus peroxide consumption is quite shallow at top brightness, which means that even small disturbances in the incoming kappa number can result in rather high bleaching costs and the downgrading of the pulp because of low brightness.\nOne possible option of reducing the hydrogen peroxide consumption is to introduce an ozone stage into the sequence in a position before the peroxide stage (ZQP). Ozone bleaching is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching (see Section 3.3.6). The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards peroxide and this results in greater brightness and lower peroxide consumption. Ozone is very efficient to reduce the amount of peroxide required to obtain even very high brightness levels. A drawback with ozone is that, in larger charges, it has a tendency to attack the cellulose chains. \n\nOzone is generated by means of silent electrical discharges in a stream of oxygen gas. Ozone bleaching (O3) requires a high investment due to the high costs of ozone generators and auxiliary equipment for ozone generation. Since the ozone concentration in oxygen will only be about 12 - 16 %, fairly large volumes of oxygen are required. Thus, the operating cost is rather high due to the relatively high cost of oxygen (needed for ozone generation) as well as to the high power consumption. On the other hand, the efficiency of ozone is much higher than for other bleaching chemicals (e.g. it has about twice the oxidising potential of chlorine dioxide). \n\nPeracids have now become commercially available in the form of, for example, peracetic acid (Paa). This bleaching chemical is a valuable complement in a stage preceding hydrogen peroxide where it can replace ozone. Full brightness can be achieved even when the unbleached pulp has a slightly higher kappa number than the very lowest. The drawback with peracetic acid is its still rather high cost.\n\nExamples of different Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences are listed in Table   3 .64.\n\n\nTable 3.64:\tBleaching sequences for Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) softwood and hardwood kraft pulping\n\n\nThe first Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequence was based on peroxide under alkaline conditions and an extensive use of hydrogen peroxide is still the main feature of all Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. Decomposition of peroxide is catalysed by certain metal ions which have to be removed in an acidic stage before the peroxide stage. \n\nPeroxide can be applied in several positions or several different ways:\n\nreinforcement of a mild initial oxygen stage (low or moderate charge): OP\nreinforcement of alkaline extraction stages (low charge): EP\nfinal brightness adjustment in high-density storage towers (low charge): P\nseparate delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): P\nseparate pressurised delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): PO. \n\nPretreatment of the pulp with a suitable electrophilic agent before peroxide bleaching may 'activate' the fibres and improve their response to peroxide. Ozone can promote this kind of effect.\n\nOzone has become the most common complements to peroxide in Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards hydrogen peroxide and these result in a greater brightness and a somewhat lower hydrogen peroxide consumption. On the other hand, the selectivity of ozone is poor. Excessive application, too high a temperature or application of other unsuitable treatments may lead to serious cellulose degradation. Ozone should preferably be applied under acidic conditions (pH ~2 - 3). Too high a temperature (>70 degC) impairs the selectivity. High pressure increases the solubility of ozone in the aqueous phase during bleaching (dissolved ozone is claimed to be less aggressive to the carbohydrates than ozone in the gas phase). Pulp consistency is an important parameter in ozone bleaching. Installations for ozone bleaching operate under medium consistency (8 - 15 %) or high consistency (>30 %) conditions.\n\nIf ozone is applied, a new on-site chemical manufacturing unit is necessary because of the rapid decomposition of ozone in transportation or storage. The operating costs of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulping are usually somewhat higher than those of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulping.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching the formation of AOX is not detectable. In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills the use of ozone and other chlorine free bleaching chemicals makes it less complicated to close up the filtrate streams from washing stages (see Section 3.3.8). In addition to preventing environmentally damaging waste water streams where the latest technology is applied, this technique also allows Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills to reduce the fresh water demand from approximately 25 - 50 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) to 10 - 20 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). By eliminating chlorine from the bleaching process, Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching also eliminates the environmental risk inherent in the storage of chlorine and preparation of chlorine dioxide.\n\nAt modern kraft pulp mills, from an environmental point of view the focus should be less on the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) or Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching technique and more on the combination and efficiency of a set of techniques such as optimised cooking, bleaching and washing processes, an efficient waste water treatment and the overall impact of the mill (raw materials, energy and water consumption, impact of the liquid effluent). Also refer to Section 3.1.7 'The discussion about modern Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) versus Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching'.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching is now a well-established technology. Many mills in Europe have the possibility to produce Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp in separate campaigns instead of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp depending on the market demand. A few mills manufacture Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp only. Slightly higher production costs and no improvement in the product quality have however limited the demand, and the share of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps has not increased.\n\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills discharge virtually no chlorinated organics (no formation in bleaching).\n\nCross-media effects\nAt the time of writing (2013), there are no significant differences in chemical and energy consumption when comparing an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) alternative. Even if the bleaching operation has a slightly higher energy consumption, the overall energy performance of a Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mill is no higher than that of an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) mill.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable to kraft mills.

In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching, hydrogen peroxide (P) together with ozone (Z) or peracetic acid (Paa) are the most commonly used chemicals. Provided that the pulp has a low enough kappa number after cooking and oxygen delignification, i.e. before the pulp enters the bleach plant, and that transition metals (e.g. Mn2+) have been removed in the necessary chelating stages (Q stages), it is possible to attain full market brightness with peroxide as the sole bleaching chemical. However, the dose-response curve for brightness versus peroxide consumption is quite shallow at top brightness, which means that even small disturbances in the incoming kappa number can result in rather high bleaching costs and the downgrading of the pulp because of low brightness.\nOne possible option of reducing the hydrogen peroxide consumption is to introduce an ozone stage into the sequence in a position before the peroxide stage (ZQP). Ozone bleaching is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching (see Section 3.3.6). The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards peroxide and this results in greater brightness and lower peroxide consumption. Ozone is very efficient to reduce the amount of peroxide required to obtain even very high brightness levels. A drawback with ozone is that, in larger charges, it has a tendency to attack the cellulose chains. \n\nOzone is generated by means of silent electrical discharges in a stream of oxygen gas. Ozone bleaching (O3) requires a high investment due to the high costs of ozone generators and auxiliary equipment for ozone generation. Since the ozone concentration in oxygen will only be about 12 - 16 %, fairly large volumes of oxygen are required. Thus, the operating cost is rather high due to the relatively high cost of oxygen (needed for ozone generation) as well as to the high power consumption. On the other hand, the efficiency of ozone is much higher than for other bleaching chemicals (e.g. it has about twice the oxidising potential of chlorine dioxide). \n\nPeracids have now become commercially available in the form of, for example, peracetic acid (Paa). This bleaching chemical is a valuable complement in a stage preceding hydrogen peroxide where it can replace ozone. Full brightness can be achieved even when the unbleached pulp has a slightly higher kappa number than the very lowest. The drawback with peracetic acid is its still rather high cost.\n\nExamples of different Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences are listed in Table   3 .64.\n\n\nTable 3.64:\tBleaching sequences for Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) softwood and hardwood kraft pulping\n\n\nThe first Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequence was based on peroxide under alkaline conditions and an extensive use of hydrogen peroxide is still the main feature of all Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. Decomposition of peroxide is catalysed by certain metal ions which have to be removed in an acidic stage before the peroxide stage. \n\nPeroxide can be applied in several positions or several different ways:\n\nreinforcement of a mild initial oxygen stage (low or moderate charge): OP\nreinforcement of alkaline extraction stages (low charge): EP\nfinal brightness adjustment in high-density storage towers (low charge): P\nseparate delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): P\nseparate pressurised delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): PO. \n\nPretreatment of the pulp with a suitable electrophilic agent before peroxide bleaching may 'activate' the fibres and improve their response to peroxide. Ozone can promote this kind of effect.\n\nOzone has become the most common complements to peroxide in Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards hydrogen peroxide and these result in a greater brightness and a somewhat lower hydrogen peroxide consumption. On the other hand, the selectivity of ozone is poor. Excessive application, too high a temperature or application of other unsuitable treatments may lead to serious cellulose degradation. Ozone should preferably be applied under acidic conditions (pH ~2 - 3). Too high a temperature (>70 degC) impairs the selectivity. High pressure increases the solubility of ozone in the aqueous phase during bleaching (dissolved ozone is claimed to be less aggressive to the carbohydrates than ozone in the gas phase). Pulp consistency is an important parameter in ozone bleaching. Installations for ozone bleaching operate under medium consistency (8 - 15 %) or high consistency (>30 %) conditions.\n\nIf ozone is applied, a new on-site chemical manufacturing unit is necessary because of the rapid decomposition of ozone in transportation or storage. The operating costs of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulping are usually somewhat higher than those of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulping.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching the formation of AOX is not detectable. In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills the use of ozone and other chlorine free bleaching chemicals makes it less complicated to close up the filtrate streams from washing stages (see Section 3.3.8). In addition to preventing environmentally damaging waste water streams where the latest technology is applied, this technique also allows Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills to reduce the fresh water demand from approximately 25 - 50 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) to 10 - 20 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). By eliminating chlorine from the bleaching process, Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching also eliminates the environmental risk inherent in the storage of chlorine and preparation of chlorine dioxide.\n\nAt modern kraft pulp mills, from an environmental point of view the focus should be less on the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) or Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching technique and more on the combination and efficiency of a set of techniques such as optimised cooking, bleaching and washing processes, an efficient waste water treatment and the overall impact of the mill (raw materials, energy and water consumption, impact of the liquid effluent). Also refer to Section 3.1.7 'The discussion about modern Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) versus Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching'.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching is now a well-established technology. Many mills in Europe have the possibility to produce Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp in separate campaigns instead of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp depending on the market demand. A few mills manufacture Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp only. Slightly higher production costs and no improvement in the product quality have however limited the demand, and the share of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps has not increased.\n\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills discharge virtually no chlorinated organics (no formation in bleaching).\n\nCross-media effects\nAt the time of writing (2013), there are no significant differences in chemical and energy consumption when comparing an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) alternative. Even if the bleaching operation has a slightly higher energy consumption, the overall energy performance of a Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mill is no higher than that of an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) mill.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable to kraft mills. Ozone bleaching is related to the production of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps and in a few cases it is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching.\n\nIn existing mills, a chelating stage, a new oxygen stage and a washer are usually needed to convert the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching sequence to Totally Chlorine Free (TCF). If hydrogen peroxide or ozone stages are used, two new bleaching towers are used and the bleaching filters are reconstructed. Ozone bleaching requires ozone generators and reactor.\n\nIn new greenfield mills, fewer modifications and lower investments are required but operating costs are likely to be in the same order of magnitude.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for peroxide bleaching at new mills with a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d production rate is EUR 7 - 8 million, at existing pulp mills the costs are EUR 2 - 5 million depending on the materials of the existing bleaching equipment. If the materials tolerate hydrogen peroxide, the costs are EUR 2 - 3 million. Operating costs with peroxide bleaching are considerably higher than with Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching due to the higher chemical costs, EUR 18 - 21 million/yr.\n\nIf both ozone and peroxide bleaching are applied, the investment required is higher. The investment for a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d ozone bleaching system is EUR 12 - 15 million. Corresponding operating costs are EUR 1.8 - 2.1 million/yr. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe AOX emissions to water are reduced and chlorine-organic compounds are not formed in the Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching. Also, the increased public awareness of the environmental and health effects of persistent organically bound chlorine compounds since the 1980s and a regulatory response to this issue in many jurisdictions have been the primary drivers of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching implementation.

Provided that the pulp has a low enough kappa number after cooking and oxygen delignification, i.e. before the pulp enters the bleach plant, and that transition metals (e.g. Mn2+) have been removed in the necessary chelating stages (Q stages), it is possible to attain full market brightness with peroxide as the sole bleaching chemical. However, the dose-response curve for brightness versus peroxide consumption is quite shallow at top brightness, which means that even small disturbances in the incoming kappa number can result in rather high bleaching costs and the downgrading of the pulp because of low brightness.\nOne possible option of reducing the hydrogen peroxide consumption is to introduce an ozone stage into the sequence in a position before the peroxide stage (ZQP). Ozone bleaching is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching (see Section 3.3.6). The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards peroxide and this results in greater brightness and lower peroxide consumption. Ozone is very efficient to reduce the amount of peroxide required to obtain even very high brightness levels. A drawback with ozone is that, in larger charges, it has a tendency to attack the cellulose chains. \n\nOzone is generated by means of silent electrical discharges in a stream of oxygen gas. Ozone bleaching (O3) requires a high investment due to the high costs of ozone generators and auxiliary equipment for ozone generation. Since the ozone concentration in oxygen will only be about 12 - 16 %, fairly large volumes of oxygen are required. Thus, the operating cost is rather high due to the relatively high cost of oxygen (needed for ozone generation) as well as to the high power consumption. On the other hand, the efficiency of ozone is much higher than for other bleaching chemicals (e.g. it has about twice the oxidising potential of chlorine dioxide). \n\nPeracids have now become commercially available in the form of, for example, peracetic acid (Paa). This bleaching chemical is a valuable complement in a stage preceding hydrogen peroxide where it can replace ozone. Full brightness can be achieved even when the unbleached pulp has a slightly higher kappa number than the very lowest. The drawback with peracetic acid is its still rather high cost.\n\nExamples of different Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences are listed in Table   3 .64.\n\n\nTable 3.64:\tBleaching sequences for Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) softwood and hardwood kraft pulping\n\n\nThe first Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequence was based on peroxide under alkaline conditions and an extensive use of hydrogen peroxide is still the main feature of all Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. Decomposition of peroxide is catalysed by certain metal ions which have to be removed in an acidic stage before the peroxide stage. \n\nPeroxide can be applied in several positions or several different ways:\n\nreinforcement of a mild initial oxygen stage (low or moderate charge): OP\nreinforcement of alkaline extraction stages (low charge): EP\nfinal brightness adjustment in high-density storage towers (low charge): P\nseparate delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): P\nseparate pressurised delignification/bleaching stage (high charge): PO. \n\nPretreatment of the pulp with a suitable electrophilic agent before peroxide bleaching may 'activate' the fibres and improve their response to peroxide. Ozone can promote this kind of effect.\n\nOzone has become the most common complements to peroxide in Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching sequences. The main purpose of using ozone is to provide more delignification power. Ozone activates the fibres towards hydrogen peroxide and these result in a greater brightness and a somewhat lower hydrogen peroxide consumption. On the other hand, the selectivity of ozone is poor. Excessive application, too high a temperature or application of other unsuitable treatments may lead to serious cellulose degradation. Ozone should preferably be applied under acidic conditions (pH ~2 - 3). Too high a temperature (>70 degC) impairs the selectivity. High pressure increases the solubility of ozone in the aqueous phase during bleaching (dissolved ozone is claimed to be less aggressive to the carbohydrates than ozone in the gas phase). Pulp consistency is an important parameter in ozone bleaching. Installations for ozone bleaching operate under medium consistency (8 - 15 %) or high consistency (>30 %) conditions.\n\nIf ozone is applied, a new on-site chemical manufacturing unit is necessary because of the rapid decomposition of ozone in transportation or storage. The operating costs of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulping are usually somewhat higher than those of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulping.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching the formation of AOX is not detectable. In Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills the use of ozone and other chlorine free bleaching chemicals makes it less complicated to close up the filtrate streams from washing stages (see Section 3.3.8). In addition to preventing environmentally damaging waste water streams where the latest technology is applied, this technique also allows Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills to reduce the fresh water demand from approximately 25 - 50 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) to 10 - 20 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). By eliminating chlorine from the bleaching process, Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching also eliminates the environmental risk inherent in the storage of chlorine and preparation of chlorine dioxide.\n\nAt modern kraft pulp mills, from an environmental point of view the focus should be less on the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) or Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching technique and more on the combination and efficiency of a set of techniques such as optimised cooking, bleaching and washing processes, an efficient waste water treatment and the overall impact of the mill (raw materials, energy and water consumption, impact of the liquid effluent). Also refer to Section 3.1.7 'The discussion about modern Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) versus Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching'.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching is now a well-established technology. Many mills in Europe have the possibility to produce Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp in separate campaigns instead of Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) pulp depending on the market demand. A few mills manufacture Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulp only. Slightly higher production costs and no improvement in the product quality have however limited the demand, and the share of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps has not increased.\n\nTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) mills discharge virtually no chlorinated organics (no formation in bleaching).\n\nCross-media effects\nAt the time of writing (2013), there are no significant differences in chemical and energy consumption when comparing an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) and Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) alternative. Even if the bleaching operation has a slightly higher energy consumption, the overall energy performance of a Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) mill is no higher than that of an Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) mill.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable to kraft mills. Ozone bleaching is related to the production of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) pulps and in a few cases it is also used for Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching.\n\nIn existing mills, a chelating stage, a new oxygen stage and a washer are usually needed to convert the Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching sequence to Totally Chlorine Free (TCF). If hydrogen peroxide or ozone stages are used, two new bleaching towers are used and the bleaching filters are reconstructed. Ozone bleaching requires ozone generators and reactor.\n\nIn new greenfield mills, fewer modifications and lower investments are required but operating costs are likely to be in the same order of magnitude.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for peroxide bleaching at new mills with a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d production rate is EUR 7 - 8 million, at existing pulp mills the costs are EUR 2 - 5 million depending on the materials of the existing bleaching equipment. If the materials tolerate hydrogen peroxide, the costs are EUR 2 - 3 million. Operating costs with peroxide bleaching are considerably higher than with Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) bleaching due to the higher chemical costs, EUR 18 - 21 million/yr.\n\nIf both ozone and peroxide bleaching are applied, the investment required is higher. The investment for a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d ozone bleaching system is EUR 12 - 15 million. Corresponding operating costs are EUR 1.8 - 2.1 million/yr. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe AOX emissions to water are reduced and chlorine-organic compounds are not formed in the Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching. Also, the increased public awareness of the environmental and health effects of persistent organically bound chlorine compounds since the 1980s and a regulatory response to this issue in many jurisdictions have been the primary drivers of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching implementation. By eliminating the production of such compounds in the bleaching process, Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching offered both legal compliance and filled an emerging demand in environmentally aware markets. In addition, the adoption of a precautionary approach to environmental issues was also a driver of Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) implementation.\n\nExample plants\nA few plants in Europe and elsewhere in the world, e.g. SCA Ostrands, Sodra Cell mills in Monsteras, Morrum and Varo.\n\nReference literature\n, , , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2899165_abstract", "x": 0.6122347, "y": 0.30288038, "title": "Ozone injection method and system", "year": 2015, "text": "A method and system of ozone treatment diverts a portion of water from a flow of water in a conduit; injects an ozone-containing gas into the portion to provide an ozonated portion; recombines the ozonated portion with the flow of water in the conduit; and preferably controls and/or regulates the diverted portion to provide a minimum diverted portion flow rate according to flow in the conduit and proportion of ozone in the injected gas.

Selection of fuels\nThe selection of fuels has a significant effect on the emission from the lime kiln. Burning oil in a lime kiln produces lower NOX emissions than natural gas, even though oil contains significant quantities of organic nitrogen that are not present in natural gas. This is because of the higher temperatures of the natural gas flame, which causes the formation of more thermal nitrogen oxide than the burning of oil. The firing of the lime kiln with sawdust, pulverised wood or gases obtained by gasification of biomass (bark) also increases NOX emissions.\n\nIn most cases, burning malodorous gases in a lime kiln results in a significant increase in the Nitric Oxide (NO) level as the malodorous gases carry additional nitrogen to the kiln. Developing low-NOX technology for lime kiln burning, when both malodorous gases and the main fuel are present, will require additional investment, and there is no reliable technical solution available at the time of writing (2013).\n\nII. Optimising lime burning and control of kiln operation\nOptimisation of the kiln operation and/or homogenisation of the fuel and raw material feedings may reduce NOX emissions. Significant parameters for process control optimisation in a lime kiln which lead primarily to better and more stable lime quality and energy savings and can have a positive effect on NOX emissions by being optimised are:\n\ngood mixing of fuel and air;\nair staging (reduced oxygen supply in the primary reaction zone, then increase of oxygen supply);\ncontrol of excess air;\noptimised secondary air temperature;\nflame shape and position and temperature profile;\nlime mud flow control;\nkiln speed, fuel rate and feed rate.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions and energy consumption.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNOX emission data specified according to the technologies used and the operation of the lime kilns for reducing NOX emissions (as listed under II above) have not been provided.

The sulphur content of Concentrated Non-condensable Gases (CNCG) and the fuel oil burnt in the recovery boiler are less significant for the reduction of SO2 emissions.\n\na) SO2 emissions \nSO2 emissions are formed mainly through the oxidation of H2S and carbonyl sulphide (COS) in the lower furnace. The major source of gaseous sulphur emissions is the black liquor (see Table   3 .52) and the sulphur content in additional fired streams such as Concentrated Non-condensable Gases (CNCG). The emission levels are kept low by operating the boiler with a high black liquor dry solids content (higher temperature) and by optimising the combustion parameters such as air supply and mixing of air and fuel. \n\nThe emission of sulphur from the recovery boiler is influenced by the operating variables given below.\n\nTemperature in the different zones which is influenced by the dry solids content (heating value) of the strong black liquor and the amount of combustion air. With higher Dry Solids (DS) feedstock, the combustion temperature increases and causes more sodium (Na) to be vaporised which then takes up the SO2 and forms Na2SO4, thus reducing SO2 emissions from the recovery boiler. On the other hand, the fact that more sulphur is driven off in the evaporation when the dry solids content of the black liquor is raised could reduce the sulphur reaching the recovery boiler if the sulphur-containing odorous gases from evaporation are not burnt in the recovery boiler. A drawback to the higher temperature is that emissions of NOX may increase.\nThe sulphur to sodium ratio (S/Na2) in the liquor (sulphidity). At higher sulphidity levels the release of sodium in the furnace in relation to the sulphur amount may not be sufficient to bind all the sulphur released and thus a share of the sulphur may leave the furnace as sulphur dioxide instead of sodium sulphate. The black liquor having a high dry solids contents may compensate this effect.\nExcess air supply, primary air temperature and distribution of combustion air. \nThe load on the furnace. Operating a recovery boiler in an overloaded mode has an adverse effect on the SO2 emissions characteristics. The load of the furnace is directly proportional to the temperature in the furnace, i.e. when the load of the furnace is changed, the temperature changes accordingly. In some boilers, the SO2 emissions are sensitive to changes in load, i.e. SO2 emissions may change due to the temperature changes in the furnace. SO2 emissions may also increase when the boiler load is reduced. SO2 emissions from other boilers (with very high Dry Solids (DS)) do not react to changes in the boiler load.\n\nAfter conventional evaporation, the Dry Solids (DS) content in the strong black liquor is about 70 %. By installing a concentrator in the evaporation plant, a Dry Solids (DS) content of 80 % or above (85 %) can be achieved. The achievable Dry Solids (DS) content depends partly on the wood species (see Section 3.1.11). \n\nb) Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions \nThe emission of total reduced sulphur (Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)) from the recovery boiler is influenced by almost the same operating variables as the SO2 emissions.\n\nDry solids content. Due to firing black liquor with a high dry solids content there is enough sodium in the flue-gases to bind almost all the sulphur formed in black liquor combustion. Sulphur emissions are very low or even undetectable in fully loaded and stably operated boilers. And if there is enough sodium to bind all the sulphur virtually no SO2 emissions are released.\nLoad on the furnace. The load of the furnace is directly proportional to the temperature in the furnace. Operating a recovery boiler in an overloaded mode may have an adverse effect on the emissions characteristics, especially on the quantity of hydrogen sulphide produced. Rapid changes in the operation mode may generate some momentary Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) peaks. Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from boilers with a very high dry solids content do not react to changes in the boiler load.\nAir distribution. The main controlling factor for the Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the recovery boiler furnace is the mixing of oxygen and sulphur-containing gases. If the gases are well mixed they are converted to SO2. Modern air systems help to achieve sufficient mixing.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of sulphur emissions and maximised electricity production.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWhen boilers burn black liquors with a high Dry Solids (DS) content (about 80 %), SO2 emissions are very low or even zero when the boiler is running in a steady state . The SO2 produced in the furnace reacts with sodium compounds to produce sodium sulphate. With high solids firing, there is enough sodium to bind all sulphur dioxide. However, there are normally still some peak emissions due to unstable operational conditions (see also Section 3.2.2.6.1).\n\nFigure   3 .104 and Figure   3 .105 show the annual average SO2 and Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) (some mills reported H2S only) emissions from recovery boilers fired with varying dry solids contents. For all mills that provided data, both the concentration values (mg/Nm3, 6 % O2) and emission loads (kg S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) are plotted. Dry solids contents below 73 %, between 73 % and 80 %, and above 80 % are indicated.\n\nFigure 3.104:\tSO2 emission concentrations and loads from recovery boilers with different dry solids contents (%) of black liquor and different softwood/hardwood use\n\n\nFigure 3.105:\tTotal Reduced Sulphur (TRS)-S emission concentrations and loads from recovery boilers with different dry solids contents (%) of black liquor and different softwood/hardwood use\n\n\nThe data confirm that Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the recovery boiler are very low or even zero when the boiler is running in a steady state. Normally, there are a number of peaks during the year. Most mills achieve emissions of <5 - 25 mg SO2/Nm3 or 0.01 - 0.10 kg SO2-S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of pulp. It can also be seen that firing high dry solids is an effective measure for low-sulphuric emissions from recovery boilers. Scrubbers are not needed to achieve these results. Normally some SO2 peaks are measured during the year (see Figure   3 .107).\n\nReported total gaseous S emissions (Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)-S + SO2-S) are shown in Figure   3 .106.\n\n\nFigure 3.106:\tGaseous S emissions from recovery boilers with the corresponding dry solids content (%) of black liquor, SO2 concentration and waste gas flow\n\n\nAn example for the daily average SO2 emissions data over a full year (dry gas, 273 K, 6 % O2) of a mill that runs the recovery boiler with a Dry Solids (DS) content of 75 % is shown in Figure   3 .107. The fuels are black liquor, and low-sulphur fuels (natural gas and light fuel oil) as a supporting fuel, and the weak malodorous gases. The data are taken from the on-line transfer of emission data to the competent authority (Source: Landesverwaltungsamt Halle, 2009, DE). SO2 is measured continuously. H2S emissions were below 1 mg/Nm3 during the whole year. The yearly average value of 3 mg/Nm3 in this existing example gives a yearly SO2 load of 0.03 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\nFigure 3.107:\tContinuously measured daily average data for SO2 emissions from a kraft pulp recovery boiler\n\n\nThe reported short-term SO2 and Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions are shown in Figure   3 .108 and Figure   3 .109.\n\n\nFigure 3.108:\tSO2 emissions from the recovery boiler as short-term average\n\nFigure 3.109:\tTotal Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the recovery boiler as short-term average\n\n\nCross-media effects\nIncreasing dry solids increases furnace temperatures and decreases sulphur emissions, but increases NOX emissions if no countermeasure is taken (see Section 3.3.17.2). Running recovery boilers with a high dry solids content and high furnace temperatures maximises the electricity production from the boilers (high pressures and temperatures).\n\nThe reduction of sulphur emissions by a high Dry Solids (DS) content increases the emissions of particulates prior to flue-gas cleaning. To compensate for this, a more efficient and expensive electrostatic precipitator has to be installed. At a very high Dry Solids (DS) content (>80 %) there is a considerable release of sulphur compounds from the last evaporator stage, which have to be collected and incinerated.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe process can be applied at both new and existing kraft mills. A superconcentrator can also be implemented as a separate phase to existing evaporation plants. Viscosity problems can be handled with pressurised storage or heat treatment before the last concentrator.\n\nEconomics\nIn existing mills the cost of improving the evaporation and concentration of strong black liquor is tied to the target concentration.

The sulphur content of Concentrated Non-condensable Gases (CNCG) and the fuel oil burnt in the recovery boiler are less significant for the reduction of SO2 emissions.\n\na) SO2 emissions \nSO2 emissions are formed mainly through the oxidation of H2S and carbonyl sulphide (COS) in the lower furnace. The major source of gaseous sulphur emissions is the black liquor (see Table   3 .52) and the sulphur content in additional fired streams such as Concentrated Non-condensable Gases (CNCG). The emission levels are kept low by operating the boiler with a high black liquor dry solids content (higher temperature) and by optimising the combustion parameters such as air supply and mixing of air and fuel. \n\nThe emission of sulphur from the recovery boiler is influenced by the operating variables given below.\n\nTemperature in the different zones which is influenced by the dry solids content (heating value) of the strong black liquor and the amount of combustion air. With higher Dry Solids (DS) feedstock, the combustion temperature increases and causes more sodium (Na) to be vaporised which then takes up the SO2 and forms Na2SO4, thus reducing SO2 emissions from the recovery boiler. On the other hand, the fact that more sulphur is driven off in the evaporation when the dry solids content of the black liquor is raised could reduce the sulphur reaching the recovery boiler if the sulphur-containing odorous gases from evaporation are not burnt in the recovery boiler. A drawback to the higher temperature is that emissions of NOX may increase.\nThe sulphur to sodium ratio (S/Na2) in the liquor (sulphidity). At higher sulphidity levels the release of sodium in the furnace in relation to the sulphur amount may not be sufficient to bind all the sulphur released and thus a share of the sulphur may leave the furnace as sulphur dioxide instead of sodium sulphate. The black liquor having a high dry solids contents may compensate this effect.\nExcess air supply, primary air temperature and distribution of combustion air. \nThe load on the furnace. Operating a recovery boiler in an overloaded mode has an adverse effect on the SO2 emissions characteristics. The load of the furnace is directly proportional to the temperature in the furnace, i.e. when the load of the furnace is changed, the temperature changes accordingly. In some boilers, the SO2 emissions are sensitive to changes in load, i.e. SO2 emissions may change due to the temperature changes in the furnace. SO2 emissions may also increase when the boiler load is reduced. SO2 emissions from other boilers (with very high Dry Solids (DS)) do not react to changes in the boiler load.\n\nAfter conventional evaporation, the Dry Solids (DS) content in the strong black liquor is about 70 %. By installing a concentrator in the evaporation plant, a Dry Solids (DS) content of 80 % or above (85 %) can be achieved. The achievable Dry Solids (DS) content depends partly on the wood species (see Section 3.1.11). \n\nb) Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions \nThe emission of total reduced sulphur (Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)) from the recovery boiler is influenced by almost the same operating variables as the SO2 emissions.\n\nDry solids content. Due to firing black liquor with a high dry solids content there is enough sodium in the flue-gases to bind almost all the sulphur formed in black liquor combustion. Sulphur emissions are very low or even undetectable in fully loaded and stably operated boilers. And if there is enough sodium to bind all the sulphur virtually no SO2 emissions are released.\nLoad on the furnace. The load of the furnace is directly proportional to the temperature in the furnace. Operating a recovery boiler in an overloaded mode may have an adverse effect on the emissions characteristics, especially on the quantity of hydrogen sulphide produced. Rapid changes in the operation mode may generate some momentary Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) peaks. Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from boilers with a very high dry solids content do not react to changes in the boiler load.\nAir distribution. The main controlling factor for the Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the recovery boiler furnace is the mixing of oxygen and sulphur-containing gases. If the gases are well mixed they are converted to SO2. Modern air systems help to achieve sufficient mixing.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of sulphur emissions and maximised electricity production.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWhen boilers burn black liquors with a high Dry Solids (DS) content (about 80 %), SO2 emissions are very low or even zero when the boiler is running in a steady state . The SO2 produced in the furnace reacts with sodium compounds to produce sodium sulphate. With high solids firing, there is enough sodium to bind all sulphur dioxide. However, there are normally still some peak emissions due to unstable operational conditions (see also Section 3.2.2.6.1).\n\nFigure   3 .104 and Figure   3 .105 show the annual average SO2 and Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) (some mills reported H2S only) emissions from recovery boilers fired with varying dry solids contents. For all mills that provided data, both the concentration values (mg/Nm3, 6 % O2) and emission loads (kg S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) are plotted. Dry solids contents below 73 %, between 73 % and 80 %, and above 80 % are indicated.\n\nFigure 3.104:\tSO2 emission concentrations and loads from recovery boilers with different dry solids contents (%) of black liquor and different softwood/hardwood use\n\n\nFigure 3.105:\tTotal Reduced Sulphur (TRS)-S emission concentrations and loads from recovery boilers with different dry solids contents (%) of black liquor and different softwood/hardwood use\n\n\nThe data confirm that Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the recovery boiler are very low or even zero when the boiler is running in a steady state. Normally, there are a number of peaks during the year. Most mills achieve emissions of <5 - 25 mg SO2/Nm3 or 0.01 - 0.10 kg SO2-S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of pulp. It can also be seen that firing high dry solids is an effective measure for low-sulphuric emissions from recovery boilers. Scrubbers are not needed to achieve these results. Normally some SO2 peaks are measured during the year (see Figure   3 .107).\n\nReported total gaseous S emissions (Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)-S + SO2-S) are shown in Figure   3 .106.\n\n\nFigure 3.106:\tGaseous S emissions from recovery boilers with the corresponding dry solids content (%) of black liquor, SO2 concentration and waste gas flow\n\n\nAn example for the daily average SO2 emissions data over a full year (dry gas, 273 K, 6 % O2) of a mill that runs the recovery boiler with a Dry Solids (DS) content of 75 % is shown in Figure   3 .107. The fuels are black liquor, and low-sulphur fuels (natural gas and light fuel oil) as a supporting fuel, and the weak malodorous gases. The data are taken from the on-line transfer of emission data to the competent authority (Source: Landesverwaltungsamt Halle, 2009, DE). SO2 is measured continuously. H2S emissions were below 1 mg/Nm3 during the whole year. The yearly average value of 3 mg/Nm3 in this existing example gives a yearly SO2 load of 0.03 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\nFigure 3.107:\tContinuously measured daily average data for SO2 emissions from a kraft pulp recovery boiler\n\n\nThe reported short-term SO2 and Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions are shown in Figure   3 .108 and Figure   3 .109.\n\n\nFigure 3.108:\tSO2 emissions from the recovery boiler as short-term average\n\nFigure 3.109:\tTotal Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the recovery boiler as short-term average\n\n\nCross-media effects\nIncreasing dry solids increases furnace temperatures and decreases sulphur emissions, but increases NOX emissions if no countermeasure is taken (see Section 3.3.17.2). Running recovery boilers with a high dry solids content and high furnace temperatures maximises the electricity production from the boilers (high pressures and temperatures).\n\nThe reduction of sulphur emissions by a high Dry Solids (DS) content increases the emissions of particulates prior to flue-gas cleaning. To compensate for this, a more efficient and expensive electrostatic precipitator has to be installed. At a very high Dry Solids (DS) content (>80 %) there is a considerable release of sulphur compounds from the last evaporator stage, which have to be collected and incinerated.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe process can be applied at both new and existing kraft mills. A superconcentrator can also be implemented as a separate phase to existing evaporation plants. Viscosity problems can be handled with pressurised storage or heat treatment before the last concentrator.\n\nEconomics\nIn existing mills the cost of improving the evaporation and concentration of strong black liquor is tied to the target concentration. At existing mills with 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d kraft pulp production, the investment required for increased black liquor concentration from 63 % upward is as follows:\n\nconcentration from 63 % to 70 %, EUR 1.7 - 2.0 million;\nconcentration from 63 % to 75 %, EUR 3.5 - 4.0 million;\nconcentration from 63 % to 80 %, EUR 8.0 - 9.0 million.\n\nIncreasing the dry solids content does not increase operating costs, and indeed significant savings are possible.

However, this energy is mainly lost with exhaust air and effluents to water. The low grade heat can be utilised to dry biofuel and sludge. The drying of biofuel and sludge can generate added revenue (or reduced purchase costs for energy) and thereby also create incentives for further energy-saving modifications to the main process.\n\nDue to the moisture content, in some mills additional fuels (such as oil) are added to combust bark in bark boilers. This is the case when the mechanical dewatering runs with lower performance levels. The drying of bark and sludge results in an added energy value, which makes it possible to combust the dried organic material without additional fuel.\n\nAn investigation of the available excess heat sources at the production site can determine the energy content in these heat sources and compare it to the energy needed for the drying process. A study analysing Swedish conditions  made the conclusions listed below.\n\nThere are large sources of excess heat available that could be used for drying purposes at pulp and paper mills.\nAt pulp and paper mills, investment in a biofuel dryer utilising excess heat should be profitable but will have to be economically evaluated case by case. In chemical pulp mills, the most profitable option is to use flue-gases from the recovery boiler as drying gas (assuming that no flue-gas condenser is installed). Other types of pulp and paper mills would have to use other available excess heat sources.\nBed drying seems to be the most suitable technology both from a technical and a commercial point of view.\n\nThe drying of biofuel and sludge is normally only economically viable if excess heat from other processes can be used for this purpose. Normally, excess heat such as hot air or hot process water flows can be used. Other more expensive options are steam heat exchangers or a gas-fired drying system. The minimum required temperature range is from 4 degC to 60 degC. \n\nTo run a dryer, hot air is produced with an air-to-air or water-to-air heat exchanger and is blown with fans into the dryer unit. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReducing the water content of bark, fibrous rejects, biosludge and other organic residues lowers the tonnage of waste to be transported for further treatment or disposal, which results in cost savings. Drying increases the calorific value of the biofuels and sludge and raises the thermal efficiency during combustion. The primary energy demand in the form of electricity and optional additional heating at load peaks is low when excess heat can be used for the drying process. The primary energy input to the drying process is essentially lower than the increased energy value of the fuel. Better energy and CO2 balance.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThere is still little experience with the drying of biofuels and sludge in the pulp and paper industry. Preventive maintenance of the machinery contributes to avoiding unnecessary and expensive shutdowns due to blocking or corrosion damage.\n\na) The UPM-Kymmene biofuel drying plant in Rauma achieves a dry content of the wet biofuel of 60 % after the drying process. The energy needed in the drying plant (belt dryer) comes from the excess heat of the paper mill (warm waste water and exhaust air). The installation reduces the use of fossil fuels and increases the share of biofuels by 10 %.\n\nIn the case of the large Rauma mill, CO2 emissions are reduced by 70 000 tonnes per year.\n\nb) The Norske Skog Follum mill dries the secondary (biological) sludge in order to make incineration possible. The net effect on energy is slightly negative and some biofuel is purchased to supply heat for drying. Bark is only pressed. 43 % dryness is reached by using leading bark press technology. Drying of waste biofuels contributes positively to the energy balance only through usage of excess heat.\n\nThe secondary sludge could alternatively be used as soil fertiliser, if the level of impurities is maintained at an acceptable level. \n\nIn specific applications (e.g. the use of fibrous sludge in the cement and brick industry) and for a better handling of the dried sludge, a minimum humidity content may be required.\n\nCross-media effects\nIf excess heat can be used for drying, the energy balance of the process is positive. The extracted humidity may cause an odour problem and needs to be controlled.\n\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nThe measure can generally be applied to both new and existing plants that have suitable excess heat sources for the drying of the biomass and sludge. \n\nIn particular, drying is applicable when combustion for energy production is the final use for these by-products and when the drying process cost (mainly investment and fuel) is lower than the benefits of increased energy production.\n\nIn southern Europe, during the dry season, biofuel (bark and wooden biomass; not the biosludge) arrives at the mill with a water content that allows energy production at the desired flame temperature for almost all year, which may affect the economic viability of the measure.\n\nThe use of secondary heat for drying may face the following restrictions:\n\nThe investment costs of this solution increase with the use of low-temperature excess heat as a consequence of the need for larger dryers.\nThe use of high-temperature excess heat, usually flue-gas, is associated with the problem of achieving the acid dew point of the gas with consequence of extended corrosion or increased cost. This can be prevented either by the choice of construction materials or by reducing the recovery temperature range.\nThe implementation of this solution is also dependent on the layout of the mill, namely the distance between the secondary heat sources and the places where the sludges and biofuels are generated.\nDrying and burning of biomass and waste water treatment sludge is just one of the possible waste management options. Alternative usages of waste water sludge are available that also recover the value of this material.\n\nEconomics\nNo cost data submitted. \n\nThe economic feasibility depends on the technical characteristics of the mill, or climate in the case of use of heat from the environment. When assessing the costs, the savings for reduced weight transport have to be taken into account. Generally, the economic benefits will also depend on the regulations on the use of biofuels for energy generation.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nDrying of sludge and bark is done in some mills, basically for two reasons: to increase the calorific value prior to incineration or to ease the handling (reduce weight for lower transport and landfill costs).\n\nExample plants\nUPM-Kymmene, Rauma (FI), Norske Skog, Follum (Nitric Oxide (NO)).\n\nReference literature\n.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2918553_abstract", "x": 0.6801468, "y": 0.39098868, "title": "KINETIC ENERGY DRYING DEVICE AND DRYING METHOD FOR SLUDGE", "year": 2015, "text": "A kinetic energy drying device for sludge comprises a shell (3) provided with a first rotating shaft (8), which is fixedly connected with a rotating disk (7), on the bottom; a steel knife (9) fixed on the rotating disk (7) along the circumferential direction, and a stainless steel wave plate (5) provided on the top of the first rotating shaft (8).

The complexing agents are used in neutral, slightly acidic or slightly alkaline (depending on the formulation and the process requirements) washing and pulp bleaching steps to eliminate transition metals (mainly Mn and Fe, and Cu). The most widely used chelating agents are EDTA (initialism for the chemical compound ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and DTPA, a polyamino carboxylic acid, in different product formulations.\n\nDTPA and EDTA are powerful chelants, but are poorly biodegradable and are emitted to receiving water bodies at the end of the process. Even though EDTA and DTPA are considered stable molecules, some studies suggest that they are degraded substantially in the harsh conditions of bleaching . The bleaching agents ozone, chlorine dioxide and peracetic acid may degrade to a certain extent both EDTA and DTPA that are introduced into the bleaching of chemical pulp. Others observed a significant reduction of EDTA in biological waste water treatment plants under slightly alkaline conditions (pH between 7 and 8) . This removal is either the result of degradation or transformation of EDTA into unknown degradation products. By contrast, other studies  and mill operators found that the used EDTA can be almost completely detected in the effluents of their biological waste water treatment (less than 10 % biodegradation). DTPA is more degradable than EDTA in an aquatic environment, but it is probable that DTPA decomposes to EDTA during the bleaching process or in the waste water treatment. \n[ Sillanpaa M, 1997 ], [ Remberger M, 2001 ].\n\nThe following stepwise approach can be implemented in order to reduce the emissions from the use of chelating agents efficiently: \n\n1. Carrying out a simplified 'mass balance' that provides information about the fate of complexing agents in the process and the biological waste water treatment plant (use, retention or degradation in bleaching and washing steps, elimination or degradation during waste water treatment). Thus, the quantity of chelates that is released to the environment is determined. From an environmental point of view, the quality and bonding form of the discharged complexes may be distinguished.\n\n2. Periodic measurements by qualified/certified laboratories and documentation of the chelating agents in the effluents.\n\n3. Investigation and documentation of the possibilities for: \n(i) \treducing the use of not readily biodegradable chelating agents in the process by for example optimising pH, dosing and retention time, recovery and retention of the chelating agents in the process);\n(ii) \trecovery and retention of the chemicals in the process;\n(iii) \ttheir reduction in the waste water treatment system (an extension of residence times, e.g. sludge age > 28 d and a slightly alkaline pH seem to enhance the biodegradation of chelating agents in some waste water treatment plants). This also includes the follow-up of the development of biodegradable or eliminable substitutes that match bleaching requirements.\n\n4. Preferential usage of biodegradable or eliminable products and phasing out of non-biodegradable products as much as possible taking into account their technical and economic suitability and viability. Alternative chelating agents should reach biodegradation levels of above 70 - 80 % according to the biodegradation test standard EN ISO 7827 or similar methods. \n\nA stepwise introduction of these new chemical additives is normally most promising. To achieve the effectiveness of new complexing agents, they need to be first tested, the correct formulations determined and the operational conditions of the bleaching process adapted (pH, temperatures, other chemicals used, dosing points).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThis technique should result in a reduction in emissions of the poorly biodegradable EDTA/DTPA by reducing their use. This should reduce the concentration of chelating agents in river waters downstream of mills. EDTA/DTPA have the ability to remobilise heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) from natural water sediments, which may accumulate in water bodies or reach the drinking water supply via waste water input. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe use of chelating agents is only relevant for peroxide-based bleaching technologies. The quantity of chelating agents needed depends on a number of factors: the quality and heavy metal content of the wood logs/chips used, the final brightness to be achieved, and for chemical pulp mills: the quality of the base used (impurities). There are significant differences with regard to the heavy metal content of the wood and the cooking base used (in the case of sulphite pulping, the make-up magnesium oxide). Mills that use wood with higher alkaline earth metal content have failed to reach the desired qualities of the pulp after bleaching without using DTPA or EDTA. A few others could operate the peroxide bleaching stages without using a chelating agent. Also, the seasons may have an influence on the need for chelating agents in bleaching. In the summer, stored wood achieves less brightness with the same treatment. And wood that is stored over longer time periods loses brightness.\n\nSome new complexing agents reach biodegradation levels above 70 % or 80 % according to the biodegradation test standard EN ISO 7827 . Some chemical suppliers report that biodegradable chelant systems have been developed that match the performance of the traditional chelants in the chemical pulping processes. For example, the sodium salt of iminodi-succinic acid (IDS) is a readily biodegradable chelating agent \n. The biodegradability of N-bis-dicarboxyethoxy-ethyl aspartic acid (AES) is reported to be 20 - 70 %, depending on the sludge used \n. This novel complexing agent (AES) is not readily biodegradable but shows slight biodegradation.\n\nThe following substances were positively tested, i.e. meet 80 % biodegradability, by Holzforschung Austria. With regard to functionality, the substances shown in Table   2 .37 nearly meet the performance of EDTA/DTPA, but in some cases not completely.\n\n\nTable 2.37:\tBiodegradable chelating agents with nearly full functionality\n\n\nIt is difficult to assess the effectiveness of biodegradable chelating agents in full-scale trials as most of the results are treated confidentially. Research institutes like Holzforschung Austria report that in full-scale trials there is no clear evidence yet that the alternative bleaching additives match the performance of the traditional chelants. The results obtained with the most promising products do not yet completely equal the technological performance of DTPA or EDTA. This is especially worth remembering when the highest brightness levels have to be achieved (where a brightness loss of 1 percentage point is already unacceptable for the mills). Therefore, research is continuing with modifications of complexing agents and variations of usage . By contrast, others report that full-scale mill trial results and experience from regular customers show that biodegradable chelating agents may replace DTPA/EDTA without the loss of process efficiency .\n\nDistinguishing between the major pulp grades, some operational experience regarding reduced emissions of chelating agents are summarised below.\n\nKraft pulping:\nThere are cases where the biological waste water treatment (see Section 3.3.13) leads to a reduction of approximately 90 % of the EDTA . For example, at the Stendal pulp mill, DE, the inflow concentration of 34 - 63 mg EDTA/l is reduced to effluent concentrations between 0.4 and 7 mg EDTA/l (average 2008: 1.8 mg/l; measured 12 times a year in 24-hour composite samples; method of analysis: DIN 38413-3). In the inflow on average 50 mg EDTA/l (24-hour mixed sample) was measured \n.\n\nNo further evidence from real mills has been provided, be they a single case or at other kraft pulp mills.\n\nSulphite pulping:\nIn nearly all mills in the bleach plant, DTPA is used (1 - 2 kg DTPA/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). Depending on the closure of the bleach plant 10 - 90 % of this ends up in the waste water. Normally, no significant biodegradation of DTPA in the waste water treatment plant can be expected. So, pulp mills that do not possess a MgO-based first bleaching step that allows parts of the washing liquids to be recirculated back to the recovery island (see Section 4.3.8) will virtually release 90 - 100 % of the used DTPA or 1 - 2 kg DTPA/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\nA German pulp mill with the bleaching sequence PMgO-A-PNaOH recirculates 80 - 90 % of the used DTPA to the chemical recovery plant and thus prevents the release of DTPA to the water body in an effective way. Manufacturing 500 - 600 tonnes of pulp/day, the mill uses around 1 000 kg DTPA/day, of which only 50 - 60 kg DTPA/day are actually released to the environment.\n\nThe effectiveness of the substitutes for EDTA or DTPA seems to depend on a number of factors such as the type of pulping and bleaching, the wood species used and their metal content, the alkaline earth and heavy metal content (impurities) of the bleaching base (e.g. make-up MgO for sulphite pulp mills) and the final objectives for brightness or dirt spots. One German pulp mill uses a mixture of DTPA and DTMPA, a phosphonate that is also not readily biodegradable but more adsorbable to the biosludge. As DTMPA accumulates on the biomass of the waste water treatment plant, it can be eliminated from the waste water and less chelating agents are released to the water body .\n\nThe sulphite pulp mill Nordic Paper, SE, uses 0.7 - 1.0 kg EDTA/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), the majority of which ends up in the waste water treatment plant. By using a three-step bioreactor process with Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology 40 % degradation of EDTA is observed.\n\nGroundwood\nSeveral mill trials from Holzforschung Austria in oxidative bleaching of groundwood pulp have clearly shown that an elimination of DTPA leads to a brightness drop of \n5 - 6 points in ISO brightness. Trials with the substitution of DTPA for other chemicals (sold by the suppliers as biodegradable) have shown that a reduction (e.g. from 0.3 % to 0.05 %) of DTPA is possible though with brightness losses of 1 - 2 points. Phosphonate-based substitutes showed results similar to DTPA in some cases. If the alternative contains phosphonates, it may create operational problems in the clarification plant. There are mills that have not observed these problems while applying phosphonates as eliminable alternative chelating agents achieving complexing properties close to DTPA \n. A pulp and paper mill in Germany has considerably reduced the amount of DTPA used in its groundwood line from 2 kg DTPA/t down to 0.4 kg DTPA/tonne of pulp (source: German EPA, 2010).\n\n\nDeinked pulp from processing paper for recycling \nIn most cases, chelating agents are not required to produce bleached deinked grades based on paper for recycling. The stabilisation of the peroxide required for oxidative bleaching occurs mainly through natural or modified types of sodium silicate (Na/K silicates). Due to the high calcium content in the process waters, the effect of EDTA or DTPA is greatly reduced so their use is normally not effective. As an exception, DTPA is used as a chelating agent in the production of very high-quality paper such as SC-B-qualities based on 100 % deinked pulp (DIP) or SC-A-quality with 25 % DIP use (example mill in Germany). An additional washing stage is established before the peroxide stage. The DTPA amounts used in these cases are comparatively small. \n\nCross-media effects\nIf biodegradable complexing agents are used, no negative cross-media effects are to be expected (as long as the alternatives match the performance of the traditional chelants).\n\nWhen the major feature of the substitutes is the better adsorption capacity (e.g. some phosphonates), the metal complexes are not biologically degraded. However, they are not released with the discharged waste water but adsorbed into the bleached fibres or the biosludge, which is burnt in most cases.\n\nStudies that were carried out at Holzforschung Austria (HFA) on the elimination of phosphonates (tests according to EN ISO 7827) showed that the phosphonates are not biodegradable; they also showed that phosphonates do not adsorb to biosludge to the extent communicated elsewhere; and that they are only detectable with great effort and may increase the phosphorus content of the waste water.\n\nHowever, for a full-scale application of phosphonate-based chelating agents e.g. in the paper mill Albbruck (DE), a removal rate of approximately 90 % of the phosphonates after passing the biological treatment plant has been shown .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe stepwise approach for reducing the emissions from the use of chelating agents is applicable to new and existing mills. Depending on the substitutes used, minor or more significant process adjustments may be required to guarantee the performance of the complexing agents. For example, some adjustment to the process usually in terms of altering the pH or dosing point of the chelant has been found to be necessary to optimise the process for the new blend.\n\nOften the biodegradable alternatives to EDTA/DTPA are highly specific, i.e. different chelating agents have to be used for different pulping and bleaching processes. There is no one-size-fits-all chelating agent like EDTA/DTPA. Before application, there is a need for process adjustments and for the identification of the most appropriate bleaching additive substances.\n\nEconomics\nThe mass balance of the use and fate of the chelating agents used (EDTA or DTPA) involves calculating costs for the sampling, chemical analysis and the drafting of a report. If more biodegradable substitutes are investigated on a full scale, normally chemical suppliers take care of sampling, analysis, etc. in the test phase, i.e. it should not cause any extra costs for the pulp mill. The economics of the mass balance calculation and tests of conventional products or substitutes does not differ as the same procedure is needed for both products.\n\nWhen an operator decides to use a more readily biodegradable substitute, a dosage pump and pipes are needed. However, when the biodegradable chelating agents are used on a regular basis, the mill uses the same dosing pumps/tanks and pipes as with DTPA/EDTA, so no extra costs should occur. It is unlikely that significant modifications to the plant will be required, so there is very little investment required for the substitution of the bleaching additives.\n\nThe main cost implication is in the price of the biodegradable alternative chelant. The unit price per 100 % active ingredient was in 2010 higher for biodegradable or eliminable substitutes than for DTPA or EDTA. One chemical supplier reported that the unit prices of biodegradable substitutes are ~10 - 15 % higher than the unit price of DTPA. In contrast, a paper mill (SCA Laakirchen, AT) reported that the bleaching costs would rise considerably (up to 200 %) if a tested alternative chelating agent was used exclusively .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe Commission Recommendation on risk measures for substances such as EDTA \n proposes in its Section 6 a number of measures for the reduction of EDTA emissions, which are also applicable to other poorly biodegradable chelants like DTPA:\n\nto establish Environmental Quality Standards (Environmental Quality Standards (EQS)) and national pollution reduction measures; \nto consider the usage of EDTA in permits issued under Directive 2010/75/EU; \nto monitor the implementation of Best Available Techniques (BAT) regarding EDTA and report any important developments to the Commission in the framework of the exchange of information on Best Available Techniques (BAT).\n\nAlso, in the Commission Communication on the results of the risk evaluation and \nthe risk reduction strategies for different substances, one of which is EDTA \n, it is recommended that the updated BREF develop guidance on Best Available Techniques (BAT) in terms of EDTA use. Directive 2008/105/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2008 on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy  (Daughter Directive to Article 16 of the EU Water Framework Directive) also includes EDTA in its Annex III, 'Substances subject to review for possible identification as priority substances or priority hazardous substances'.\n\nSome national regulations and regional competent authorities ask pulp mills within the area of their responsibility to reduce emissions of EDTA or DTPA to the receiving waters (e.g. in Austria or Germany), assessing the availability of substitutes case by case. If recipient rivers or lakes are used to provide drinking water, environmental officials set increasingly strict limits on permissible EDTA and DTPA concentrations.\n\nExample plants\nA few sulphite pulp mills use no chelating agents for metal management, although most of them do. Others are seeking to reduce the release of chelating agents from the mill to receiving water bodies. According to confidential information, a mechanical pulp mill in Central Europe has used a biodegradable chelating agent in their process successfully since January 2009. A RCF mill in Central Europe uses a biodegradable chelating agent regularly.\n\nDue to the confidentiality of the full-scale experiences, it is not possible to present more detailed information.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n, , , \n, , , \n, , \n, , \n.\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3156470_abstract", "x": 0.5761762, "y": 0.24940692, "title": "SUBSTANCE FOR COLLECTING PETROLEUM OR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM SURFACE OF WATER AND UTILIZATION METHOD THEREOF (VARIANTS)", "year": 2017, "text": "This group of inventions relates to organic chemistry and can be used for skimming films of petrol, oils, black oil, fuels, hydrocarbons and other petroleum products, aiming at cleaning the surface of water and also at cleaning natural water flows polluted with oil or oil products.

Others observed a significant reduction of EDTA in biological waste water treatment plants under slightly alkaline conditions (pH between 7 and 8) . This removal is either the result of degradation or transformation of EDTA into unknown degradation products. By contrast, other studies  and mill operators found that the used EDTA can be almost completely detected in the effluents of their biological waste water treatment (less than 10 % biodegradation). DTPA is more degradable than EDTA in an aquatic environment, but it is probable that DTPA decomposes to EDTA during the bleaching process or in the waste water treatment. \n[ Sillanpaa M, 1997 ], [ Remberger M, 2001 ].\n\nThe following stepwise approach can be implemented in order to reduce the emissions from the use of chelating agents efficiently: \n\n1. Carrying out a simplified 'mass balance' that provides information about the fate of complexing agents in the process and the biological waste water treatment plant (use, retention or degradation in bleaching and washing steps, elimination or degradation during waste water treatment). Thus, the quantity of chelates that is released to the environment is determined. From an environmental point of view, the quality and bonding form of the discharged complexes may be distinguished.\n\n2. Periodic measurements by qualified/certified laboratories and documentation of the chelating agents in the effluents.\n\n3. Investigation and documentation of the possibilities for: \n(i) \treducing the use of not readily biodegradable chelating agents in the process by for example optimising pH, dosing and retention time, recovery and retention of the chelating agents in the process);\n(ii) \trecovery and retention of the chemicals in the process;\n(iii) \ttheir reduction in the waste water treatment system (an extension of residence times, e.g. sludge age > 28 d and a slightly alkaline pH seem to enhance the biodegradation of chelating agents in some waste water treatment plants). This also includes the follow-up of the development of biodegradable or eliminable substitutes that match bleaching requirements.\n\n4. Preferential usage of biodegradable or eliminable products and phasing out of non-biodegradable products as much as possible taking into account their technical and economic suitability and viability. Alternative chelating agents should reach biodegradation levels of above 70 - 80 % according to the biodegradation test standard EN ISO 7827 or similar methods. \n\nA stepwise introduction of these new chemical additives is normally most promising. To achieve the effectiveness of new complexing agents, they need to be first tested, the correct formulations determined and the operational conditions of the bleaching process adapted (pH, temperatures, other chemicals used, dosing points).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThis technique should result in a reduction in emissions of the poorly biodegradable EDTA/DTPA by reducing their use. This should reduce the concentration of chelating agents in river waters downstream of mills. EDTA/DTPA have the ability to remobilise heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) from natural water sediments, which may accumulate in water bodies or reach the drinking water supply via waste water input. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe use of chelating agents is only relevant for peroxide-based bleaching technologies. The quantity of chelating agents needed depends on a number of factors: the quality and heavy metal content of the wood logs/chips used, the final brightness to be achieved, and for chemical pulp mills: the quality of the base used (impurities). There are significant differences with regard to the heavy metal content of the wood and the cooking base used (in the case of sulphite pulping, the make-up magnesium oxide). Mills that use wood with higher alkaline earth metal content have failed to reach the desired qualities of the pulp after bleaching without using DTPA or EDTA. A few others could operate the peroxide bleaching stages without using a chelating agent. Also, the seasons may have an influence on the need for chelating agents in bleaching. In the summer, stored wood achieves less brightness with the same treatment. And wood that is stored over longer time periods loses brightness.\n\nSome new complexing agents reach biodegradation levels above 70 % or 80 % according to the biodegradation test standard EN ISO 7827 . Some chemical suppliers report that biodegradable chelant systems have been developed that match the performance of the traditional chelants in the chemical pulping processes. For example, the sodium salt of iminodi-succinic acid (IDS) is a readily biodegradable chelating agent \n. The biodegradability of N-bis-dicarboxyethoxy-ethyl aspartic acid (AES) is reported to be 20 - 70 %, depending on the sludge used \n. This novel complexing agent (AES) is not readily biodegradable but shows slight biodegradation.\n\nThe following substances were positively tested, i.e. meet 80 % biodegradability, by Holzforschung Austria. With regard to functionality, the substances shown in Table   2 .37 nearly meet the performance of EDTA/DTPA, but in some cases not completely.\n\n\nTable 2.37:\tBiodegradable chelating agents with nearly full functionality\n\n\nIt is difficult to assess the effectiveness of biodegradable chelating agents in full-scale trials as most of the results are treated confidentially. Research institutes like Holzforschung Austria report that in full-scale trials there is no clear evidence yet that the alternative bleaching additives match the performance of the traditional chelants. The results obtained with the most promising products do not yet completely equal the technological performance of DTPA or EDTA. This is especially worth remembering when the highest brightness levels have to be achieved (where a brightness loss of 1 percentage point is already unacceptable for the mills). Therefore, research is continuing with modifications of complexing agents and variations of usage . By contrast, others report that full-scale mill trial results and experience from regular customers show that biodegradable chelating agents may replace DTPA/EDTA without the loss of process efficiency .\n\nDistinguishing between the major pulp grades, some operational experience regarding reduced emissions of chelating agents are summarised below.\n\nKraft pulping:\nThere are cases where the biological waste water treatment (see Section 3.3.13) leads to a reduction of approximately 90 % of the EDTA . For example, at the Stendal pulp mill, DE, the inflow concentration of 34 - 63 mg EDTA/l is reduced to effluent concentrations between 0.4 and 7 mg EDTA/l (average 2008: 1.8 mg/l; measured 12 times a year in 24-hour composite samples; method of analysis: DIN 38413-3). In the inflow on average 50 mg EDTA/l (24-hour mixed sample) was measured \n.\n\nNo further evidence from real mills has been provided, be they a single case or at other kraft pulp mills.\n\nSulphite pulping:\nIn nearly all mills in the bleach plant, DTPA is used (1 - 2 kg DTPA/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). Depending on the closure of the bleach plant 10 - 90 % of this ends up in the waste water. Normally, no significant biodegradation of DTPA in the waste water treatment plant can be expected. So, pulp mills that do not possess a MgO-based first bleaching step that allows parts of the washing liquids to be recirculated back to the recovery island (see Section 4.3.8) will virtually release 90 - 100 % of the used DTPA or 1 - 2 kg DTPA/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\nA German pulp mill with the bleaching sequence PMgO-A-PNaOH recirculates 80 - 90 % of the used DTPA to the chemical recovery plant and thus prevents the release of DTPA to the water body in an effective way. Manufacturing 500 - 600 tonnes of pulp/day, the mill uses around 1 000 kg DTPA/day, of which only 50 - 60 kg DTPA/day are actually released to the environment.\n\nThe effectiveness of the substitutes for EDTA or DTPA seems to depend on a number of factors such as the type of pulping and bleaching, the wood species used and their metal content, the alkaline earth and heavy metal content (impurities) of the bleaching base (e.g. make-up MgO for sulphite pulp mills) and the final objectives for brightness or dirt spots. One German pulp mill uses a mixture of DTPA and DTMPA, a phosphonate that is also not readily biodegradable but more adsorbable to the biosludge. As DTMPA accumulates on the biomass of the waste water treatment plant, it can be eliminated from the waste water and less chelating agents are released to the water body .\n\nThe sulphite pulp mill Nordic Paper, SE, uses 0.7 - 1.0 kg EDTA/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), the majority of which ends up in the waste water treatment plant. By using a three-step bioreactor process with Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR) technology 40 % degradation of EDTA is observed.\n\nGroundwood\nSeveral mill trials from Holzforschung Austria in oxidative bleaching of groundwood pulp have clearly shown that an elimination of DTPA leads to a brightness drop of \n5 - 6 points in ISO brightness. Trials with the substitution of DTPA for other chemicals (sold by the suppliers as biodegradable) have shown that a reduction (e.g. from 0.3 % to 0.05 %) of DTPA is possible though with brightness losses of 1 - 2 points. Phosphonate-based substitutes showed results similar to DTPA in some cases. If the alternative contains phosphonates, it may create operational problems in the clarification plant. There are mills that have not observed these problems while applying phosphonates as eliminable alternative chelating agents achieving complexing properties close to DTPA \n. A pulp and paper mill in Germany has considerably reduced the amount of DTPA used in its groundwood line from 2 kg DTPA/t down to 0.4 kg DTPA/tonne of pulp (source: German EPA, 2010).\n\n\nDeinked pulp from processing paper for recycling \nIn most cases, chelating agents are not required to produce bleached deinked grades based on paper for recycling. The stabilisation of the peroxide required for oxidative bleaching occurs mainly through natural or modified types of sodium silicate (Na/K silicates). Due to the high calcium content in the process waters, the effect of EDTA or DTPA is greatly reduced so their use is normally not effective. As an exception, DTPA is used as a chelating agent in the production of very high-quality paper such as SC-B-qualities based on 100 % deinked pulp (DIP) or SC-A-quality with 25 % DIP use (example mill in Germany). An additional washing stage is established before the peroxide stage. The DTPA amounts used in these cases are comparatively small. \n\nCross-media effects\nIf biodegradable complexing agents are used, no negative cross-media effects are to be expected (as long as the alternatives match the performance of the traditional chelants).\n\nWhen the major feature of the substitutes is the better adsorption capacity (e.g. some phosphonates), the metal complexes are not biologically degraded. However, they are not released with the discharged waste water but adsorbed into the bleached fibres or the biosludge, which is burnt in most cases.\n\nStudies that were carried out at Holzforschung Austria (HFA) on the elimination of phosphonates (tests according to EN ISO 7827) showed that the phosphonates are not biodegradable; they also showed that phosphonates do not adsorb to biosludge to the extent communicated elsewhere; and that they are only detectable with great effort and may increase the phosphorus content of the waste water.\n\nHowever, for a full-scale application of phosphonate-based chelating agents e.g. in the paper mill Albbruck (DE), a removal rate of approximately 90 % of the phosphonates after passing the biological treatment plant has been shown .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe stepwise approach for reducing the emissions from the use of chelating agents is applicable to new and existing mills. Depending on the substitutes used, minor or more significant process adjustments may be required to guarantee the performance of the complexing agents. For example, some adjustment to the process usually in terms of altering the pH or dosing point of the chelant has been found to be necessary to optimise the process for the new blend.\n\nOften the biodegradable alternatives to EDTA/DTPA are highly specific, i.e. different chelating agents have to be used for different pulping and bleaching processes. There is no one-size-fits-all chelating agent like EDTA/DTPA. Before application, there is a need for process adjustments and for the identification of the most appropriate bleaching additive substances.\n\nEconomics\nThe mass balance of the use and fate of the chelating agents used (EDTA or DTPA) involves calculating costs for the sampling, chemical analysis and the drafting of a report. If more biodegradable substitutes are investigated on a full scale, normally chemical suppliers take care of sampling, analysis, etc. in the test phase, i.e. it should not cause any extra costs for the pulp mill. The economics of the mass balance calculation and tests of conventional products or substitutes does not differ as the same procedure is needed for both products.\n\nWhen an operator decides to use a more readily biodegradable substitute, a dosage pump and pipes are needed. However, when the biodegradable chelating agents are used on a regular basis, the mill uses the same dosing pumps/tanks and pipes as with DTPA/EDTA, so no extra costs should occur. It is unlikely that significant modifications to the plant will be required, so there is very little investment required for the substitution of the bleaching additives.\n\nThe main cost implication is in the price of the biodegradable alternative chelant. The unit price per 100 % active ingredient was in 2010 higher for biodegradable or eliminable substitutes than for DTPA or EDTA. One chemical supplier reported that the unit prices of biodegradable substitutes are ~10 - 15 % higher than the unit price of DTPA. In contrast, a paper mill (SCA Laakirchen, AT) reported that the bleaching costs would rise considerably (up to 200 %) if a tested alternative chelating agent was used exclusively .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe Commission Recommendation on risk measures for substances such as EDTA \n proposes in its Section 6 a number of measures for the reduction of EDTA emissions, which are also applicable to other poorly biodegradable chelants like DTPA:\n\nto establish Environmental Quality Standards (Environmental Quality Standards (EQS)) and national pollution reduction measures; \nto consider the usage of EDTA in permits issued under Directive 2010/75/EU; \nto monitor the implementation of Best Available Techniques (BAT) regarding EDTA and report any important developments to the Commission in the framework of the exchange of information on Best Available Techniques (BAT).\n\nAlso, in the Commission Communication on the results of the risk evaluation and \nthe risk reduction strategies for different substances, one of which is EDTA \n, it is recommended that the updated BREF develop guidance on Best Available Techniques (BAT) in terms of EDTA use. Directive 2008/105/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2008 on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy  (Daughter Directive to Article 16 of the EU Water Framework Directive) also includes EDTA in its Annex III, 'Substances subject to review for possible identification as priority substances or priority hazardous substances'.\n\nSome national regulations and regional competent authorities ask pulp mills within the area of their responsibility to reduce emissions of EDTA or DTPA to the receiving waters (e.g. in Austria or Germany), assessing the availability of substitutes case by case. If recipient rivers or lakes are used to provide drinking water, environmental officials set increasingly strict limits on permissible EDTA and DTPA concentrations.\n\nExample plants\nA few sulphite pulp mills use no chelating agents for metal management, although most of them do. Others are seeking to reduce the release of chelating agents from the mill to receiving water bodies. According to confidential information, a mechanical pulp mill in Central Europe has used a biodegradable chelating agent in their process successfully since January 2009. A RCF mill in Central Europe uses a biodegradable chelating agent regularly.\n\nDue to the confidentiality of the full-scale experiences, it is not possible to present more detailed information.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n, , , \n, , , \n, , \n, , \n.\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3925445_abstract", "x": 0.59859234, "y": 0.31584144, "title": "METHOD FOR TREATING WATER SYSTEMS", "year": 2021, "text": "A composition for treating a water system or membrane fluid system, such as a reverse osmosis system, to remove scale, microorganisms and biofilm, and corrosion by-products.

Preferably the two-stage process is used. Some mills apply pure oxygen in a first stage, followed by a 'normal' aerated second stage. Some mills use a high-loaded first stage followed by a lower-loaded second aeration tank. Moving bed biofilm reactors are also used for this type of waste water. One mill has reported a biofiltration stage after a two-stage activated sludge system. In principle, effluent from mechanical pulp mills can also be treated efficiently anaerobically because the concentrations in waste water are often above 2 000 mg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/l. However, in most cases, pulp and paper mill effluents are treated with aerobic methods, with the exception of CTMP mills or other concentrated effluent streams for which anaerobic treatment has sometimes been applied (see Section 5.3.8).\n\nThe efficiency of the treatment plants vary to a certain extent depending on the type of effluents treated and the design, operation, maintenance and control of the treatment plant. Typical values are within the ranges of 95 - 98 % for BOD removal (normally 95+ %) and 80 - 90 % for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal. At well designed and operated plants, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) emissions are between 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l and BOD between 5 mg/l and 15 mg/l (close to the detection limit) both as an annual average value (see Table   5 .127).\n\nTable   5 .127 compiles the achieved emission levels to water after biological treatment of a selection of well performing mechanical pulp and paper mills in Europe and demonstrates the different treatment concepts realised. The mills operate with different process conditions and water system configurations. Where data were available, the fibre mix used, the pulping or bleaching techniques, the products manufactured (e.g. % ISO brightness to be achieved) and the waste water treatment system applied are indicated. Example paper mills include newsprint, printing paper and board mills.\n\nThese mills have implemented internal water management and apply an effective biological treatment. The treatment efficiency of these examples is >80 - 90 % for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). The biological treatment plants are designed and operated mostly as low-loaded activated sludge plants or comparable systems such as moving bed biofilm reactors sometimes followed by an activated sludge stage. The list of mills is a selection of mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. The method of analysis is the one used in the respective country but mostly standard methods are applied. In Sweden and Finland the values for BOD are given as BOD7. All values are yearly average values. Figures in Table   5 .127 given within brackets are concentration values (mg/l). A few mills measure total organic carbon (Total Organic Carbon (TOC)) as a substitute for the parameter Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or in addition to it. Where available, these Total Organic Carbon (TOC) values are presented in the table in square brackets. \nTable 5.127:\tAnnual average of emissions to water after biological treatment of mechanical pulp mills in Europe\n\nMagazine paper production based upon intensively peroxide bleached TMP with a low degree of kraft pulp blend (e.g. some Light-weight Coated (LWC) paper mills) has an effect on the final discharge of organic substances (measured as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)) for TMP. Increased market demands for brightness and new enhanced paper products will create a higher lignin-based Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load to the waste water treatment plant. Despite high efficiency waste water treatment plants, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load after treatment may reach 5 - 6 kg/t in a few cases. In the case of highly bleached mechanical pulp (70 - 100 % of fibre in final paper), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) levels of up to 8 kg/t may occur.\n\nCross-media effects\nAerobic biological waste water treatment consumes energy (e.g. for aerators and pumps) and generates sludge that normally requires treatment before utilisation or disposal.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nThe process can be applied at both new and existing mechanical pulp (and paper) mills. \n\nAerobic waste water treatment plants have been used for many years in all types of mechanical pulp and paper mills with good results.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for a completely new activated sludge treatment plant is approximately EUR 10 - 12 million for a new 700 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d integrated mechanical pulp mill. These costs also include the necessary primary treatment and sludge handling. The corresponding operating costs are EUR 0.9 - 1.2 million/year.\n\nIn existing mills, measures to reduce water flow should preferably be carried out before building a new waste water treatment plant in order to reduce the investment costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe activated sludge process is preferably used when high or very high treatment efficiencies are required. \n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants all over the world for all types of effluents.\n\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3231924_abstract", "x": 0.66811943, "y": 0.39433968, "title": "MULTI-DRUM WASHING MACHINE DRAINAGE CONTROL METHOD", "year": 2017, "text": "A multi-drum washing machine drainage control method, the multi-drum washing machine at least comprising a first washing drum (1) and a second washing drum (2); the method comprising: when the first washing drum (1) reaches a drainage process, determining whether the second washing drum (2) is draining; if yes, then the first washing drum (1) waits for the second washing drum (2) to finish draining before starting to drain; and if not, then determining whether the first washing drum (1) waits for the second washing drum (2) to finish draining before starting to drain.

These substances are converted by different variants of biological treatment systems into biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Low-loaded aerobic activated sludge systems are widely used in the sector. The nutrient content in waste water of paper for recycling mills is generally low. \n\nExample MBR at Kohler Pappen, Gengenbach (DE)\nThe mill manufactures 35 000 tonnes/year of paper for recycling-based cartonboard (grey board) on three paper machines. Many different grades are produced, some of which are coloured. Before implementing the MBR, the waste water was purified by sedimentation only and was then sent to a common municipal biological treatment plant. The average product-specific amount of waste water is approximately 8 m3/t or 38 m3/day.\n\nThe municipality decided to drastically increase the waste water fees from EUR 0.35/m3 up to EUR 2.05/m3. The mill also has to pay for the fresh water ('water cent'). Fresh water reduction and waste water volume reduction were therefore a necessity. Furthermore, the Kohler Pappen cardboard mill wanted to recover heat from the warm process water for economic reasons. The implementation of the measure was considered an opportunity to safeguard the production site.\n\nDespite the high product variety, the objective of the waste water treatment concept is to recirculate the highest possible ratio of purified water back to production in order to achieve a closed water circuit. Figure   6 .258 shows the flowsheet of the process water treatment at the Kohler Pappen mill including MBR.\n\n\nFigure 6.258:\tFlow chart of the process water treatment at the Kohler Pappen mill including MBR\n\n\nThe main components of the process water treatment concept at Kohler Pappen are given below:\n\nA bow screen to remove plastic rejects, foamed polystyrene and other trash material.\nA primary settling tank for fibre recovery.\nA decarbonisation reactor including a clarifier. The controlled removal of calcium is necessary because the use of mixed paper for recycling as raw material and the well-closed water circuits increase the risk of calcium carbonate scaling on the membranes. Soda, lime milk and iron(II) chloride and some acid are added to the calcium-rich waste water, are mixed, and microparticles of calcium carbonate are formed. The added flocculant agents and the proper mixing help build agglomerated particles of calcium carbonate that can be separated by sedimentation and removed with a sludge rake and a pump. The pumpable suspension of calcium carbonate has a concentration of 50 g/l to 300 g/l and is used as a filler for cartonboard grades. The target value is to keep a calcium concentration of 50 mg/l.\nAn activated sludge cascade (600 m3, biomass concentration 10 - 12 g/l, food to mass ratio <0.2 kg BOD/kg SSxd ).\nThree parallel operating submerged hollow fibre membrane units (average pore size: 0.04 microns which corresponds to ultrafiltration). Each tank holds 10 m3, and contains three racks of membranes which hold 16 modules of membranes each. This gives 5 000 m2 of total membrane surface with a calculated flux of 8 l/m2 x h. \nTo reduce the remaining dissolved salts of the filtrate from the MBR plant, a partial flow (up to 50 % of the MBR filtrate) can be further cleaned by a two-stage reverse osmosis (maximum 15 bar). At the time of writing (2013), the Reverse Osmosis (RO) is operated only with low capacity as a kind of police filter for different types of salts because no precipitation of CaCO3 occurs.\n\nBy recirculating the filtrate from the MBR and the partial flow of the reverse osmosis permeate, the original flow of the waste water could be reduced by more than 90 %. The remaining flow (approximately 0.6 m3/t) of the waste water (the concentrate of the reverse osmosis) is fed into the municipal sewage treatment plant in Gengenbach.\nThe average power consumption of the treatment plant (decarbonisation, activated sludge, MBR, reverse osmosis) is 2.3 kWh/kg CODeliminated or 2.0 kWh/kg CODeliminated without reverse osmosis. Around 650 kg dewatered biosludge per day is generated which has to be further treated or disposed of. For the decarbonisation unit, flocculation chemicals are used.\n\nThe achieved average waste water quality, after the primary clarifier, of the MBR filtrate, the Reverse Osmosis (RO) permeate and the Reverse Osmosis (RO) concentrate are compiled in Table   6 .150 (2010 data).\n\n\nTable 6.150:\tAchieved average waste water quality along the different treatment steps of the Gengenbach cartonboard mill\n\n\nThe costs for the process water treatment of the Kohler cartonboard mill are partially compensated for by energy recovery (less heating of fresh water as the heat content of the recirculated filtrate can be used), the recovered CaCO3 that is reused as filler and the fact that this treatment is considerably cheaper than the alternative treatment in the municipal waste water treatment. Considering the investment, the total specific costs are in the range of EUR 0.50/m3 which is slightly more than the specific costs to be paid to the municipality in 2007 before the construction of the on-site treatment. The specific total costs of EUR 0.50/m3 can still be reduced by 30 % because the water quality of the MBR filtrate is already suited to supplying all parts of the cartonboard production without using the reverse osmosis unit. The water hardness has been reduced sufficiently by the decarbonisation unit, so that the installed reverse osmosis is not required as a 'kidney' for the removal of salts or calcium. On the other hand, if decarbonisation of the process water is required, around EUR 0.22/m3 has to be added.\n\nEconomics \nThe costs of the MBR system (investment and operational costs) are higher than for the standard aerobic two-stage system suspended carrier reactor plus low-loaded activated sludge treatment.\n\nA recent case study determined operational and total costs of different MBR systems by use of a realistic model for the treatment of a partial flow of the paper mill effluent after primary treatment. The cost assessment included the activated sludge bioreactor. The data were derived in coordination with engineering companies and manufacturers . The total operational costs for MBR with submerged membranes and with aerated tubular cross-flow membranes amounted to EUR 0.22/m3. This cost includes the specific energy consumption of the activated sludge bioreactor (EUR 0.05/m3), the specific energy consumption of the membrane stage (EUR 0.06/m3), membrane replacement and spares costs, costs for nutrients, defoamers and cleaning chemicals and personnel costs. The operational costs of different MBR systems for the treatment of paper mill effluents vary between EUR 0.18/m3 and EUR 0.28/m3. All MBR systems examined were UF systems, i.e. pore size <0.1 um (energy cost assumed is EUR 0.06/kWh). The specific total annual costs (capital + operational costs) are in the range of EUR 0.56 - 0.59/m3.\n\nAlthough membrane prices have dropped significantly and the life expectancy of the membranes has increased, the MBR is still more expensive than traditional biological systems. However, to evaluate the total costs, benefits such as water recirculation, energy recovery, reliability of the process, effluent quality achieved and reduced costs for sludge treatment also have to be taken into account.\n\nAchieved emissions to water of RCF paper mills with and without deinking after aerobic treatment are shown in Table   6 .151. In Table   6 .151, the major paper groups considered, the products manufactured, the kinds of fibre furnish used and the type of treatment applied are indicated. The reference year is 2006 and for some mills 2008.\n\n\nTable 6.151:\tAnnual average emissions to water from RCF paper mills with and without deinking after aerobic treatment\nFurther data on achieved emissions are given in Section 6.2.2.5. The achievable removal efficiency is in the range of 95 - 99 % for BOD5 and 75 - 90 % for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Removal efficiencies by use of combined anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment are usually slightly higher than aerobic treatment only (see Table   6 .147 in Section 6.3.7).\n\nBOD levels exceeding 25 mg O2/l over a longer time period are an indicator of disturbances in the biological processes. Adjustment of the operating parameters and/or analysis of the biomass are required to recover the treatment plant performance. \n\nRecycling part of the water after biological treatment seems to be possible for both RCF paper with and without deinking. However, RCF paper mills manufacturing deinked grades recycle no more than 10 % of the treated waste water to the paper mill whereas some RCF mills manufacturing corrugated medium recycle up to 30 % of the treated water. A few mills even run completely closed water circuits (see Section 6.3.4).\n\nDuring aerobic waste water treatment, excess sludge is produced which has to be thickened, dewatered and further treated. A typical value for activated sludge plants is in the range of 0.6 kg excess sludge/kg BOD5 eliminated (as Dry Solids (DS)) generated during treatment. Thus, depending on the quality of paper for recycling and on the process design, about 10 kg excess sludge from biological treatment per tonne of paper (on a dry basis) may be expected.\n\nUsually control parameters are measured daily or at least a few times a week. Continuous measurement is also used in some plants (see Section 2.2.2.1.2). Additional measurements to control the activated sludge system are necessary, e.g. O2 content, Sludge Volume Index (SVI) (sludge volume index), water flow, and at times analysis of the biomass.\n\nFor aeration of the active biomass (activated sludge) and for pumps, electrical energy is needed. The specific consumption of energy for degradation/elimination of 1 kg BOD5 amounts to \n0.6 - 3 kWh/kg BOD5 eliminated. If the system is well designed, a value of <1 kWh/kg BOD5 eliminated can be achieved .\n\n reported for the MBR treatment of a typical paper mill's waste water a power consumption of 0.90 kWh/m3 for the first biological stage and 0.5 kWh/m3 for the submerged membranes, i.e. a total specific power consumption of 1.4 kWh/m3.\n\nA RCF-based paper mill reported for its Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), which consists of primary clarification, a biological stage, secondary clarification and a sand filter, 1 - 1.2 kWh/kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) eliminated. The values include the turbo aerator, sludge dewatering, all pumps and other aggregates (like screens, scrapers, etc.).\n\nCross-media effects \nAerobic biological waste water treatment consumes energy (e.g. for aerators and pumps) and generates sludge that normally requires treatment before utilisation or disposal.\n\nEspecially during the summer period, the waste water treatment plant of RCF paper mills may emit annoying odours. If the waste water treatment is well designed and controlled, annoying odours can be avoided (see Section 2.9.14).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nApplicable to both new and existing mills. MBR normally show fewer emissions of P, N and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) originating from lost biomass and produce less sludge than a conventional biological treatment. Very low Total Suspended Solids (TSS) contents allow for reuse also in more sensitive areas of the production. However, only very few MBR plants are in operation in the pulp and paper industry. Mills manufacturing lower quality grades with well closed water circuits (e.g. a water intake below 8 m3/t) may face an increased risk of lime precipitation (scaling) after the bioreactor and a lime removal stage might be required. In some cases, additional fine screening (e.g. by a drum screen) is required in addition to normal primary treatment to protect the membranes from blocking. Another issue associated with MBR might be the biofouling of the membranes.\n\nEconomics\nData on costs are only available for an integrated paper mill manufacturing paper based on mechanical pulp. The waste water treatment system is comparable to the one applied for the treatment of effluent from processing paper for recycling. Therefore, the figures on costs can give a rough picture of the range of expected costs. The investment required for a completely new activated sludge treatment plant is approximately EUR 13.0 - 15.5 million for a new 1 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/day integrated mechanical pulp and paper mill. These costs also include the necessary primary treatment and sludge handling. The corresponding operating costs are EUR 1.2 - 1.5 million per year.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegal requirements.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous aerobic waste water treatment plants are operated in European RCF paper mills.\n\nMBR plants: Papeteries du Rhin (cartonboard, MBR with submerged membranes), FR; Papeterie Lacaux (MBR with external submerged membranes), FR; VHP Veiligheidspapierfabriek Ugchelen BV (MBR, thermophilic, with external cross-flow tubular membranes), NL; Kohler Pappen Gengenbach (MBR with external submerged membranes), DE; Papierfabrik Louisenthal in Gmund and Konigstein (MBR with external submerged membranes), DE.\n\nReference literature\n, ,  [ Questionnaires 2007 and 2009 ].\nMBR plants: , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2990384_abstract", "x": 0.6148485, "y": 0.3250917, "title": "WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM", "year": 2016, "text": "This water treatment system is provided with: a reverse osmosis membrane device (2); a biofilm treatment device (4) that has a carrier, on a surface of which is formed a biofilm, and that treats water to be treated (3) before the water to be treated (3) is transmitted through the reverse osmosis membrane device (2); and at least one of a water to be treated stoppage period circulation means (7) and a water to be treated stoppage period supply means (8) that are driven when the intake of new water to be treated (3) is stopped.

These substances are converted by different variants of biological treatment systems into biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Low-loaded aerobic activated sludge systems are widely used in the sector. The nutrient content in waste water of paper for recycling mills is generally low. \n\nExample MBR at Kohler Pappen, Gengenbach (DE)\nThe mill manufactures 35 000 tonnes/year of paper for recycling-based cartonboard (grey board) on three paper machines. Many different grades are produced, some of which are coloured. Before implementing the MBR, the waste water was purified by sedimentation only and was then sent to a common municipal biological treatment plant. The average product-specific amount of waste water is approximately 8 m3/t or 38 m3/day.\n\nThe municipality decided to drastically increase the waste water fees from EUR 0.35/m3 up to EUR 2.05/m3.

Considering the investment, the total specific costs are in the range of EUR 0.50/m3 which is slightly more than the specific costs to be paid to the municipality in 2007 before the construction of the on-site treatment. The specific total costs of EUR 0.50/m3 can still be reduced by 30 % because the water quality of the MBR filtrate is already suited to supplying all parts of the cartonboard production without using the reverse osmosis unit. The water hardness has been reduced sufficiently by the decarbonisation unit, so that the installed reverse osmosis is not required as a 'kidney' for the removal of salts or calcium. On the other hand, if decarbonisation of the process water is required, around EUR 0.22/m3 has to be added.\n\nEconomics \nThe costs of the MBR system (investment and operational costs) are higher than for the standard aerobic two-stage system suspended carrier reactor plus low-loaded activated sludge treatment.\n\nA recent case study determined operational and total costs of different MBR systems by use of a realistic model for the treatment of a partial flow of the paper mill effluent after primary treatment. The cost assessment included the activated sludge bioreactor. The data were derived in coordination with engineering companies and manufacturers . The total operational costs for MBR with submerged membranes and with aerated tubular cross-flow membranes amounted to EUR 0.22/m3. This cost includes the specific energy consumption of the activated sludge bioreactor (EUR 0.05/m3), the specific energy consumption of the membrane stage (EUR 0.06/m3), membrane replacement and spares costs, costs for nutrients, defoamers and cleaning chemicals and personnel costs. The operational costs of different MBR systems for the treatment of paper mill effluents vary between EUR 0.18/m3 and EUR 0.28/m3. All MBR systems examined were UF systems, i.e. pore size <0.1 um (energy cost assumed is EUR 0.06/kWh). The specific total annual costs (capital + operational costs) are in the range of EUR 0.56 - 0.59/m3.\n\nAlthough membrane prices have dropped significantly and the life expectancy of the membranes has increased, the MBR is still more expensive than traditional biological systems. However, to evaluate the total costs, benefits such as water recirculation, energy recovery, reliability of the process, effluent quality achieved and reduced costs for sludge treatment also have to be taken into account.\n\nAchieved emissions to water of RCF paper mills with and without deinking after aerobic treatment are shown in Table   6 .151. In Table   6 .151, the major paper groups considered, the products manufactured, the kinds of fibre furnish used and the type of treatment applied are indicated. The reference year is 2006 and for some mills 2008.\n\n\nTable 6.151:\tAnnual average emissions to water from RCF paper mills with and without deinking after aerobic treatment\nFurther data on achieved emissions are given in Section 6.2.2.5. The achievable removal efficiency is in the range of 95 - 99 % for BOD5 and 75 - 90 % for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Removal efficiencies by use of combined anaerobic-aerobic biological treatment are usually slightly higher than aerobic treatment only (see Table   6 .147 in Section 6.3.7).\n\nBOD levels exceeding 25 mg O2/l over a longer time period are an indicator of disturbances in the biological processes. Adjustment of the operating parameters and/or analysis of the biomass are required to recover the treatment plant performance. \n\nRecycling part of the water after biological treatment seems to be possible for both RCF paper with and without deinking. However, RCF paper mills manufacturing deinked grades recycle no more than 10 % of the treated waste water to the paper mill whereas some RCF mills manufacturing corrugated medium recycle up to 30 % of the treated water. A few mills even run completely closed water circuits (see Section 6.3.4).\n\nDuring aerobic waste water treatment, excess sludge is produced which has to be thickened, dewatered and further treated. A typical value for activated sludge plants is in the range of 0.6 kg excess sludge/kg BOD5 eliminated (as Dry Solids (DS)) generated during treatment. Thus, depending on the quality of paper for recycling and on the process design, about 10 kg excess sludge from biological treatment per tonne of paper (on a dry basis) may be expected.\n\nUsually control parameters are measured daily or at least a few times a week. Continuous measurement is also used in some plants (see Section 2.2.2.1.2). Additional measurements to control the activated sludge system are necessary, e.g. O2 content, Sludge Volume Index (SVI) (sludge volume index), water flow, and at times analysis of the biomass.\n\nFor aeration of the active biomass (activated sludge) and for pumps, electrical energy is needed. The specific consumption of energy for degradation/elimination of 1 kg BOD5 amounts to \n0.6 - 3 kWh/kg BOD5 eliminated. If the system is well designed, a value of <1 kWh/kg BOD5 eliminated can be achieved .\n\n reported for the MBR treatment of a typical paper mill's waste water a power consumption of 0.90 kWh/m3 for the first biological stage and 0.5 kWh/m3 for the submerged membranes, i.e. a total specific power consumption of 1.4 kWh/m3.\n\nA RCF-based paper mill reported for its Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), which consists of primary clarification, a biological stage, secondary clarification and a sand filter, 1 - 1.2 kWh/kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) eliminated. The values include the turbo aerator, sludge dewatering, all pumps and other aggregates (like screens, scrapers, etc.).\n\nCross-media effects \nAerobic biological waste water treatment consumes energy (e.g. for aerators and pumps) and generates sludge that normally requires treatment before utilisation or disposal.\n\nEspecially during the summer period, the waste water treatment plant of RCF paper mills may emit annoying odours. If the waste water treatment is well designed and controlled, annoying odours can be avoided (see Section 2.9.14).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nApplicable to both new and existing mills. MBR normally show fewer emissions of P, N and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) originating from lost biomass and produce less sludge than a conventional biological treatment. Very low Total Suspended Solids (TSS) contents allow for reuse also in more sensitive areas of the production. However, only very few MBR plants are in operation in the pulp and paper industry. Mills manufacturing lower quality grades with well closed water circuits (e.g. a water intake below 8 m3/t) may face an increased risk of lime precipitation (scaling) after the bioreactor and a lime removal stage might be required. In some cases, additional fine screening (e.g. by a drum screen) is required in addition to normal primary treatment to protect the membranes from blocking. Another issue associated with MBR might be the biofouling of the membranes.\n\nEconomics\nData on costs are only available for an integrated paper mill manufacturing paper based on mechanical pulp. The waste water treatment system is comparable to the one applied for the treatment of effluent from processing paper for recycling. Therefore, the figures on costs can give a rough picture of the range of expected costs. The investment required for a completely new activated sludge treatment plant is approximately EUR 13.0 - 15.5 million for a new 1 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/day integrated mechanical pulp and paper mill. These costs also include the necessary primary treatment and sludge handling.

These substances are converted by different variants of biological treatment systems into biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Low-loaded aerobic activated sludge systems are widely used in the sector. The nutrient content in waste water of paper for recycling mills is generally low. \n\nExample MBR at Kohler Pappen, Gengenbach (DE)\nThe mill manufactures 35 000 tonnes/year of paper for recycling-based cartonboard (grey board) on three paper machines. Many different grades are produced, some of which are coloured. Before implementing the MBR, the waste water was purified by sedimentation only and was then sent to a common municipal biological treatment plant. The average product-specific amount of waste water is approximately 8 m3/t or 38 m3/day.\n\nThe municipality decided to drastically increase the waste water fees from EUR 0.35/m3 up to EUR 2.05/m3. The mill also has to pay for the fresh water ('water cent'). Fresh water reduction and waste water volume reduction were therefore a necessity. Furthermore, the Kohler Pappen cardboard mill wanted to recover heat from the warm process water for economic reasons. The implementation of the measure was considered an opportunity to safeguard the production site.\n\nDespite the high product variety, the objective of the waste water treatment concept is to recirculate the highest possible ratio of purified water back to production in order to achieve a closed water circuit. Figure   6 .258 shows the flowsheet of the process water treatment at the Kohler Pappen mill including MBR.\n\n\nFigure 6.258:\tFlow chart of the process water treatment at the Kohler Pappen mill including MBR\n\n\nThe main components of the process water treatment concept at Kohler Pappen are given below:\n\nA bow screen to remove plastic rejects, foamed polystyrene and other trash material.\nA primary settling tank for fibre recovery.\nA decarbonisation reactor including a clarifier. The controlled removal of calcium is necessary because the use of mixed paper for recycling as raw material and the well-closed water circuits increase the risk of calcium carbonate scaling on the membranes. Soda, lime milk and iron(II) chloride and some acid are added to the calcium-rich waste water, are mixed, and microparticles of calcium carbonate are formed. The added flocculant agents and the proper mixing help build agglomerated particles of calcium carbonate that can be separated by sedimentation and removed with a sludge rake and a pump. The pumpable suspension of calcium carbonate has a concentration of 50 g/l to 300 g/l and is used as a filler for cartonboard grades. The target value is to keep a calcium concentration of 50 mg/l.\nAn activated sludge cascade (600 m3, biomass concentration 10 - 12 g/l, food to mass ratio <0.2 kg BOD/kg SSxd ).\nThree parallel operating submerged hollow fibre membrane units (average pore size: 0.04 microns which corresponds to ultrafiltration). Each tank holds 10 m3, and contains three racks of membranes which hold 16 modules of membranes each. This gives 5 000 m2 of total membrane surface with a calculated flux of 8 l/m2 x h. \nTo reduce the remaining dissolved salts of the filtrate from the MBR plant, a partial flow (up to 50 % of the MBR filtrate) can be further cleaned by a two-stage reverse osmosis (maximum 15 bar). At the time of writing (2013), the Reverse Osmosis (RO) is operated only with low capacity as a kind of police filter for different types of salts because no precipitation of CaCO3 occurs.\n\nBy recirculating the filtrate from the MBR and the partial flow of the reverse osmosis permeate, the original flow of the waste water could be reduced by more than 90 %. The remaining flow (approximately 0.6 m3/t) of the waste water (the concentrate of the reverse osmosis) is fed into the municipal sewage treatment plant in Gengenbach.\nThe average power consumption of the treatment plant (decarbonisation, activated sludge, MBR, reverse osmosis) is 2.3 kWh/kg CODeliminated or 2.0 kWh/kg CODeliminated without reverse osmosis. Around 650 kg dewatered biosludge per day is generated which has to be further treated or disposed of. For the decarbonisation unit, flocculation chemicals are used.\n\nThe achieved average waste water quality, after the primary clarifier, of the MBR filtrate, the Reverse Osmosis (RO) permeate and the Reverse Osmosis (RO) concentrate are compiled in Table   6 .150 (2010 data).\n\n\nTable 6.150:\tAchieved average waste water quality along the different treatment steps of the Gengenbach cartonboard mill\n\n\nThe costs for the process water treatment of the Kohler cartonboard mill are partially compensated for by energy recovery (less heating of fresh water as the heat content of the recirculated filtrate can be used), the recovered CaCO3 that is reused as filler and the fact that this treatment is considerably cheaper than the alternative treatment in the municipal waste water treatment.

In total, about 8 - 10 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of total condensates are formed with a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load of about 20 - 30 kg/t and 7 - 10 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of BOD5. Normally, about 1 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) is heavily polluted, 4 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) moderately polluted and 4 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) with a low level of contamination.\n\nThe Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is mainly methanol (5 - 10 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) with some ethanol and a number of organic sulphuric compounds (1 - 2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)), 1 - 2 kg of turpentine and inorganic nitrous compounds. Furthermore, foul condensate contains ketones, terpenes, phenolics, resin and fatty acids and various dissolved gases. A large proportion of nitrogen discharged from a kraft pulp mill is contained in condensates.\n\nAbout 1 m3 of condensate per tonne of pulp has a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration of 10 - 20 kg. The level is higher in condensates from hardwood pulp than from softwood. These strong condensates are normally treated in a stripper where the removal efficiency for most compounds is over 90 % depending on the pH. Stripping systems usually remove malodorous gases (Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)-contributing substances at the same time. Stripped condensates after treatment can be 1 - 1.5 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/m3 of condensate. The stripped gases can be inserted into a Concentrated Non-condensable Gases (CNCG) treatment system and handled appropriately, i.e. incinerated in a dedicated burner, the recovery boiler or the lime kiln.\n\nAbout 7 - 9 m3 of weaker condensates (with medium and low contamination) are formed with Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) ranging from 0.5 - 2 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/m3, containing a total of about 8 - 12 kg of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/t of pulp. \n\nAlternatively, moderately contaminated condensates can be stripped in a system linked to the evaporation plant, thereby effecting treatment without any substantial additional use of energy. In this way, the total Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load before any reuse is reduced to about 5 kg/t, a reduction of about 50 % compared to only treating the most contaminated condensates.\n\nThe stripping column can be a separate piece of equipment or it can be an integrated part of the evaporation plant. The condensates are fed to the top of the stripping column. Steam or vaporised condensate rises from the bottom of the column in a counter-current direction to the foul condensate. The overhead vapour from the stripping column is sent to a reflux condenser where it is partly condensed. The purpose of the reflux condenser is to condense some of the water and to increase the concentration of volatile material in the gases leaving the condenser. The non-condensable gases from the condenser contain the majority of the volatile compounds that are stripped in the stripping column. They are led to incineration where the organic and Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) compounds are destroyed by thermal oxidation.\n\nCleaned condensates are free of metals and therefore are particularly useful for washing in the bleach plant when aiming at closing up this part of the process. They can also be reused in brown stock washing, in the causticising area (mud washing and dilution, mud filter showers), as Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) scrubbing liquor for lime kilns or as white liquor make-up water. This means that some condensates will be used in closed parts of the process and will not be discharged to waste. Other condensates will be used in open parts, e.g. the bleach plant, and end up in the effluent together with those condensates which are not reused but discharged directly to waste.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of fresh water consumption, reduction of the organic pollution load to the waste water treatment plant, reduction of reduced sulphur compound (Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)) and methanol emissions to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe stripping of contaminated condensates is common in most mills. When the stripping system is used for the removal of high levels of methanol, the condensates from the stripping column are relatively clean and can be reused in the pulp mill for applications such as brown stock washing (see Section 3.3.10).\n\nThe basis for the design should be the minimisation of the flow to the stripping system by segregating the condensates in order to reduce the required investment. In the evaporation plant, the first liquor vapour condensate can be split into two fractions. The surface condenser can be split into two units or two condensing steps. The blow vapour from a batch digester can be condensed in two steps. Secondary steam can be used as the main steam source for the stripping column.\n\nThe best place to reuse the condensates is pulp washing, either in the last washer or on the decker in a mill with a closed screen-room water system. The typical wash water demand is 10 - 13 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The evaporator-area and digester-area condensate available for reuse can amount to 6 - 9 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), which is the amount of potential water savings. In total, the stripping of only the heavily polluted condensates would result in 4 - 6 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) while with stripping of the moderately contaminated condensates about 3 - 5 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) can be achieved. However, condensates discharged to effluent treatment are mostly readily biodegradable. Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) removal is about 97 % from the condensate, and methanol removal about 92 %.\n\n\nCross-media effects\nWhen steam stripping is used, the non-condensable gases (Non-condensable Gases (NCG)) have to be incinerated separately in order to avoid the release of concentrated Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) gases into the atmosphere. This is discussed in more detail in Sections 3.3.16.2 and 3.3.16.3.\n\nWhen the stripping of concentrated, contaminated condensates is applied the load to the waste water plant will be reduced and, if there are difficulties to meet the permit conditions, new investments in the effluent treatment plant may be avoided. This also means that less energy is needed for aeration and less energy and chemicals in the sludge treatment.\n\nWhen combining the recovery of clean condensates and stripped condensates, fresh water consumption may be decreased by 6 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). Because the condensates are hot, part of the energy used in the stripping column can be saved.\n\nFugitive Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from waste water treatment plants can be reduced by the steam stripping of condensates which removes Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) compounds from foul condensates. \n\nAs the stripper off-gases contain 8 - 12 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of methanol, there is the potential to save fuel oil or natural gas, provided that the stripper gas can replace the fuel.\n\nThe stripping of condensates reduces the low level emissions of Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) compounds from foul condensates. The Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) compounds include hydrogen sulphide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulphide and dimethyl disulphide. These emissions are partially responsible for the foul odours from a kraft mill.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSteam stripping is a viable in-plant treatment method for reducing Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and odour from kraft mill foul condensates. The process can be applied at both new and existing kraft mills. The condensate stripping column can be separate or it can be integrated into the evaporation plant. In the former case, live steam would be required whereas in the latter case, secondary steam from evaporator effects can be used. However, thermal oxidation of the vapours from the stripper system is necessary. Lime kilns, power boilers and separate Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) incinerators can be used for this purpose.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for the stripper system at a 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d kraft pulp mill is about EUR 2.0 - 2.5 million. Additional investment may be required to increase the capacity of the evaporation plant of the mill, but this depends very much on the existing evaporation plant configuration. Retrofitting costs can vary between EUR 1 million and 4 million.\n\nThe operating costs of condensate stripping consist mainly of the cost of steam used in stripping and maintenance. If the stripper is operated separately from the evaporation plant, the operating costs are significantly higher due to the demand for fresh steam. The costs are about EUR 0.6 - 0.7 million/yr. If the stripper is connected between the evaporation stages, the operating costs are lower, around EUR 0.3 - 0.4 million/yr.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe majority of kraft pulp mills in Europe carry out steam stripping of contaminated condensates from the cooking and evaporation plant. The stripping of contaminated condensates efficiently removes its odorous components. Stripped condensates may be reused in unbleached and bleached pulp washing and in causticising processes thus achieving reduced water consumption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous mills in Europe.\n\nReference literature\n.\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2949376_abstract", "x": 0.6594747, "y": 0.2628115, "title": "EXHAUST GAS PROCESSING SYSTEM AND EXHAUST GAS PROCESSING METHOD", "year": 2015, "text": "Provided is an air pollution control system including: a boiler 11 that is configured to combust a fuel F, a denitration apparatus 12 that is configured to remove nitrogen oxides in a flue gas 18 discharged from the boiler 11; an air heater 13 that is configured to recover heat of the flue gas 18 after denitration; a precipitator 14 that is configured to remove soot and dust contained in the flue gas 18 after heat recovery in the form of collected dust ash 16; a desulfurization apparatus 15 that is configured to remove sulfur oxides contained in the flue gas 18 after dust removal using limestone slurry 20 which is an absorbent; a dehydrator 32 that is configured to recover gypsum 31 from an absorbent 30 serving as desulfurized wastewater discharged from the desulfurization apparatus 15; a concentration apparatus 41 that is configured to remove some of water of dehydrated filtrate 33 from the dehydrator 32; a spray drying apparatus 50 provided with a spray unit that is configured to spray concentrated/dehydrated filtrate 33A concentrated by the concentration apparatus 41; and a flue gas introduction line L11 through which branch gas 18a branched from the flue gas 18 is introduced to the spray drying apparatus 50.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.21\" title=\"ESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\">\n<references_to>2.2.2.2, 2.6, 4.3.22</references_to>\n<referenced_by>4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\n\nDescription\nThe recovery boiler is the major source of SO2 and of particulate emissions of a sulphite pulp mill. Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers.

The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected.

Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete.

The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected.

The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3332863_abstract", "x": 0.65987396, "y": 0.26536193, "title": "AIR POLLUTION CONTROL SYSTEM", "year": 2018, "text": "Provided is an air pollution control system including: a denitration apparatus 12 that is configured to remove nitrogen oxides in a flue gas 18 discharged from a boiler 11; an air heater 13 that is configured to recover heat of the flue gas 18 after denitration; a precipitator 14 that is configured to remove soot and dust contained in the flue gas after heat recovery in the form of collected dust ash 16; a desulfurization apparatus 15 that is configured to remove sulfur oxides contained in the flue gas 18 after dust removal using limestone slurry 20 which is an absorbent; a dehydrator 32 that is configured to remove gypsum 31 from absorber slurry discharged from the desulfurization apparatus 15; a spray drying apparatus 50 provided with a spray unit that is configured to spray dehydrated filtrate 33 as desulfurization wastewater supplied from the dehydrator 32; a flue gas introduction line L11 through which a branch gas 18a branched from the flue gas 18 is introduced to the spray drying apparatus 50; a flue gas supply line L12 through which flue gas 18b returns to a main flue gas duct, the flue gas 18b being obtained after the dehydrated filtrate is dried by the spray drying apparatus; and a powder supply apparatus 60 that is configured to supply a powder 61 to the flue gas introduction line L11.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.21\" title=\"ESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\">\n<references_to>2.2.2.2, 2.6, 4.3.22</references_to>\n<referenced_by>4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\n\nDescription\nThe recovery boiler is the major source of SO2 and of particulate emissions of a sulphite pulp mill. Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers.

During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases.

Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning.

In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below).

Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3332864_abstract", "x": 0.66041124, "y": 0.265334, "title": "AIR POLLUTION CONTROL SYSTEM", "year": 2018, "text": "Provided is an air pollution control system including: a denitration apparatus 12 that is configured to remove nitrogen oxides in a flue gas 18 discharged from a boiler 11; an air heater 13 that is configured to recover heat of the flue gas 18 after denitration; a precipitator 14 that is configured to remove soot and dust contained in the flue gas after heat recovery in the form of collected dust ash 16; a desulfurization apparatus 15 that is configured to remove sulfur oxides contained in the flue gas 18 after dust removal using limestone slurry 20 which is an absorbent; a dehydrator 32 that is configured to remove gypsum 31 from absorber slurry discharged from the desulfurization apparatus 15; a spray drying apparatus 50 provided with a spray unit that is configured to spray dehydrated filtrate 33 as desulfurization wastewater supplied from the dehydrator 32; a flue gas introduction line L11 through which a branch gas 18a branched from the flue gas 18 is introduced to the spray drying apparatus 50; a flue gas supply line L12 through which flue gas 18b returns to a main flue gas duct, the flue gas 18b being obtained after the dehydrated filtrate is dried by the spray drying apparatus; and a powder supply apparatus 60 that is configured to supply a powder 61 to the flue gas introduction line L11.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.21\" title=\"ESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\">\n<references_to>2.2.2.2, 2.6, 4.3.22</references_to>\n<referenced_by>4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\n\nDescription\nThe recovery boiler is the major source of SO2 and of particulate emissions of a sulphite pulp mill. Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2889088_abstract", "x": 0.70923, "y": 0.321524, "title": "Flue gas treatment device", "year": 2015, "text": "A flue gas treatment device (1) is provided.

Furthermore, since a bidirectional transition flue is not required to be arranged in the integrated flue housing (14), the flue gas has a good flow uniformity, and further it is not required to arrange a flow equalization orifice plate in the flue, thus the flue gas has a small resistance, thereby reducing the power consumption of the draught fan and increasing the efficiency of the power plant.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.21\" title=\"ESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\">\n<references_to>2.2.2.2, 2.6, 4.3.22</references_to>\n<referenced_by>4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nESP or multistage cyclone and multistage venturi scrubbers or multistage double inlet downstream scrubbers on the recovery boiler\n\nDescription\nThe recovery boiler is the major source of SO2 and of particulate emissions of a sulphite pulp mill. Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3).

To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system.

As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions.

Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected.

Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals.

The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical.

During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2881162_abstract", "x": 0.6860338, "y": 0.29276899, "title": "Dry scrubber system with low load distributor device", "year": 2015, "text": "An air quality control system (AQCS) (14) useful for treating flue gas (FG), such as flue gas (FG) produced by a fossil fuel fired boiler (12) is described.

Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT).

Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper.

The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3951264_abstract", "x": 0.7265841, "y": 0.33794317, "title": "HEAT EXCHANGE FLUE AND HEAT EXCHANGE DEVICE", "year": 2022, "text": "A heat exchange flue, having a top flue gas chamber (1), a bottom flue gas chamber (10) and a heat exchange section (H) located therebetween.

Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105.

The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected.

Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected.

Other point sources are the biomass or bark boiler, steam blocks or other combustion units operated on site (see Section 2.6). Process-related, diffuse SO2 emissions to be considered are normally collected and introduced in the recovery boiler as combustion air (see Section 4.3.22).\n\nThe chemicals used in the cooking plant appear in the flue-gas in the form of light MgO ash and the sulphur as SO2. The MgO is recovered in a wet scrubber to a slurry of MgOH, which reacts with the SO2 to form fresh cooking liquor in another scrubber. In sulphite pulp mills, the recovery plant simultaneously fulfils the purpose of flue-gas cleaning and recovery of cooking chemicals.\n\nThe separation of dust is carried out in an electrostatic precipitator or in a multistage cyclone. Normally they are dimensioned in such a way that the cleaned gas leaving the filter releases at a maximum of 50 mg of dust/Nm3.\n\nFor the magnesium sulphite process, the dust retained in the ESP consists mainly of MgO but also to a lesser extent of Ca, Na or Ca compounds. The recovered MgO ash is suspended with water and cleaned by washing and slaking to form Mg(OH)2 which is then used as an alkaline scrubbing solution in the multistage scrubbers in order to recover the sulphur component of the cooking chemicals. After the removal of dust, the flue-gas is cooled down by passing through a cooling scrubber operated with water and it then enters a flue-gas scrubber with three or more stages where the SO2 emissions are scrubbed with this alkaline solution. The solution of Mg(OH)2 as a washing media is moved counter-current to the SO2-rich flue-gas flow and is transformed to magnesium bisulphite (Mg(HSO3)2). The solution is purged at the first scrubber with the highest SO2 concentration. The single stages of the scrubbers are operated and controlled according to the pH value. The product of the scrubbers is the diluted acid. The SO2-rich solution is returned to the liquor preparation where make-up SO2 is added. \n\nFor the ammonium sulphite process, the ammonia base (NH3) is not recovered, as it is decomposed in the combustion process in nitrogen. In this case, a 100 % fresh NH3 solution is needed as a scrubbing agent.\n\nIn Figure   4 .196 a simplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant is shown together with its integration in the cooking chemical preparation. \n\nFigure 4.196:\tSimplified flow chart of a flue-gas desulphurisation plant (multistage scrubbers and final washer) and its integration in cooking chemical preparation \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBy the use of this technique the majority of the cooking chemicals are recovered which leads to significant savings of raw materials. The chemical recovery (in the case of the magnesium sulphite process) simultaneously reduces the dust emissions to nearly zero and the initially very SO2-rich exhaust gas is cleaned to levels of around 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 during normal operating conditions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nVarious types of scrubbers for the recovery of SO2 are used in all sulphite mills in order to recover the chemicals from the spent cooking liquor. The recovery rate for SO2 can be \n99.4 - 99.8 % compared to the untreated emissions that leave the recovery boiler.\n\nWith regard to the emission data from the recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills, in most mills, two different operating conditions have to be distinguished: 'normal operating conditions' and periods of 'acid operation' (flushing and cleaning of the incrustation in the scrubbers and washer). The latter refer to an operation mode where the scrubbers are cleaned to prevent incrustations of magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Unwanted not readily soluble MgSO3 is formed in pipes, tanks and washers and over time leads to scaling and incrustations if not cleaned regularly. During the 'acid mode', the SO2-containing flue-gas is sent to the scrubber that is operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid that is circulated in the scrubbers. This leads to a decrease of the pH values and dissolves the magnesium monosulphite. During the cleaning cycles of the scrubber, the emissions increase as one of the scrubbers or the final washer is not operated and must be compensated for by the residual scrubbers. Common frequencies and time intervals for the acid operation mode are around 12 times a year and in total around 96 hours per year during which one scrubber or washer is not operated and the others take over the desulphurisation of the flue-gases. In total, acid operation may take about eight hours per month and a cleaning cycle may last six hours. Normally, scrubbers or washers operated with higher pH values are more often in the need of an acid flushing. For instance, a German mill reported that for the last washer, after the four-stage scrubbers, that operates with the highest pH value (sulphite stage), the maximum permitted operating time per cleaning under 'acid operation' is nine hours and should in total not exceed 365 hours per year. Other mills may also have shorter time intervals for preventive flushing of the washers. The results from the mills' reporting data are shown in Figure   4 .197.\n\nThe cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant can be carried out sequentially or as a the scrubbers can be completely shut down during cleaning. The latter option leads to higher emissions so some mills had to retrofit their process, e.g. by adding an additional washer in order to guarantee that a sufficient number of scrubbers/washers are always running. Despite the preventive cleaning of the flue-gas desulphurisation plant once or twice a year, a complete maintenance or revision of the device is carried out during the yearly downtime of the plant.\n\nIn most cases, these two different operating conditions should be considered when emissions are reported as concentrations (mg SO2/Nm3). In contrast, the specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) usually covers all operational modes during the year and therefore includes all operating conditions. In Germany and Austria, for example, there are different limit values for 'normal operating conditions' and 'exceptional cleaning operations'.\n\nVariations of the described dust/SO2 control systems are applied in all magnesium-based sulphite mills. However, different reduction efficiencies for SO2 removal are reported. SO2 emissions also depend on the design and operation of the flue-gas washers. Dust emissions depend as well on the design of the droplet catcher after the final washer and the type of wood used (see example 2 further below). The released sulphur dioxide emission levels are closely related to the system for recovery of spent cooking liquor (see Figure   4 .174). The flue-gas from the incineration of the concentrated black liquor carries a considerable amount of SO2 gas which depends on the sulphidity of the spent liquor. In order to recover more pure SO2 (and not only bisulphites) and to increase the quality of the recovered raw acid, some mills have implemented a SO2 liquefaction step for the liquefaction of the strong SO2-containing off-gas from the digesters (two mills in DE and AT). Another, albeit more expensive, technique to recover more SO2 from the flue-gas is the separation of magnesium monosulphite and its transformation into magnesium and liquid SO2 in a separate furnace (one mill in AT). Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2859935_abstract", "x": 0.6773127, "y": 0.34080616, "title": "Method and apparatus for wet desulfurization spray towers", "year": 2015, "text": "A method and apparatus or system (10) is provided for cleaning a flue gas and/or cooling a flue gas with a dispersed finely divided absorption liquid.

Also, this measure reduces the need for fresh make-up sulphur dioxide that in some cases may limit the recovery of SO2 from the flue-gas.\n\nTo control these emissions, the proper layout and operation of all the emission control devices (multicyclone or electrostatic precipitator, multistage scrubbers) are necessary. \n\nDuring normal operating conditions, 100 - 300 mg SO2/Nm3 is achieved as a daily average value, with a reference oxygen content of 5 %. Sulphur dioxide is measured continuously and led to the computer that registers the emission profile on-line.\n\nDuring the regular flushing and cleaning of the scrubbers/washers in the 'acid operation' mode, concentrations of SO2 in the flue-gas increase and values of up to 300 - 500 mg/Nm3 with some higher values up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, can be achieved. Some mills report slightly higher SO2 emissions especially during the cleaning mode. The time interval for the cleaning of the scrubbers is normally once or twice per month and lasts 6 - 12 hours. Dust emissions are not affected by the 'acid operation' mode.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.197:\tReported duration of acid operation\n\n\nIn many mills dust emissions of 5 - 20 mg/Nm3 as a daily average value, and with a reference oxygen content of 5 %, are achieved. In most cases, dust is measured periodically by single measurements.\n\nConcerning dust emissions, it should be taken into account that the concentrated spent liquor is dispersed finely into the combustion chamber of the recovery boiler. There, aerosols such as oxidised Na and K compounds may be built which in some cases cannot be completely separated in the subsequent wet flue-gas treatment. Besides the formation of aerosols (particle size <1 mm) that depend on the entry of alkali metals with the wood and the combustion temperature, the charge of fresh water into the last scrubber and the efficiency of the last droplet separator before the cleaned gas enters the stack affect the dust removal efficiency of the scrubbers. At some mills, dust emissions are reported to be slightly higher, i.e. 30 mg/Nm3, because of the higher potassium content of some wood species such as beech. The potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). For installations with a higher K2O/Na2O content in the concentrated spent liquor (e.g. when mainly beech is used), the flue-gas scrubbers using counter-current washers instead of venturi stages are more efficient for dust removal .\n\nBelow, two examples of the performance of SO2 emission control systems are given: a smaller (50 000 t/yr) sulphite pulp mill, and a recently built recovery boiler with a chemical recovery system.\n\nExample 1: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\nMondi Neusiedler, Austria, is an example of a small sulphite pulp mill manufacturing around 50 000 tonnes of bleached sulphite pulp for papermaking from softwood (84 % to 88 % ISO brightness) and around 100 000 tonnes of uncoated fine paper. It operates three-stage scrubber with very few 'acid modes' as it has shifted the maintenance of the scrubbers and pipes to the two regular shutdowns during the year. Larger mills possess one or two more flue-gas scrubbers or washers and every month operate one scrubber in a preventive acid 'maintenance mode'. Data on these small mills are presented further below.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite pulping process; Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleaching (the bleaching sequence is EOP-P-P); the net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt); only wood chips are used; the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir); magnesium oxide is used as a base; the pH in the digesters is 2; the year of construction of the ESP and the scrubbers is 1987; the gas flow is 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 880 000 Nm3/day; a small amount of natural gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/day).\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system consists of an electrostatic precipitator and a counterflow three-stage scrubber. Three venturi-type scrubbers are installed. For the small mill, the number is considered sufficient since during acid operation the gas flow of the recovery boiler is reduced. No scrubber is operated continuously in the maintenance mode. Instead, around once a month, one venturi is cleaned by an acid solution for four to eight hours during which only two scrubbers are working at a reduced capacity of the recovery boiler. Additionally, the pulp mill has two downtimes of three or four days per year during which the scrubbers are mechanically cleaned and maintained.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The latter refer to an operational mode where the scrubbers are cleaned of incrustations (MgSO3, CaSO4). During this acid mode the SO2-rich flue-gas is sent to the scrubbers that are operated without adding the Mg(OH2) to the washing liquid. The wash medium circulated in the scrubbers is only water, partly absorbing the SO2 of the flue-gas, thus turning the conditions into acid and washing the surfaces and nozzles of the scrubber. Therefore, the emissions rise during the cleaning cycles of the scrubber. In the case of the example, the acid operation mode is not normally applied but instead usually when emission levels rise. On average, for four to eight hours once a month only two scrubbers are working and the third is cleaned by an acid solution. The limit value for SO2 during that period is 600 mg/Nm3. Measured values can reach emission levels of 400 - 600 mg SO2/Nm3 in some cases. If the measurement exceeds this limit, it is reported separately. The total number of incidents reported in 2008 were 18 short time peaks (half-hourly values). The yearly average specific SO2 load (SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) covers all operational modes during the year. No changes in dust level are observed during acid operation.\n\nTable 4.103:\tAtmospheric emissions at 5 % oxygen from the recovery boiler of a small Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) pulp/year for papermaking\n\n\nAfter the thorough maintenance of the scrubbers twice a year during the regular shutdown, SO2 emission levels are around 15 - 20 mg/Nm3 for several weeks. Over time the emission levels build up towards higher values. Normal values as a daily average are 20 - 100 for 10 months of the year (in 2008). The emission levels at their maximum can reach 450 mg/Nm3 for around one or two days of operation. If this happens, a pipe or a part of the scrubbers is clogged with encrusted material which is then immediately removed. During that time only two scrubbers are in operation and therefore higher SO2 emissions occur.\n\nDust emissions are not monitored continuously because they are almost completely recovered by the ESP and the three-stage scrubbers. In this mill, the wet scrubbers remove dust very efficiently down to undetectable levels.\n\nExample 2: Lenzing AG\n\nThis is an example of the most recently built sulphite pulp recovery boilers including the associated chemical recovery plant (2007). Lenzing AG, Austria, is a pulp mill manufacturing dissolving pulp for viscose. There are other mills that reach similar performance levels. However, most of them have higher SO2 emissions during 'acid operation mode'.\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill uses the acid bisulphite process for the manufacturing of pulp for the textile industry; the net production of pulp in 2008 was 246 411 bone dry tonnes/year or 273 790 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/year; the wood species used is 100 % beech; the base used is magnesium; the pH in the digesters is \n1.2 - 1.5; the new recovery boiler was built in 2007; the gas flow of the new boiler is 8 200 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to 130 900 Nm3/h (at 5 % O2); a small amount of natural gas and fuel oil is added to the flame to support combustion.\n\nWhen assessing the specific emission data originating from the recovery boiler, it should be taken into consideration that at the site a total of three recovery boilers of different ages and types of construction are operated. They have different SO2 removal efficiency. The oldest and specifically worst recovery boiler is operated in standby mode. The new recovery boiler has a proportion of 50 % in terms of load capacity.\n\nii) Abatement techniques applied\nThe flue-gas cleaning system for MgO and SO2 removal consists of four technical units: 1) a dry dust separator (multistage cyclone) that separates dry MgO being used for neutralising the spent liquor from the digesters; 2) a cooling scrubber that saturates the flue-gas with water and removes further MgO, hydratising it into Mg(OH)2; 3) the flue-gas that leaves the saturator enters into a counterflow four-stage venturi washer with two bisulphite and two monosulphite scrubbers (plus a cooling scrubber that cools down the incoming flue-gas); 4) the Mg(OH)2 thin sludge is separated from the water in a clarifying tank and then used as washing liquid for the scrubbers.\n\nThe wet absorption system (multistage double inlet downstream scrubber) consists of a downwards pass-through double-flow bisulphite stage equipped with circulating pumps; a second upwards pass-through bisulphite stage that is followed by two (in series) connected upwards pass-through (mono)sulphite stages. The injected Mg(OH)2 solution is absorbed by the flue-gas and removed by a downstream droplet catcher from which it is recirculated. The two (mono)sulphite stages are connected in series and are operated at pHs of 6.9 and 7. They transform SO2 and Mg(OH)2 into almost insoluble magnesium monosulphite (MgSO3). Each venturi washer has an internal circulation of the Mg(OH)2 solution. The crystal (MgSO3) is transferred to the second bisulphite stage and from there to the first bisulphite stage where it is extensively transformed into Mg(HSO3)2, the unclarified raw acid.\n\nDuring 'normal operating conditions' the absorber stages are operated in series. To remove the built-up incrustations from the absorbers, they are regularly cleaned in an 'acid mode'. While one of the monosulphite stages is being cleaned the recovery rate for SO2 is temporarily reduced; the emissions of SO2 can reach 650 mg/Nm3. Normally the cleaning cycle lasts around 12 hours for the first and 18 hours for the second monosulphite stage and is carried out once or twice a month.\n\niii) Achieved emissions\nThe mill reported emissions in 2008 during 'normal operating conditions' and during periods of 'acid operation'. The specific SO2 load expressed as SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) as a yearly average value covers all operational modes during the year. The emission levels presented in Table   4 .104 refer to the newest recovery boiler built in 2008 only, which has a share of 50 % in terms of thick liquor load. The SO2 removal efficiency during 'normal operation' is around 99.8 %; for dust removal around 95 %. Sulphur dioxide emissions are measured continuously by automatic analysers and are usually between 20 - 80 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily average value (5 % O2). There are higher values during the acid flushing operational mode of around 150 - 350 mg SO2/Nm3 as a daily mean or reaching up to 650 mg SO2/Nm3 as half-hourly measured value. The higher values are determined during 1 - 2 days a month (see above). During that time, only three scrubbers are in operation. \n\n\nTable 4.104:\tAtmospheric emissions from the recovery boiler equipped with five-stage scrubbers of a large Austrian sulphite pulp mill manufacturing 273 790 tonnes of viscose pulp/year for the textile industry \n\n\nThe evaluation of the measured data is carried out on-line by a computer-based system. O2, SO2, NOX and CO are measured on-line. Dust is measured once a year by an external laboratory. The amount of fuel is recorded and the corresponding gas flow calculated. Multiplying the gas flow determined (Nm3/h) with the operating hours gives the loads released to air.\n\nIt should be noted that for the manufacturing of dissolving pulp, the pulp yield is lower than for paper pulp production. As a consequence, the quantity of the thick liquor generated is higher as is the specific gas flow (Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). This effect has to be taken into account when comparing specific loads to air from different recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills. \n\nIn the example mill, the total dust emissions from the recovery boiler after leaving the scrubbers are around 0.2 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The main reason for the higher dust emissions is that the potassium content of beech is twice as high as that of spruce (1 045 mg/kg of wood versus 510 mg/kg of wood). In the combustion chamber, gaseous K2SO4 is generated which, by quenching, is transformed into an aerosol in the boiler. The aerosol of potassium sulphate cannot even be removed by the five-stage wet scrubber as described above. Only a reduction of the temperature in the combustion chamber can lower the remaining dust emissions. Analysis of the particle size distribution of the released dust has shown very small particle sizes: 70 - 95 % of the dust has a particle size of 0.8 mm or <0.8 mm. Analysis of the chemical composition of the released dust showed a high proportion of K and Na and very little Mg although magnesium is used as an absorbent solution in the scrubbers. More than 50 % of the dust is sulphate; potassium has by far the largest share among the kations.\n\nAchieved emissions of example European pulp mills that have implemented ESPs and/or multicyclones\n\nThe emissions from recovery boilers from sulphite pulp mills that have implemented dust abatement (ESPs or multicyclones) and multistage scrubbers or washers for the recovery of SO2 and the inorganic dust from the flue-gas are summarised in Table   4 .105. The data in the table are taken from filled-in questionnaires and personal communication with mill operators. The total emissions do not include the auxiliary or bark boilers. The list of mills is a selection of well performing mills where data were available or provided and is therefore not intended to be complete. Sampling and analysis were performed according to the quality assurance measures that apply in the given countries. Further details on monitoring can be found in Section 2.2.2.2. The emissions of the gaseous components were determined with standardised measurement methods, i.e. with officially approved measurement instruments. It can be concluded that in some cases the number of stages of the desulphurisation plant has less influence on the emission level than the design of the scrubbers (inner and outer circle, upwards/downwards flowthrough, droplet catchers) and the operation (pH, flow speed, concentration of wash solution, actual load compared to maximum design capacity) and maintenance of the absorber stages (cleaning sequences and modes). Efficient systems guarantee a close contact between absorbent solution and exhaust gas flow. Relatively short time intervals for the 'cleaning mode' of a scrubber may lead to slightly higher SO2 emissions and vice versa.\n\n\nTable 4.105:\tExamples of emissions to air from recovery boilers of some pulp mills in Europe, excluding emissions from auxiliary boilers (reference year: 2008) \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNo relevant negative cross-media effects are to be expected. In the case of the magnesium sulphite process, the contaminants of the flue-gas are recovered and reused as cooking chemicals. The separated fly ash (mainly MgO and to a minor extent Na2O, K2O and CaO and their sulphates and chlorides, silicates and ferrous compounds) is suspended in water, hydrolysed and the generated Mg(OH)2 is recovered from the bottom of the hydration tanks. The overflow contains mainly inorganic compounds and is sent to the waste water treatment plant.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measures for SO2 emission reduction can be considered a process-integrated technique because the liquids used in the scrubbers (Mg(OH)2) and the washed-off SO2 are reused in the process as a cooking chemical. The technique is applicable to both new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe recovery of SO2 from the incineration of spent liquor is essential for the preparation of cooking liquor and carried out for both economic and environmental reasons. However, better performing systems are usually implemented for further reduction of the acidification potential of SO2. Better performing systems are characterised by an additional scrubber stage for SO2 absorption.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe use similar systems.\n\nReference literature\n,  [ SEPA-report 4008, 1992 ], [ data from site visits 2009 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3569595_abstract", "x": 0.52901006, "y": 0.16791849, "title": "PROCESS AND DEVICE FOR SEPARATING MELAMINE CRYSTALS IN A PRODUCTION PROCESS OF MELAMINE FROM UREA", "year": 2019, "text": "A process is described for the recovery of melamine crystals in suspension in the crystallization mother liquor and the relative device.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.12\" title=\"Use of correctly dimensioned buffer tanks for the storage of concentrated or hot liquids from the process\">\n<references_to>3.3.9</references_to>\n<referenced_by>2.9.11.2.1, 3.3.9, 3.3.13, 4.3, 4.3.14</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nUse of correctly dimensioned buffer tanks for the storage of concentrated or hot liquids from the process\n\nThis measure is connected to the measure discussed in Section 3.3.9.\n\nDescription\nFor prevention of peak loads and occasional upsets in the effluent treatment process, containers for cooking and recovery liquors and dirty condensates should have a storage capacity exceeding normal operating volumes by at least 30 %.

A basic demand for storage volumes is caused by the liquor concentration, measured as dry solids content. For instance, in an old kraft pulp mill the weak black liquor concentration can be 8 % and the strong liquor concentration 60 % as opposed to 16 % and 75 % in a modern mill. This means that proportionally the storage volumes must be considerably larger in mills with low-efficiency washing of unbleached pulp or standard evaporation plants without liquor concentrator units. \n\nThe additional volume required above the normal level must be able to contain peak process flows of a few hours due to operational disturbances. The volume must further be large enough so that enough weak liquor can be stored, that the evaporation plant can operate normally despite a short shutdown in cooking and washing or that a part of a multi-line or a single-line evaporation plant can be shut down briefly for maintenance. The storage volume must also be large enough to store enough strong liquor so that problems or short-lived production cuts in the recovery boiler can be solved without decreasing evaporation throughput or so that the evaporation plant can be shut down briefly for maintenance.\n\nExisting mills considering the implementation of oxygen delignification must assess their weak and strong liquor storage and evaporation plant capacity, because this process step is likely to increase the amount of water going through evaporation.\n\nLiquors after the recovery boiler and with additional process steps reformed to fresh cooking liquor are free of organics but have a very high pH value. These liquor tanks also need buffer capacity for short-lived peak flows or, for instance, for shutdowns in connected process units such as liquor filters.

The storage volume must also be large enough to store enough strong liquor so that problems or short-lived production cuts in the recovery boiler can be solved without decreasing evaporation throughput or so that the evaporation plant can be shut down briefly for maintenance.\n\nExisting mills considering the implementation of oxygen delignification must assess their weak and strong liquor storage and evaporation plant capacity, because this process step is likely to increase the amount of water going through evaporation.\n\nLiquors after the recovery boiler and with additional process steps reformed to fresh cooking liquor are free of organics but have a very high pH value. These liquor tanks also need buffer capacity for short-lived peak flows or, for instance, for shutdowns in connected process units such as liquor filters. These liquors, if sewered out to the effluent treatment plant, cause pH shocks which, if poorly controlled before biological treatment, result in upsets.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction in the discharge of concentrated or hot process streams towards the biological effluent treatment plant prevents the potential upset of the active biomass and severe disturbances to the plant performance.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThere are many ways to solve liquor spills and overflow containment in the process. The limitations to efficient implementation of these measures come from mill-specific process bottlenecks, typically in pulp washing and screening or evaporation.\n\nThe risk of upsets in an external treatment plant is reduced when accidental discharges of the incoming stream, which has a high organic and sometimes toxic load or a continuously high or low pH, can be avoided. The effect on hydraulic loading is not as pronounced except in mills where the washing and screening water system is open.\n\nConductivity probes are suitable for detecting and evaluating mill liquor spills, because in many cases a conductivity-liquor concentration correlation for each specific stream can be established. In low-concentration streams with varying pH, an on-line pH probe is standard.\n\nHot streams needing specific monitoring in the sewer can be readily monitored with on-line temperature probes. \n\nCross-media effects\nChanges in liquor and hot liquid tanks and the operation of an effective spill control system often require changes or improvements in other equipment, especially in pulp washing or evaporation. The handling of hot liquids requires 5 - 10 % more energy in the evaporation plant. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe optimisation of the necessary buffer storage capacity for hot or concentrated streams is applicable for both new and existing mills. These measures not only help to maintain valuable process chemicals in the production process and improve the process economy, but also considerably affect the environmental performance of the mill. In existing mills the solution to efficient process stream containment also lies in the key process equipment itself. Thus the building of buffer storage and spill containment vessels should be done in conjunction with the evaluation of other cost-effective improvements, especially in pulp washing and screening, evaporation and liquor filtering.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for 1 500 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d pulp production is about EUR 0.8 - 1.0 million for two 3 000 m3 storage tanks including the necessary piping, insulation and pumps with electrical power and process control.\n\nRecovery of concentrated process liquors allows for recovering fuel (e.g. black liquor) or the reusable chemicals that these streams may contain.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThese measures are promoted for environmental and process safety reasons.\n\nExample plants \nMost mills around the word.\n\nReference literature\nNone provided.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3492175_abstract", "x": 0.48037955, "y": 0.5279785, "title": "ELECTROSTATIC PRECIPITATOR SYSTEM HAVING A GRID FOR COLLECTION OF PARTICLES", "year": 2019, "text": "The present invention relates to an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) system (1) for removal of particles from a flue gas flowing in a flow passage (4) being delimited by a primary collection in the form of a collection plate (5).

The particles become negatively charged and migrate towards positively charged collection plates. The collection plates are rapped or vibrated periodically, dislodging the material so that it falls into collection hoppers below.\n\nIt is important that ESP rapping cycles are optimised to minimise particulate re-entrainment. Differences in the performance of ESPs depend on the design and dimensioning of the electrostatic filters and on a number of operational parameters, such as the flue-gas flow rate, the gas temperature, the start and stop operation, the number of fields, the strength of the electric field, the area and the shape of the electrodes, the SO2 concentration and the maintenance work carried out. In particular, performance can be impaired by the build-up of material forming an insulating layer on the electrodes and so reducing the electric field. This effect needs to be controlled.\n\nAfter leaving the recovery boiler, the exhaust gases are normally divided into two streams and led in parallel through electrostatic precipitators (ESPs). The two streams allow one ESP to be shut down for cleaning or maintenance work when it is needed. The ESPs in the two streams are typically sized to handle 65 % or more of the total gas flow from the boiler to allow service and maintenance without shutting down the boiler. Cleaning is needed regularly in order to remove the incrustation of Na2SO4 that is built up during normal operation.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRemoval of dust (particulate matter). Dust emissions from recovery boilers mainly consist of fine dust (<2 mm), see Figure   3 .84.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFigure   3 .123 and Figure   3 .126 summarise the reported dust emissions from recovery boilers of European kraft pulp mills. In Figure   3 .123, the dust emissions are plotted as annual average concentration values (Nm3, dry, at 6 % O2) for those mills that reported concentration values. Mills that use ESPs only or ESPs together with wet scrubbers are shown.\n\nFigure 3.123:\tYearly average concentration of dust emissions from recovery boilers after the ESP or the ESP and wet scrubbers\n\n\nESPs with emissions of <10 - 30 mg dust/Nm3 as an annual average (or 10 - 40 mg/Nm3 (6 % O2) determined as a daily average value) are achieved. Design criteria, process control and maintenance of the ESPs, optimal high voltage supplies, proper sizing and an appropriate number of electrical fields are important factors for a good ESP performance. The achieved levels depend not only on technical aspects but also on the targets set by the competent authorities or by the operator itself.\n\nFigure   3 .124 shows an example of a well-dimensioned ESP together with good gas flow distribution into the ESP and an optimised ESP cleaning regime. The daily average data over a complete year are shown. The data are taken from the on-line transfer of emission data to the competent authority. Dust is measured continuously. Dust emissions are reduced down to \n15 - 20 mg/Nm3 based on daily average values (dry gas, 273 K, 6 % O2).\n\nFigure 3.124:\tContinuously measured daily average dust emissions downstream of the ESP of a kraft pulp recovery boiler \n\n\nThe reported short-term dust emissions are shown in Figure   3 .125.\n\n\nFigure 3.125:\tDust emissions from recovery boilers as short-term average\n\n\nFigure   3 .126 shows the reported dust emissions from recovery boilers of European kraft pulp mills. The mills are those shown in Figure   3 .123 and additionally those that reported dust emission loads only (no concentration values). Dust is expressed in annual average emission loads (kg dust/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). Mills that use ESPs only or ESPs together with wet scrubbers are distinguished.\n\n\nFigure 3.126:\tYearly average dust emission loads from recovery boilers after the ESP or the ESP and wet scrubbers\n\n\nChanges in fuel and dry solids content and the recovery boiler load may create disturbances for the ESP performance. However, there are ways to determine what fuel variations and changes in boiler output levels can be accepted by the operating ESPs. Monitoring the ESP input power (kV, mA, spark rate), along with monitoring the dust removal system operation, can be helpful in keeping the system operating at optimum levels. For example, if the output of a recovery boiler is increased there will be a larger amount of gas flow and dust to be collected in the ESP. By monitoring the T/R input power levels compared to the minimal values established by plant operations to meet the allowable emissions from the plant, the operators can determine the maximum load that the boiler can operate while staying in compliance. All of the systems associated with the ESP including the capacity of the dust removal system need to be monitored so that the system can meet the operating requirements for the plant and so that the emission peaks and disturbances of the ESP performance can be reduced. \n\nESPs are very efficient devices for collecting ultrafine particles (<0.5 um), providing the particles have the ability to agglomerate, e.g. as recovery boiler dust. In kraft pulp recovery boilers, the particle size allows a good separation efficiency of the ESP. No aerosols are formed during combustion.\n\nThere are a number of special considerations to be addressed when designing and operating an ESP for use after the recovery boilers. Some of the key recommendations are: \n\navoid flat surfaces in the gas path from the boiler to the ESP to prevent dust build-up; \neach gas path should be designed to allow a portion of the gas cleaning system to be taken out of service for maintenance while the boiler is operating at a reduced load (i.e. design for 70 % of total flow through one ESP system);\nwith an increase in Dry Solids (DS) in the liquor, there is often an increase in the dust load to the ESP; \nthe pH of the dust must be kept above 8.5 to avoid sticky dust that will be difficult to remove from surfaces; \nthe gas flow distribution into each ESP must be kept as stable as possible (standard deviation of the gas flow after the first collection field should be 20 % or less);\ndue to the difficulties in removing collected dust from the collecting electrodes, the electrode height, length and total area of collecting surface per rapper must be sized appropriately; \nthe system for removing dust from the bottom of the ESP must be very robust, reliable, efficient and must not contribute to dust re-entrainment. \n\nThe performance of existing ESP installations can often be improved without the need for total replacement thereby limiting costs. Improvements to ESPs can be done by fitting more modern electrodes, installing automatic voltage controllers or upgrading the rapping systems. In addition, it may be possible to improve the gas passage through the ESP (improved gas flow distribution) or add supplementary stages. The performance of an existing ESP can be enhanced by improving the alignment of emitting electrodes with the collecting electrodes, eliminating gas sneakage around the electrodes, improving the collecting plate cleaning and ensuring that the electrical power supply is optimised. The latter may need to have the T/R set and controls changed. However, there are times when the increase in gas and dust load to the ESP or reduced allowable emissions from the plant are such that making changes to power supplies and controls will not be sufficient. In these cases, the existing ESP size would need to be increased. Only after a thorough evaluation of the existing ESP size, past performance and new performance requirements can the correct approach to upgrade the existing plant be determined.\n\nThe black liquor composition may change the ESP performance. The dust may adhere more strongly to the collecting plate. Cleaning the electrodes may need adjustment of the rapping. Modern control systems can detect this and alter the rapping for optimal performance. Also, the electrical power input will adapt to such a changing situation.\n\nThe size and electrical power consumption of ESPs increase exponentially with decreasing clean gas dust content. An ESP depends on defined raw gas conditions, such as temperature and humidity, for optimum operation. The lifetime of an ESP can be several decades, providing all recommended maintenance is properly carried out. Some parts, such as hammers and bearings, need regular replacement after a few years of operation as part of routine maintenance.\n\nThe ESP performance is often impacted by dust composition, gas flow distribution and gas volume, sneakage around the charging/collection systems, improper rapping system design, lack of advanced power supplies and controls, and general and poor maintenance of the ESP over time. Keeping the inside of the ESP clean, properly aligned and powered with the latest type of control system is needed to achieve the best possible performance. Routine inspections and scheduled maintenance of the inside of the ESP will result in reliable operation.\n\nMonitoring the power input to each section of the ESP and reacting to large variations will help to keep the unit performing well: the dust collection efficiency of the ESP is maximised when the charging of the dust particles is optimised and the T/Rs used to convert the plant alternating current to high voltage direct current are operating at peak levels. Closely monitoring the secondary voltage (kV), current (mA) and the sparks per minute (spark rate) from each T/R and addressing variations by boiler operation are needed to achieve the best possible collection of the dust. Higher levels of secondary current and lower amounts of sparking are key factors in maximising the ESP collection efficiency. For the overall performance of ESPs, it is important to avoid CO trips.\nBecause of their high efficiency, low pressure loss, high availability and energy efficiency, electrostatic precipitators became successfully established for dust collection from recovery boiler exhaust gas. The major disadvantages of ESPs are their decreased efficiency with an insulating layer and the possible build-up of material on the collection plates. \n\nNo bag filter applications for recovery boilers were reported. The nature of the dust and flue-gas composition from recovery boilers is not well-suited to the bag materials used in fabric filters. The gas temperature and moisture content are higher than most filter bags can accept. The dust is small in size and is often very sticky. This type of dust composition would be difficult to clean from the bags, resulting in a very high pressure drop across the filter. Boiler upset conditions could also result in bag damage that would require an outage to repair. \n\nCross-media effects\nElectricity consumption increases with increased removal efficiency. ESPs are designed based on the gas flow and level of removal efficiency required. The use of high frequency power supplies and advanced controllers for conventional transformer rectifiers (T/Rs) helps to keep the energy consumption to a minimum. The T/R power is the largest energy element of the ESP. However there are other items such as the rapping system, the dust removal system, the support insulator heaters/blowers, etc. that also consume energy. The higher the required removal efficiency per unit volume of gas flow, the higher the power consumption will be in the ESP. The removed dust is completely reused in the process.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable, provided that there is sufficient space.\n\nEconomics\nThe cost for the various changes is determined by the size and complexity of the existing systems.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLegal requirements, health and safety requirements for the workplace, local conditions.\n\nExample plants\nSee Figure   3 .123 and Figure   3 .126.\n\nReference literature\n, , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3967963_abstract", "x": 0.72172904, "y": 0.32238597, "title": "TUBULAR BOILER WITH INCORPORATED OVEN", "year": 2022, "text": "The invention relates to a tubular boiler with a heat exchange tube (1) with at least one helical layer situated in a heat exchange chamber (5), and which comprises a set of laterally joined spirals.

For some other mills (e.g. chemimechanical pulping), this technique could also be considered.\n\nDescription\nThe technique which is applied to reduce the poorly biodegradable organic compounds released from the bleach plant consists of an evaporation plant, a soda boiler equipped with a bag filter for dust removal and a smelt dissolver.\n\nAfter the cooking of the wood chips, some residual lignin is unavoidable. It cannot be removed by changing the cooking conditions. More extended cooking, for instance, would lower the pulp yield and lead to an unwanted decrease in the degree of polymerisation of the cellulose. Therefore, the delignification of the residual lignin needs to be carried out by selectively effective bleaching agents. The bleaching could be understood as a continuation of the digestion mainly taking place in the cooking plant. Normally, the bleaching consists of a number of stages (see Section 4.1.3.4). Between the bleaching steps, wash filters are inserted that remove the consumed chemicals and the dissolved reaction products originating from the pulp. Only those pulp mills that manufacture viscose and speciality pulp for chemical applications operate an alkaline extraction stage to continue delignification and to extract hemicellulose. After the alkaline extraction, the remaining lignin is removed by using one or more bleaching steps.\n\nThe technique is explained by use of an example, the dissolving pulp mill Lenzing AG (AT). The mill operates the bleaching sequence E - O/P - Z - P in the first line, and E/O/P - Z - P in the second line. For the symbolic shorthand used to describe the bleaching sequences please refer to Section 3.1.7. In this context only two of them are connected to the technique discussed: 'E' which stands for 'extraction stage using sodium hydroxide (NaOH)' and 'E/O/P' which means 'extraction stage using sodium hydroxide with the subsequent addition of gaseous oxygen and hydrogen peroxide solution as a reinforcing agent'. The other shorthand symbols refer to the subsequent ozone and peroxide bleaching steps.\n\nIn both lines, the alkaline extraction enhances the delignification of the remaining lignins. For viscose pulp production, aside from the low content of residual lignin, a high proportion of alpha-cellulose is necessary (a-cellulose is that part of a cellulosic material that is insoluble in a 17.5 % solution of sodium hydroxide at 20 degC under specified conditions). In order to guarantee this specified content of a-cellulose, a hot alkaline extraction is applied (and can be combined with an oxygen and peroxide treatment). The extraction dissolves not only the lignin compounds that are dissolvable in sodium hydroxide but also low molecular hemicelluloses and resin and fatty acids that are subsequently removed in the wash filters. The hot alkali extraction constitutes an important source of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load from the bleaching sequence. Because of the high content of residual lignin, the waste water from the hot alkali extraction stage is not readily biodegradable in activated sludge plants. This is why these effluents are first concentrated and then incinerated in a soda boiler (see Figure   4 .187).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.187:\tSimplified scheme of the evaporation and incineration of the EOP effluents\n\n\nThe evaporation plant concentrates the waste water of the EOP stage first to a dry solid (Dry Solids (DS)) content of around 50 % by means of a three-stage vacuum facility which is followed by a concentrator that reaches 70 % Dry Solids (DS). The concentrate is buffered in the EOP thick liquor tank, from where it is sent to the soda boiler for combustion. The Austrian example mill has recently acquired a new evaporation plant which operates with the principle of compression of exhaust vapours. The new evaporation plant concentrates 130 tonnes per hour of weak liquor (EOP effluent) to a concentration of 4.5 % Dry Solids (DS). Then, an amount of about 13 t/h of this liquor (of 4.5 % Dry Solids (DS)) is concentrated to about 49 % Dry Solids (DS), and subsequently enters a concentrator which extracts another 20 % of the water. One of the concentrators is continuously operating in a flushing mode while two other units evaporate the remaining water from the liquor. All vaporisers are plate downdraught vaporisers. The final concentration of the EOP thick liquor amounts to around 70 % Dry Solids (DS).\n\nThe organic compounds of the concentrated liquor are burnt in a soda boiler (a molten ash chamber boiler) which also converts sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). To consistently achieve the necessary combustion temperature of about 1 000 degC which guarantees the melt flow, natural gas is added as back-up fuel. At the maximum load conditions, around 1 000 Nm3 of natural gas per hour are needed. The hot flue-gas generates hot pressure steam of 90 bar and 480 degC in the boiler. The steam generator can also be fed with natural gas only, which then allows only 50 % of the normal steam generation. The current load of the soda boiler is 8.3 tonnes of thick liquor (oven dry) per hour (maximum capacity: 11.3 tonnes of thick liquor per hour). The heating areas in the boiler are cleaned regularly with steam-driven soot blowers. The carbon dioxide generated during the combustion is transferred into sodium carbonate. The concentrated EOP thick liquor is preheated to 120 degC before it enters the combustion chamber. Around 60 % of the sodium carbonate that is generated during combustion accumulates as melt at the floor of the furnace. From there, it is sent to the smelt dissolving tank. The remaining Na2CO3 is released with the flue-gas and is recovered as dust and ash at the funnels of the economisers and in the bag filter. The removed ash and dust are transferred to an ash-dissolving tank. Both the melt-dissolving tank and the ash-dissolving tank are equipped with agitators. The soda solution from the melt-dissolving tank is used for neutralising acid waste water streams from viscose production. The vapours generated in the dissolving tank area are collected and combined with the flue-gas before they enter the bag filters.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, the measured NOX emission levels of the soda boiler are as follows:\n\naround 310 mg NOX/Nm3 (periodical measurement)\t(limit value: NOX: 350 mg/Nm3);\naround 1 mg dust/Nm3 (continuously measured)\t\t(limit value: dust: 15 mg/Nm3);\naround 22 mg CO/Nm3 (continuously measured)\t\t(limit value: CO: 125 mg/Nm3).\n\nAll values refer to normal operating conditions and 5 % reference oxygen content. Virtually no SO2 emissions are measured as the fuels do not contain sulphurous components. The current limit values for the soda boiler are given in brackets. Dust, CO and O2 are measured continuously at the existing soda boiler. NOX is measured once every three years. For the recently acquired new soda boiler, the monitoring will include the continuous measurement of NOX. The low dust levels show very little variation. To avoid CO peaks, the burner is controlled for unwanted incrustation with slag twice a week during a short shutdown of the combustion. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe purpose of the evaporation and the combustion in the soda boiler is to generate steam from organic materials originating from the pulp manufacturing process and, simultaneously, eliminate a large part of the organic load from the bleach plant effluents. The soda solution that is generated in the bottom of the soda boiler is used to neutralise the acid waste water streams before biological treatment. The released emissions to air from the soda boiler consist of CO and NOX, as they occur in each combustion process. Dust emissions are very low as bag filters are used.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe soda boiler is stopped three to four times per year in order to clean the molten ash chamber. Deposits of MgO that are more difficult to melt could negatively influence the melting process. Minor local explosions occurred during the lifetime of the example boiler but could be controlled. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration of the EOP waste water is around 10 g/l. The energy consumption for currently running evaporation (three-stage vacuum facility) is about 7.6 kWhe/m3 of effluent and 130 kWhth/m3 of effluent or in total 137.6 kWh/m3 of EOP effluent. The recently acquired evaporation plant (compression of exhaust vapours) needs about 21.8 kWe/m3 of effluent and 20.2 kWhth/m3 of EOP waste water or in total 42 kWh/m3 of EOP waste water.\n\nThe consumption of fuel for 'burning' (back-up fuel) the concentrates after evaporation is around 46 kWh/m3 of thick liquor. The generated heat from the combustion of the EOP thick liquor together with the gas back-up fuel is 113 kWh/m3, achieving an efficiency of 90 %.\n\nThe soda produced is used for neutralisation of the waste water of the entire mill. It could also be commercialised. From the soda boiler, emissions to air, mainly NOX, should be considered. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique can be installed at both new and existing mills. An alternative to the combustion of the concentrates from evaporation in the soda boiler can be to deliver this material to a nearby kraft pulp mill where the concentrate can be burnt as alternative raw material (biomass and make-up NaOH) in the recovery boiler. For mills producing dissolving pulp for textile, where the effluent will mainly consist of easily biodegradable hemicellulose and short molecular cellulose, an alternative technique is to treat the effluent in a multistage biological treatment plant (combined anaerobic and aerobic treatment).\n\nEconomics\nIt is difficult to give precise cost figures for this technique. The estimated cost for a new evaporation plant for a medium size mill is EUR 16 million and for a soda boiler around EUR 18 million, which add up to around EUR 34 million for the entire piece of technical equipment. The costs could also be 30 - 50 % higher.\n\nOperating costs at the example mill with the current equipment (old evaporators and old boiler) are around EUR 4.35/m3 of effluent and with old evaporators and a new boiler EUR 2.7/m3 of effluent. The new evaporators will lower the operational costs. These cost data should be understood as a very rough approximation of the real costs which depend on the specific technical characteristics of the given mill.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe environmental legislation for sulphite pulp mills regarding releases of organic substances to water bodies is a major driving force for the implementation of this technique. The example mill discharges to a sensitive water body. The authorised limit values for the organic load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/day) that is discharged to the river is relatively strict and necessitates additional measures in the existing activated sludge treatment plant. The mill operators regard this measure as an important method to reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) to the receiving body of water.\n\nExample plants\nLenzing AG (AT), Tembec Tartas (FR), Borregaard (Nitric Oxide (NO)).\n\nReference literature\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4092320_abstract", "x": 0.6474698, "y": 0.26686552, "title": "BALE BOILER APPARATUS AND METHOD", "year": 2022, "text": "A bale boiler incinerates bales of material, and particularly bales made from waste, garbage and other refuse, in order to provide heat for a steam turbine generator, and includes a conveyor for transporting bales of waste material through a three-stage boiler.

The final concentration of the EOP thick liquor amounts to around 70 % Dry Solids (DS).\n\nThe organic compounds of the concentrated liquor are burnt in a soda boiler (a molten ash chamber boiler) which also converts sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). To consistently achieve the necessary combustion temperature of about 1 000 degC which guarantees the melt flow, natural gas is added as back-up fuel. At the maximum load conditions, around 1 000 Nm3 of natural gas per hour are needed. The hot flue-gas generates hot pressure steam of 90 bar and 480 degC in the boiler. The steam generator can also be fed with natural gas only, which then allows only 50 % of the normal steam generation. The current load of the soda boiler is 8.3 tonnes of thick liquor (oven dry) per hour (maximum capacity: 11.3 tonnes of thick liquor per hour). The heating areas in the boiler are cleaned regularly with steam-driven soot blowers. The carbon dioxide generated during the combustion is transferred into sodium carbonate. The concentrated EOP thick liquor is preheated to 120 degC before it enters the combustion chamber. Around 60 % of the sodium carbonate that is generated during combustion accumulates as melt at the floor of the furnace. From there, it is sent to the smelt dissolving tank. The remaining Na2CO3 is released with the flue-gas and is recovered as dust and ash at the funnels of the economisers and in the bag filter. The removed ash and dust are transferred to an ash-dissolving tank. Both the melt-dissolving tank and the ash-dissolving tank are equipped with agitators. The soda solution from the melt-dissolving tank is used for neutralising acid waste water streams from viscose production. The vapours generated in the dissolving tank area are collected and combined with the flue-gas before they enter the bag filters.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, the measured NOX emission levels of the soda boiler are as follows:\n\naround 310 mg NOX/Nm3 (periodical measurement)\t(limit value: NOX: 350 mg/Nm3);\naround 1 mg dust/Nm3 (continuously measured)\t\t(limit value: dust: 15 mg/Nm3);\naround 22 mg CO/Nm3 (continuously measured)\t\t(limit value: CO: 125 mg/Nm3).\n\nAll values refer to normal operating conditions and 5 % reference oxygen content. Virtually no SO2 emissions are measured as the fuels do not contain sulphurous components. The current limit values for the soda boiler are given in brackets. Dust, CO and O2 are measured continuously at the existing soda boiler. NOX is measured once every three years. For the recently acquired new soda boiler, the monitoring will include the continuous measurement of NOX. The low dust levels show very little variation. To avoid CO peaks, the burner is controlled for unwanted incrustation with slag twice a week during a short shutdown of the combustion. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe purpose of the evaporation and the combustion in the soda boiler is to generate steam from organic materials originating from the pulp manufacturing process and, simultaneously, eliminate a large part of the organic load from the bleach plant effluents. The soda solution that is generated in the bottom of the soda boiler is used to neutralise the acid waste water streams before biological treatment. The released emissions to air from the soda boiler consist of CO and NOX, as they occur in each combustion process. Dust emissions are very low as bag filters are used.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe soda boiler is stopped three to four times per year in order to clean the molten ash chamber. Deposits of MgO that are more difficult to melt could negatively influence the melting process. Minor local explosions occurred during the lifetime of the example boiler but could be controlled. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration of the EOP waste water is around 10 g/l. The energy consumption for currently running evaporation (three-stage vacuum facility) is about 7.6 kWhe/m3 of effluent and 130 kWhth/m3 of effluent or in total 137.6 kWh/m3 of EOP effluent. The recently acquired evaporation plant (compression of exhaust vapours) needs about 21.8 kWe/m3 of effluent and 20.2 kWhth/m3 of EOP waste water or in total 42 kWh/m3 of EOP waste water.\n\nThe consumption of fuel for 'burning' (back-up fuel) the concentrates after evaporation is around 46 kWh/m3 of thick liquor. The generated heat from the combustion of the EOP thick liquor together with the gas back-up fuel is 113 kWh/m3, achieving an efficiency of 90 %.\n\nThe soda produced is used for neutralisation of the waste water of the entire mill. It could also be commercialised. From the soda boiler, emissions to air, mainly NOX, should be considered. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique can be installed at both new and existing mills. An alternative to the combustion of the concentrates from evaporation in the soda boiler can be to deliver this material to a nearby kraft pulp mill where the concentrate can be burnt as alternative raw material (biomass and make-up NaOH) in the recovery boiler. For mills producing dissolving pulp for textile, where the effluent will mainly consist of easily biodegradable hemicellulose and short molecular cellulose, an alternative technique is to treat the effluent in a multistage biological treatment plant (combined anaerobic and aerobic treatment).\n\nEconomics\nIt is difficult to give precise cost figures for this technique. The estimated cost for a new evaporation plant for a medium size mill is EUR 16 million and for a soda boiler around EUR 18 million, which add up to around EUR 34 million for the entire piece of technical equipment. The costs could also be 30 - 50 % higher.\n\nOperating costs at the example mill with the current equipment (old evaporators and old boiler) are around EUR 4.35/m3 of effluent and with old evaporators and a new boiler EUR 2.7/m3 of effluent. The new evaporators will lower the operational costs. These cost data should be understood as a very rough approximation of the real costs which depend on the specific technical characteristics of the given mill.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe environmental legislation for sulphite pulp mills regarding releases of organic substances to water bodies is a major driving force for the implementation of this technique. The example mill discharges to a sensitive water body. The authorised limit values for the organic load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/day) that is discharged to the river is relatively strict and necessitates additional measures in the existing activated sludge treatment plant. The mill operators regard this measure as an important method to reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) to the receiving body of water.\n\nExample plants\nLenzing AG (AT), Tembec Tartas (FR), Borregaard (Nitric Oxide (NO)).\n\nReference literature\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2982655_abstract", "x": 0.56517017, "y": 0.28225443, "title": "METHOD FOR REMOVING SCALES IN STEAM GENERATION FACILITY", "year": 2016, "text": "Provided is a method for removing a scale in a steam generation facility, whereby it becomes possible to remove a scale deposited on the inside of a boiler vessel during the operation of a boiler without causing corrosion of the boiler.

For some other mills (e.g. chemimechanical pulping), this technique could also be considered.\n\nDescription\nThe technique which is applied to reduce the poorly biodegradable organic compounds released from the bleach plant consists of an evaporation plant, a soda boiler equipped with a bag filter for dust removal and a smelt dissolver.\n\nAfter the cooking of the wood chips, some residual lignin is unavoidable. It cannot be removed by changing the cooking conditions. More extended cooking, for instance, would lower the pulp yield and lead to an unwanted decrease in the degree of polymerisation of the cellulose. Therefore, the delignification of the residual lignin needs to be carried out by selectively effective bleaching agents. The bleaching could be understood as a continuation of the digestion mainly taking place in the cooking plant. Normally, the bleaching consists of a number of stages (see Section 4.1.3.4). Between the bleaching steps, wash filters are inserted that remove the consumed chemicals and the dissolved reaction products originating from the pulp. Only those pulp mills that manufacture viscose and speciality pulp for chemical applications operate an alkaline extraction stage to continue delignification and to extract hemicellulose. After the alkaline extraction, the remaining lignin is removed by using one or more bleaching steps.\n\nThe technique is explained by use of an example, the dissolving pulp mill Lenzing AG (AT). The mill operates the bleaching sequence E - O/P - Z - P in the first line, and E/O/P - Z - P in the second line. For the symbolic shorthand used to describe the bleaching sequences please refer to Section 3.1.7. In this context only two of them are connected to the technique discussed: 'E' which stands for 'extraction stage using sodium hydroxide (NaOH)' and 'E/O/P' which means 'extraction stage using sodium hydroxide with the subsequent addition of gaseous oxygen and hydrogen peroxide solution as a reinforcing agent'. The other shorthand symbols refer to the subsequent ozone and peroxide bleaching steps.\n\nIn both lines, the alkaline extraction enhances the delignification of the remaining lignins. For viscose pulp production, aside from the low content of residual lignin, a high proportion of alpha-cellulose is necessary (a-cellulose is that part of a cellulosic material that is insoluble in a 17.5 % solution of sodium hydroxide at 20 degC under specified conditions). In order to guarantee this specified content of a-cellulose, a hot alkaline extraction is applied (and can be combined with an oxygen and peroxide treatment). The extraction dissolves not only the lignin compounds that are dissolvable in sodium hydroxide but also low molecular hemicelluloses and resin and fatty acids that are subsequently removed in the wash filters. The hot alkali extraction constitutes an important source of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load from the bleaching sequence. Because of the high content of residual lignin, the waste water from the hot alkali extraction stage is not readily biodegradable in activated sludge plants. This is why these effluents are first concentrated and then incinerated in a soda boiler (see Figure   4 .187).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.187:\tSimplified scheme of the evaporation and incineration of the EOP effluents\n\n\nThe evaporation plant concentrates the waste water of the EOP stage first to a dry solid (Dry Solids (DS)) content of around 50 % by means of a three-stage vacuum facility which is followed by a concentrator that reaches 70 % Dry Solids (DS). The concentrate is buffered in the EOP thick liquor tank, from where it is sent to the soda boiler for combustion. The Austrian example mill has recently acquired a new evaporation plant which operates with the principle of compression of exhaust vapours. The new evaporation plant concentrates 130 tonnes per hour of weak liquor (EOP effluent) to a concentration of 4.5 % Dry Solids (DS). Then, an amount of about 13 t/h of this liquor (of 4.5 % Dry Solids (DS)) is concentrated to about 49 % Dry Solids (DS), and subsequently enters a concentrator which extracts another 20 % of the water.

For some other mills (e.g. chemimechanical pulping), this technique could also be considered.\n\nDescription\nThe technique which is applied to reduce the poorly biodegradable organic compounds released from the bleach plant consists of an evaporation plant, a soda boiler equipped with a bag filter for dust removal and a smelt dissolver.\n\nAfter the cooking of the wood chips, some residual lignin is unavoidable. It cannot be removed by changing the cooking conditions. More extended cooking, for instance, would lower the pulp yield and lead to an unwanted decrease in the degree of polymerisation of the cellulose. Therefore, the delignification of the residual lignin needs to be carried out by selectively effective bleaching agents. The bleaching could be understood as a continuation of the digestion mainly taking place in the cooking plant. Normally, the bleaching consists of a number of stages (see Section 4.1.3.4). Between the bleaching steps, wash filters are inserted that remove the consumed chemicals and the dissolved reaction products originating from the pulp. Only those pulp mills that manufacture viscose and speciality pulp for chemical applications operate an alkaline extraction stage to continue delignification and to extract hemicellulose. After the alkaline extraction, the remaining lignin is removed by using one or more bleaching steps.\n\nThe technique is explained by use of an example, the dissolving pulp mill Lenzing AG (AT). The mill operates the bleaching sequence E - O/P - Z - P in the first line, and E/O/P - Z - P in the second line. For the symbolic shorthand used to describe the bleaching sequences please refer to Section 3.1.7. In this context only two of them are connected to the technique discussed: 'E' which stands for 'extraction stage using sodium hydroxide (NaOH)' and 'E/O/P' which means 'extraction stage using sodium hydroxide with the subsequent addition of gaseous oxygen and hydrogen peroxide solution as a reinforcing agent'. The other shorthand symbols refer to the subsequent ozone and peroxide bleaching steps.\n\nIn both lines, the alkaline extraction enhances the delignification of the remaining lignins. For viscose pulp production, aside from the low content of residual lignin, a high proportion of alpha-cellulose is necessary (a-cellulose is that part of a cellulosic material that is insoluble in a 17.5 % solution of sodium hydroxide at 20 degC under specified conditions). In order to guarantee this specified content of a-cellulose, a hot alkaline extraction is applied (and can be combined with an oxygen and peroxide treatment). The extraction dissolves not only the lignin compounds that are dissolvable in sodium hydroxide but also low molecular hemicelluloses and resin and fatty acids that are subsequently removed in the wash filters. The hot alkali extraction constitutes an important source of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load from the bleaching sequence. Because of the high content of residual lignin, the waste water from the hot alkali extraction stage is not readily biodegradable in activated sludge plants. This is why these effluents are first concentrated and then incinerated in a soda boiler (see Figure   4 .187).\n\n\n\nFigure 4.187:\tSimplified scheme of the evaporation and incineration of the EOP effluents\n\n\nThe evaporation plant concentrates the waste water of the EOP stage first to a dry solid (Dry Solids (DS)) content of around 50 % by means of a three-stage vacuum facility which is followed by a concentrator that reaches 70 % Dry Solids (DS). The concentrate is buffered in the EOP thick liquor tank, from where it is sent to the soda boiler for combustion. The Austrian example mill has recently acquired a new evaporation plant which operates with the principle of compression of exhaust vapours. The new evaporation plant concentrates 130 tonnes per hour of weak liquor (EOP effluent) to a concentration of 4.5 % Dry Solids (DS). Then, an amount of about 13 t/h of this liquor (of 4.5 % Dry Solids (DS)) is concentrated to about 49 % Dry Solids (DS), and subsequently enters a concentrator which extracts another 20 % of the water. One of the concentrators is continuously operating in a flushing mode while two other units evaporate the remaining water from the liquor. All vaporisers are plate downdraught vaporisers. The final concentration of the EOP thick liquor amounts to around 70 % Dry Solids (DS).\n\nThe organic compounds of the concentrated liquor are burnt in a soda boiler (a molten ash chamber boiler) which also converts sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). To consistently achieve the necessary combustion temperature of about 1 000 degC which guarantees the melt flow, natural gas is added as back-up fuel. At the maximum load conditions, around 1 000 Nm3 of natural gas per hour are needed. The hot flue-gas generates hot pressure steam of 90 bar and 480 degC in the boiler. The steam generator can also be fed with natural gas only, which then allows only 50 % of the normal steam generation. The current load of the soda boiler is 8.3 tonnes of thick liquor (oven dry) per hour (maximum capacity: 11.3 tonnes of thick liquor per hour). The heating areas in the boiler are cleaned regularly with steam-driven soot blowers. The carbon dioxide generated during the combustion is transferred into sodium carbonate. The concentrated EOP thick liquor is preheated to 120 degC before it enters the combustion chamber. Around 60 % of the sodium carbonate that is generated during combustion accumulates as melt at the floor of the furnace. From there, it is sent to the smelt dissolving tank. The remaining Na2CO3 is released with the flue-gas and is recovered as dust and ash at the funnels of the economisers and in the bag filter. The removed ash and dust are transferred to an ash-dissolving tank. Both the melt-dissolving tank and the ash-dissolving tank are equipped with agitators. The soda solution from the melt-dissolving tank is used for neutralising acid waste water streams from viscose production. The vapours generated in the dissolving tank area are collected and combined with the flue-gas before they enter the bag filters.\n\nUnder normal operating conditions, the measured NOX emission levels of the soda boiler are as follows:\n\naround 310 mg NOX/Nm3 (periodical measurement)\t(limit value: NOX: 350 mg/Nm3);\naround 1 mg dust/Nm3 (continuously measured)\t\t(limit value: dust: 15 mg/Nm3);\naround 22 mg CO/Nm3 (continuously measured)\t\t(limit value: CO: 125 mg/Nm3).\n\nAll values refer to normal operating conditions and 5 % reference oxygen content. Virtually no SO2 emissions are measured as the fuels do not contain sulphurous components. The current limit values for the soda boiler are given in brackets. Dust, CO and O2 are measured continuously at the existing soda boiler. NOX is measured once every three years. For the recently acquired new soda boiler, the monitoring will include the continuous measurement of NOX. The low dust levels show very little variation. To avoid CO peaks, the burner is controlled for unwanted incrustation with slag twice a week during a short shutdown of the combustion. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe purpose of the evaporation and the combustion in the soda boiler is to generate steam from organic materials originating from the pulp manufacturing process and, simultaneously, eliminate a large part of the organic load from the bleach plant effluents. The soda solution that is generated in the bottom of the soda boiler is used to neutralise the acid waste water streams before biological treatment. The released emissions to air from the soda boiler consist of CO and NOX, as they occur in each combustion process. Dust emissions are very low as bag filters are used.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe soda boiler is stopped three to four times per year in order to clean the molten ash chamber. Deposits of MgO that are more difficult to melt could negatively influence the melting process. Minor local explosions occurred during the lifetime of the example boiler but could be controlled. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration of the EOP waste water is around 10 g/l. The energy consumption for currently running evaporation (three-stage vacuum facility) is about 7.6 kWhe/m3 of effluent and 130 kWhth/m3 of effluent or in total 137.6 kWh/m3 of EOP effluent. The recently acquired evaporation plant (compression of exhaust vapours) needs about 21.8 kWe/m3 of effluent and 20.2 kWhth/m3 of EOP waste water or in total 42 kWh/m3 of EOP waste water.\n\nThe consumption of fuel for 'burning' (back-up fuel) the concentrates after evaporation is around 46 kWh/m3 of thick liquor. The generated heat from the combustion of the EOP thick liquor together with the gas back-up fuel is 113 kWh/m3, achieving an efficiency of 90 %.\n\nThe soda produced is used for neutralisation of the waste water of the entire mill. It could also be commercialised. From the soda boiler, emissions to air, mainly NOX, should be considered. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique can be installed at both new and existing mills. An alternative to the combustion of the concentrates from evaporation in the soda boiler can be to deliver this material to a nearby kraft pulp mill where the concentrate can be burnt as alternative raw material (biomass and make-up NaOH) in the recovery boiler. For mills producing dissolving pulp for textile, where the effluent will mainly consist of easily biodegradable hemicellulose and short molecular cellulose, an alternative technique is to treat the effluent in a multistage biological treatment plant (combined anaerobic and aerobic treatment).\n\nEconomics\nIt is difficult to give precise cost figures for this technique. The estimated cost for a new evaporation plant for a medium size mill is EUR 16 million and for a soda boiler around EUR 18 million, which add up to around EUR 34 million for the entire piece of technical equipment. The costs could also be 30 - 50 % higher.\n\nOperating costs at the example mill with the current equipment (old evaporators and old boiler) are around EUR 4.35/m3 of effluent and with old evaporators and a new boiler EUR 2.7/m3 of effluent. The new evaporators will lower the operational costs. These cost data should be understood as a very rough approximation of the real costs which depend on the specific technical characteristics of the given mill.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe environmental legislation for sulphite pulp mills regarding releases of organic substances to water bodies is a major driving force for the implementation of this technique. The example mill discharges to a sensitive water body. The authorised limit values for the organic load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/day) that is discharged to the river is relatively strict and necessitates additional measures in the existing activated sludge treatment plant. The mill operators regard this measure as an important method to reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) to the receiving body of water.\n\nExample plants\nLenzing AG (AT), Tembec Tartas (FR), Borregaard (Nitric Oxide (NO)).\n\nReference literature\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3462120_abstract", "x": 0.7609143, "y": 0.29547355, "title": "METHOD FOR DETECTING, MONITORING, AND REMOVING DEPOSITS ON BOILER HEAT EXCHANGER SURFACES USING VIBRATIONAL ANALYSIS", "year": 2019, "text": "A boiler system (10) includes a boiler (12) having at least one heat exchanger (22) having a surface (48) on which a deposit (20) may form.

The recently acquired evaporation plant (compression of exhaust vapours) needs about 21.8 kWe/m3 of effluent and 20.2 kWhth/m3 of EOP waste water or in total 42 kWh/m3 of EOP waste water.\n\nThe consumption of fuel for 'burning' (back-up fuel) the concentrates after evaporation is around 46 kWh/m3 of thick liquor. The generated heat from the combustion of the EOP thick liquor together with the gas back-up fuel is 113 kWh/m3, achieving an efficiency of 90 %.\n\nThe soda produced is used for neutralisation of the waste water of the entire mill. It could also be commercialised. From the soda boiler, emissions to air, mainly NOX, should be considered. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique can be installed at both new and existing mills. An alternative to the combustion of the concentrates from evaporation in the soda boiler can be to deliver this material to a nearby kraft pulp mill where the concentrate can be burnt as alternative raw material (biomass and make-up NaOH) in the recovery boiler. For mills producing dissolving pulp for textile, where the effluent will mainly consist of easily biodegradable hemicellulose and short molecular cellulose, an alternative technique is to treat the effluent in a multistage biological treatment plant (combined anaerobic and aerobic treatment).\n\nEconomics\nIt is difficult to give precise cost figures for this technique. The estimated cost for a new evaporation plant for a medium size mill is EUR 16 million and for a soda boiler around EUR 18 million, which add up to around EUR 34 million for the entire piece of technical equipment. The costs could also be 30 - 50 % higher.\n\nOperating costs at the example mill with the current equipment (old evaporators and old boiler) are around EUR 4.35/m3 of effluent and with old evaporators and a new boiler EUR 2.7/m3 of effluent. The new evaporators will lower the operational costs. These cost data should be understood as a very rough approximation of the real costs which depend on the specific technical characteristics of the given mill.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe environmental legislation for sulphite pulp mills regarding releases of organic substances to water bodies is a major driving force for the implementation of this technique. The example mill discharges to a sensitive water body. The authorised limit values for the organic load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/day) that is discharged to the river is relatively strict and necessitates additional measures in the existing activated sludge treatment plant. The mill operators regard this measure as an important method to reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) to the receiving body of water.\n\nExample plants\nLenzing AG (AT), Tembec Tartas (FR), Borregaard (Nitric Oxide (NO)).\n\nReference literature\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2891762_abstract", "x": 0.6406088, "y": 0.4104271, "title": "Multiple chemical supply line", "year": 2015, "text": "A method of supplying multiple chemicals in a supply line (1), wherein the chemicals are supplied as discrete slugs, i.e. not mixed in the supply line.

Each of these disposal methods has its disadvantages. The drawbacks of land-fill are self apparent. Although incineration may include energy recovery, there still remains the obvious problem of CO2 emission and the emission of other toxic pollutants.

The waste hierarchy of the Directive on waste \n provides guidance in planning for a minimum of residues to be disposed of.\n\nSome of the waste/residues that result from the production process may be regarded as not being waste according to point (1) of Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive (Waste Framework Directive (WFD)) but as being a by-product if the conditions listed in Article 5 of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD)  are met.\n\nIn order to prevent or minimise waste generation, all processes should be reviewed to identify areas where there is potential for improvement. Waste inventories allow for identifying and classifying the type, characteristics and amount of each waste fraction and show where waste originates. After collecting the waste/residue fractions at the points of origin, the waste/residue fractions are kept separate or are merged depending on the preferred options for reuse/recycling and further treatment and disposal.\n\nWaste assessment and waste management schemes/concepts are useful tools to identify feasible options for prevention, preparing for reuse, recovery, recycling and the safe disposal of waste and residues. These waste management schemes may also contribute to a high resource utilisation and improved operating economy.\n\nThe decision-making tree for waste management of paper mills shown in Figure   2 .52 outlines the general approach that the waste hierarchy follows and helps identify the possibilities for material recycling or energy recovery.\nFigure 2.52:\tPossible decision-making tree for waste management of paper mill waste\n\n\nThe residues of paper mills are mostly characterised by a relatively high amount of organic material. General possible management options to minimise waste and progressively eliminate landfilling include energy recovery in on-site incinerators or biomass power plants, energy and material recovery in other industries, such as cement, bricks, land construction, and in some cases also agricultural use providing that the composition fulfils the criteria for such use.\n\na) Prevention\nPrevention of waste primarily applies to the production process where suitable techniques should be used where possible. Examples are to minimise the amount of fibre rejects having to be removed from the process (see Section 5.3.3), suitable handling and recovery (see Section 7.3.5) to avoid having to discard coating chemicals, or using good quality make-up chemicals to reduce the amount of material having to be bled out from a kraft or sulphite recovery system.\n\nIn many cases it is not possible to prevent residues, e.g. bark and wood residues from wood handling, bale thread from pulp or recycled paper bales, biosludge or chemical sludge from effluent treatment. The amount of primary sludge, often mainly consisting of fibres and fibre fragments, can however be minimised by preventing fibre losses and fibre rejects from entering the effluent as much as possible (see Section 7.3.4).\n\nDirect reuse is most commonly applied to process equipment in the pulp and paper industry. Equipment in good condition can be reused after reconditioning and/or repair and sometimes entire paper machines, boilers, etc. are dismantled, reconditioned and brought to use in new locations.\n\nPaper trim, cuttings, off-grade pulp and other production paper residues are recycled making new products most common in the mill producing the residue or in another paper mill that uses recycled fibres.\n\nb) Material recycling\nAn overview of the main treatment options for material recycling and the factors governing the treatment options choice are shown in Figure   2 .53. Concerning transport, the principle of proximity reduces environmental impact and costs.\n\n\nFigure 2.53:\tOptions for material recycling of paper mill residues and factors governing treatment options choice\n\n\nRecycling possibilities depend on the papermaking process considered, the raw materials used and consequently the type and physico-chemical properties of the generated production residues. In some countries, composting of paper sludge or land spreading in agriculture is practised when the waste fractions are suitable for this option, e.g. composting only makes sense when the sludge is biodegradable (high amount of organic matter (fibres) compared to inorganic matter-like pigments), and spreading in agriculture depends on the amount of nutrients in the sludge and its pH-adjusting capability (pigments/fillers). \n\nFor spreading in agriculture the control of the potential pollutants is of crucial importance. Sludge from paper mills usually does not contain more pollutants than sludge from municipal treatment works and restricted application can have some positive effects on the soil (CaCO3 is a neutralising agent for acidic soils, moisture retention by fibres and fines on dry soils, low nitrogen content). The possible benefits vary according to the soil type. The periods of land spreading are restricted to certain months of the year. It is therefore necessary to ensure sufficient storage capacity for the sludge.\n\nThe feasibility of land spreading is strongly dependent on the acceptance in Member States to apply sludge to agricultural land. In some Member States this practice is authorised applying specific legal requirements for its application and especially considering soil protection; in other Member States land spreading of paper sludge is banned. The major concerns are possible contamination of soils with low concentrations of heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants, and local opposition because of nuisance problems or image problems for agricultural products from land-spreading areas.\n\nFor composting, the quality demands of the compost are most important to get a marketable product. Composts made from organic waste mixed with different quantities of paper for recycling and residues from the paper industry fulfil these requirements such as degree of maturity or suitability for plant growth. Furthermore, parameters such as salt and organic substance content and the process-specific leachate emission are positively influenced. The concentration of harmful substances, especially those containing heavy metals, must be considered a limiting factor.\n\nAnother option for material recycling of sludge from paper mills is the utilisation in the cement and brick industry (to improve porosity) or as another building material. In the cement industry both the material and energy content of the paper residues can be recovered. For use in the cement industry, sludge from primary clarifiers (or mixed with excess sludge from biological treatment) that contains fibres, fines and inorganic compounds (e.g. fillers, coating pigments) is especially suitable. The sludge (about 50 % moisture content) is dried with waste heat from the pre-dryer of the cement kiln so that no additional thermal energy is needed to reduce the moisture of the sludge down to 10 - 15 %. Thus, when burning the dried sludge in the cement rotary kiln the calorific value of the organic substances is used and the ash from incineration of the sludge (mainly) remains in the product (cement). The inorganic substance of the ash of the incinerated sludge is also a compound of the cement clinker. If cement (or brick) manufacturing industries are close to the mill and are able to use the sludge it is a viable option. It has also been reported that fibrous sludges mixed with fly ash have been used for construction purposes, e.g. roads and storage fields.\n\nThe inorganic waste fractions (sand, stones, grit, ashes, lime) can often be used for construction like paving, roads, covering layers, etc. Using best available techniques, only a small fraction of the original amount of the residues have no economic use and will have to be brought to waste disposal. Before disposal, in some cases, the given waste fraction requires pretreatment in order to achieve the legal limits of the organic content of the material to be disposed of.\n\nc) Energy recovery\nThe majority of the organic waste and residues from the production of pulp and paper (bark, wood residues, residual fibres) can be recovered and incinerated on site to generate heat. Energy recovery off site (e.g. dried bark) or in other industries such as the cement and bricks industry are other possible treatment options. Bark and wood residues from wood handling are a carbon-neutral fuel. In order to obtain a high level of energy efficiency the bark should be as dry as possible before incineration, which can be achieved by drying the bark (in hot climates in wet seasons). Wood ash from bark boilers contains nutrients from the forest. This ash can be suitable as a fertiliser if transportation and spreading can be efficiently arranged and if the ash is not contaminated, e.g. by high metals content.\n\nUsually fluidised bed boilers or multiple-hearth furnaces are used to burn the organic residues from the paper industry. These installations achieve the legal requirements for incineration when appropriate air emission abatement is applied (see Section 2.9.7). For further information regarding incineration of rejects and sludge from processing paper for recycling the reader is referred to Section 6.3.14 of this document.\n\nCo-incineration of paper industry waste and residues in other industries is practised in cement kilns, incinerators for municipal waste, blast furnaces (iron and steel industry) and cupola furnaces (foundries). For this option, waste and residues with a high calorific value are especially suitable to replace fossil fuel (e.g. coal, fuel oil). The paper mill residues are usually mixed with other fuels burnt in these installations. Before incineration, they have to be dewatered and sometimes also dried (e.g. for cement, and iron and steel industry). The homogeneity of secondary fuel and uniform and constant composition of the residues are also important.\n\nThe combustion behaviour of paper mill waste and residues such as deinking sludge, rejects from cleaning and screening, or sludge from waste water treatment is shown in Figure   2 .54. It illustrates the connection between combustible/organic content, ash content and water content.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.54:\tFuel triangle for waste and residues from the paper industry (provided by IFP)\n\n\nThe area where dewatered deinking sludge and dewatered rejects from mechanical cleaning and screening are located is plotted hatched. It shows that self-supporting combustion where no additional fuels are necessary can be achieved for both: (i) rejects with relatively high calorific values and (ii) deinking sludge with a relatively high ash content. Sludge from effluent treatment can also be burnt but the net energy production is zero or negative if the dry solids (Dry Solids (DS)) content in the sludge is below about 40 % and/or the sludge contains a high amount of inorganic material. Under such conditions, the use of auxiliary fuel is necessary, preferably bark and other wood waste material. Burning reduces the volume of waste and the inorganic content remains as ash which is landfilled or further used in the building industry. \n\nSludge from chemical precipitation cannot be burnt alone without the use of auxiliary fuel due to the high content of inorganic matter and water. Still, such sludge is sometimes burnt to minimise the volume sent to landfill. Methods to recover precipitation chemicals are being explored but must still be considered under development. Sludge from flocculation with only synthetic organic polyelectrolytes is suitable for incineration.\n\nThe effect of co-incineration of paper mill waste and residues and sludge on air emissions depends on the composition of the burnt material. Co-incineration of fibre and paper sludge - especially those with high alkali content - in coal- or lignite-fired power plants has either no effect on air emissions or leads to a slight reduction of pollutants. Emissions of SO2, HCl and HF are reduced by co-incineration of sludge with high alkali content (deinking sludge, fibre sludge containing coating pigments and filler). The content of heavy metals in fibre and paper sludge is also low compared to coal and lignite. Rejects from stock preparation of paper for recycling in mills manufacturing corrugating material have a higher chlorine content (1 - 3 % mass). Experience shows that co-incineration of rejects, e.g. in lignite-fired power plants, is feasible without increasing dioxin emissions (see Section 6.3.14).\n\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe measures protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the adverse effects of the generation and management of waste and by reducing the overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTypical ranges for the amount of residue that is brought to solid waste disposal are compiled in Table   2 .35 for different types of pulp and paper production. The table represents the situation in 2009 in Swedish mills which have taken ambitious measures to minimise residues.\n\n\nTable 2.35:\tTypical ranges of solid residues (wet weight) sent to disposal from different types of pulp and paper production\n\n\nThe table shows that, for all types of production, very low amounts of residues being sent to disposal can be achieved. \n\nThe ranges also indicate that mills producing kraft pulp tend to have higher amounts of residues being sent to disposal than those based on sulphite or mechanical pulp. This is because of the necessary purge of impurities from the recovery area of kraft mills (green liquor sludge, grits and other inorganic material). Non-integrated production of paper normally results in very low amounts of solid residues being sent to disposal. Further examples are presented in the process-specific Chapters 3 to 7.\n\nIt may not be possible for mills to always reach the low amounts of residues sent to disposal indicated by the lower end of the ranges shown in the Table   2 .35. Important prerequisites are well-functioning systems to minimise process residues and sorting residues according to the intended further treatment. Another prerequisite is that there must be a use for the residue either in the mill or externally. \n\nResidues which are typically difficult to eliminate and find uses for include green liquor sludge from the kraft recovery process, ash from boilers, and the mix of sand, stones, bark and wood fragments that originate from the wood handling. In many cases, such materials can be used as construction material in finalising landfills or in road construction. The mix of sand, bark and wood fragments may be used in soil improvement after adding nutrients for example. Trials have been under way for some time to use ash to recycle nutrients and trace metals to forests. There are also companies specialised in handling and upgrading such material for more diverse uses.\n\nMills reporting zero or almost no residues sent to disposal have been able to develop these end-users, at least for periods of time. Since the demand from the end-users may vary, this may not be possible at all times and thus it is important for almost all types of pulp and paper mills to have a safe and sufficient disposal site available.\n\nTable   2 .36 shows two examples of mills that have been able to reduce the amount of residues sent to disposal to low levels. Mill A is a non-integrated paper mill and Mill B is an integrated kraft mill producing printing and writing papers and market pulp. \n\n\nTable 2.36:\tTwo examples of mills with low levels of residues sent to final disposal\n\n\nIndustry-specific residue is bark, wood residue, ash, green liquor sludge, etc. and is used for material recycling or energy recovery. In the case of the kraft pulp and paper mill, virtually all of the bark and wood residues are used in the bark boiler. The hazardous waste is in both cases handled by certified organisations ('other recycling') and developed for other uses or safe disposal. As a result of the waste management applied, the amount of residue sent to disposal from the paper mill is close to zero. The residue sent to disposal from the kraft mill is mainly green liquor sludge which might be used as a covering layer on a solid waste disposal.\n\nCross-media effects\nReduced quantity of residues and consequently raw material consumption and associated costs. Waste is used and its pollution potential reduced. Furthermore, the process efficiency and process economy are improved.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to all mills. Potential for recycling may depend on the papermaking process and the raw materials used (depending on which paper product is produced). For example, the option of composting paper sludge depends on the biodegradation of the sludge (the amount of organic matter-like fibre versus inorganic matter-like pigments). Spreading in agriculture depends on the amount of nutrients in the sludge (raw materials) and its pH-adjusting capability (pigments/fillers).\n\nEconomics\nThe application of the waste hierarchy provides for use of resources with high economic efficiency, particularly to prevent the formation of residues by applying cleaner technologies.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nPrevention of or preparation for reuse, recycling and recovery of process residues have economic benefits as they allow better use of resources and higher economic efficiency. The recovery of energy by incineration of residual material is vital to increase value and minimise final volumes sent to disposal. EU and national waste legislation are other driving forces. There are two EU Directives of prime importance for the handling of residues from the pulp and paper industry: the Waste Framework Directive and the Waste Incineration Directive.\n\nThe Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC  provides definitions, encourages waste management plans and promotes the waste hierarchy which shall apply in order of priority in waste prevention and waste management: prevention, preparing for reuse, recycling, other recovery, e.g. energy recovery, and finally disposal. When this course of action is fully applied, any residual waste should be recycled, recovered as a raw material, a source of energy or, as a last possibility, should be safely disposed of.\n\nThe Waste Incineration Directive  regulates the permit requirements for incineration and co-incineration plants, and sets emission limits and monitoring requirements for certain pollutants released to air or to water. The Directive also applies to 'co-incineration' plants (facilities whose main purpose is to produce energy or material products and which use waste as a regular or additional fuel, this waste being thermally treated for the purpose of disposal). According to Article 2 (2) of the Directive, combustion plants treating only 'fibrous vegetable waste from virgin pulp production and from production of paper from pulp' or 'wood waste' are not covered. For the description of best available techniques for waste incineration, the reader is also referred to the Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for Waste Incineration .\n\nExample plants\nMany pulp and paper mills in Europe have implemented waste management plans or integrated waste management concepts. All mills try to minimise the amount of solid waste to be disposed of.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n, , [ Swedish Forest Industry Federation, 2008 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3756776_abstract", "x": 0.5765774, "y": 0.27354002, "title": "USE OF FLY ASH AND AIR POLLUTION CONTROL RESIDUES (APCRS) FOR THE TREATMENT OF PER- AND POLY-FLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES (PFASS) IN CONTAMINATED SOIL", "year": 2020, "text": "Fly ash or Air Pollution Control Residue, APCR, may be mixed with PFAS contaminated soil to immobilize PFAS in the soil.

Natural soil functions should be safeguarded, if feasible.\nUse a monitoring programme that is especially relative to groundwater in order to detect possible future impacts on site or in the neighbouring areas.\nDraft a decommissioning scheme that includes the transparent organisation of the shutdown works taking into account specific relevant, local conditions. This decommissioning plan may facilitate action and communication as the availability of information will generally decrease since the staff responsible for environmental matters may have left the closed company.\n\nThe operators of the pulp or paper mill should guarantee that the necessary activities during the decommissioning of the plant be supported by technically trained staff. A prerequisite for a smooth decommissioning is a good relationship with the competent authority based on regular meetings and open discussions during the period of operation.\n\nSite reports are a measure that, at the earliest opportunity, allow for establishing a baseline from which further site contamination can be assessed. This baseline report can then be compared to later reports when the installation is sold, closed or redeveloped. The baseline report can also be used to prioritise action to be taken at the installation.\n\nActions to be taken are specific to individual sites and the pulp or paper grade manufactured. For new plants, decommissioning should be considered at the design stage, thereby minimising risks and excessive costs during later decommissioning. The design of planned installations may include:\n\nensuring that the provision for the draining and cleaning-out of vessels and pipework prior to dismantling is incorporated in the design;\ndesigning aerated lagoons and landfills with a view to their eventual clean-up or cessation; risk assessment may be a useful tool to evaluate the specific requirements;\ngiving recyclable materials priority.\n\nThe initial state of a site should be assessed before building a new plant.\n\nFor existing installations, a general site closure or cessation scheme should be developed and maintained. The scheme will also take into account the utilisation purpose of the site in question. The individual plan and goals for the decommissioning are based on a risk analysis. The cessation scheme should be completed before the real shutdown plan, to demonstrate that the installation can be decommissioned avoiding any pollution risk and returning the site of operation to a satisfactory state. According to this programme, the potential environmental problems should be addressed and measures for improvements of its state proposed. The programme should be kept updated when relevant material changes occur. \nThe programme for cessation of activities may also include the following actions:\n\nif underground tanks and pipework are installed in installations, they should be equipped with the proper system for cleaning up and emptying them;\nnecessary measures to restore aerated lagoons to a satisfactory state;\nforeseeable measures for restoring on-site landfills to a state that enable cessation in accordance with environmental regulations;\nmeasures ensuring that insulation will be dismantled without dust or hazards arising;\nmeasures for the removal or the flushing out of pipelines and vessels where appropriate and completely emptying any potentially harmful contents;\nthe closure programme should develop a number of plans and methods for analysing the possible concerns, e.g.:\nspecifications for all underground pipes and vessels;\nthe method and resources necessary for restoring aerated lagoons to a satisfactory state on the basis of a risk assessment;\nmethods for redesigning and modifying the waste water treatment plant for a reduced waste water charge;\nthe method of ensuring that any on-site landfills cause no risk after cessation of the activities;\nmethods of dismantling buildings and other structures to prevent dust and for the protection of soil and surface and groundwater at construction and demolition sites;\ntesting of the soil to ascertain the degree of pollution caused by the activities and the need for remediation to return the site to a satisfactory state as defined by the initial site report.\n\nIf the soils of a site are ever severely contaminated, measures may include intermediate soil coverage, leachate collection and treatment, removal of contaminated earth and the provision of geological barriers.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThere is little public documented information on the closure of pulp and paper mills. Some experience has been gathered that can be used as a general checklist of issues that operators and authorities may face in the case of pulp or paper mill closures. \n\nOne practical experience is described in an 'Inquiry of measures related to closing down pulp and paper mills' carried out by the Southeast Finland Regional Environment Centre in 2009. The inquiry concerned measures related to the closing-down of seven pulp or paper mills in Finland and it was sent to both environmental authorities and Finnish Forest Industries Federation. In the project, information was received from replies to the inquiry and from the documents related to the decommissioning of the plants. The answers from seven companies, four environment centres, and the Finnish Forest Industries Federation indicated the items listed below.\n\nThere are no exceptional waste water emissions during the shutdown of a waste water treatment plant or afterwards. In the case of external treatment of the paper mill waste water or common treatment with municipal waste water, the cessation of activities may cause problems when the incoming loads change drastically. The waste water treatment plant would then need some modifications.\nThe treatment of sludge of mills still operating may raise difficulties if the sludge has previously been burnt in an auxiliary boiler of the closed mill. The accumulated sludge may cause nuisances and the waste management must be organised in a satisfactory way.\nWaste from demolition work may form a significant waste fraction, which can be recycled, taken to a landfill and/or partially sent to the municipal waste treatment facilities. Problems may also emerge if there is no space in the landfill, and the environmental permit does not allow the use of closed landfills.\nAfter closing a company-owned landfill, a number of measures are necessary such as investigations of the soil, leakage, gas production, restoration measures, treatment of run-off waters and gases, quality assurance and monitoring. These activities are part of the requirements of the landfill permit. The possible risk of contaminated land can be investigated by taking samplings based on a risk assessment and the historical information of the site and the company. The plan and the environmental permit application concerning the treatment of contaminated lands are made based on the sampling results. The investigation should be included in the shutdown plan, a plan that is normally made after the decision to cease activities. The mills that are still in operation do not possess such plans. In some cases, it has been difficult to find out where the contaminated lands are actually located. With a lack of historical information, there may be uncertainty about the location of the restored and contaminated lands and who is responsible for restoring the area.\nThe use and treatment of the remaining raw materials and semi-finished products have been organised according to the plan for the cessation of the activities that has been prepared after the declaration of decommissioning. Usable chemicals, batches of pulp, timber, etc. can be transported to the other mills of the companies. The material unfit for use is treated as waste or hazardous waste. \nDemolition work causes increased transport and noise. The organisation of the workplace for the demolition of the plant requires surveillance and specific agreements. The absence of a valid permit for the disposal of demolition waste can also be a problem. Asbestos waste requires specific measures.\nIn one case, significant odour nuisances have been reported caused by an aerated lagoon where waste water was led during shutdown and that was left without maintenance. Now there is aeration in the lagoon to prevent the nuisance. A year after the shutdown, the odour was no longer noticed. Negative impacts can be avoided by restoring these kinds of ponds to a satisfactory state.\nAfter the cessation of activities, the supervision and monitoring of water bodies should be continued for years to investigate the effect of the reduction of discharged pollutant load to water bodies. Additionally, monitoring the run-off waters from landfills should be continued for many years. In order to accomplish the decommissioning activities, i.e. the measures carried out on-site after the shutdown of the mill (e.g. the dismantling of buildings and restoration of contaminated lands) supervision from the competent authorities is needed. The monitoring frequency must correlate with the risks and emissions, and time intervals for analysis should be established so that the results can be used for the monitoring of change. \n\nAll these examples are from mills where the decommissioning process is still on-going and the final decisions by the competent authorities might deviate from the opinions given in the interviews/inquiry. The result of ongoing analyses of soil as well as of former waste water recipients, etc. will influence the perceived need for further treatment.\n\nThe main experience gathered during personal interviews conducted with representatives of Swedish mills that have been shut down  are highlighted below.\n\nA prerequisite for a smooth decommissioning is a good relationship with the competent authority based on regular meetings and open discussions during the period of operation.\nThe authorities have been informed and involved from the time the decision is made known to the public and the employees.\nEach closing is unique but common for all is that the basic procedure is identical to a normal maintenance shutdown but modified due to the fact that all tanks have to be emptied, i.e. do not need any liquors for start-up.\nWith good planning, very few chemicals and intermediates are left and those quantities can be sold/delivered to other mills still in operation.\nIt is common that some parts (wood yard, bark boiler) of the mill are taken over by a new operator which makes some kind of documentation of the historical responsibility, e.g. soil for contamination, necessary. Usually this documentation also involves legal assistance.\nIf demolition work is going to take place, i.e. no continuation of some sort of activities in existing buildings, it is very important to choose an experienced contractor to minimise risks and to accomplish an open dialogue with the authorities. Many times the contractors take on the responsibility of sorting the demolished material, sending what is possible for recycling, etc.\nSince all sites concerned have been utilised for industrial activities for more than 100 years, the most time-consuming issue has been the possible historical contamination of the soil. Sweden has an ongoing national programme to develop an inventory of all contaminated land areas. All three mills had, already before the closure decision, finalised Stage 1 in this inventory that includes the tracking of historical activities but still no drilling and sampling. After the closing decision, the results from Stage 1 were used as background material to decide, together with the competent authorities, on the location and number of drilling holes. The samples were/will be analysed for different components depending on the historical activity.\nSo far no major surprises have emerged and no demands for the treatment of contaminated land have been made. Because the sites have been under different ownership over time, there is often a need for legal investigations regarding responsibility.\nThere are different experiences when it comes to demands on the future monitoring of recipients but common for all is that no final decisions have been made.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique has only positive effects, preventing or reducing the pollution of all media. Possible pollution caused by the contaminated soil or sludge needs to be evaluated, prevented or reduced.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nFor new plants, decommissioning should be considered at the design stage to prevent contamination. For example, the UK Environment Agency requires operators to submit a decommissioning plan to supplement their permits. \n\nFor existing installations, the operator should produce a general scheme related to the cessation of activities as part of an environmental improvement programme.\n\nWhen a decision to close the mill has been taken, a shutdown plan should be agreed upon in cooperation with the competent authorities. The main reason for not issuing a closure plan for an existing mill in advance is that the plan should consider all relevant information (analytical methods, sanitation techniques, etc.) available at the time of the decision and not be based only on older facts.\n\nEconomics\nThe costs of the described measures have not been reported but they can be quite substantial. Cost also depends on the need for the mentioned activities that are assessed by the competent authorities. The costs of the preventive measures described in the text have also not been reported but they can possibly minimise excessive costs during later decommissioning.\n\nExample plants\nSeveral plants in Finland and Sweden. Even if plants have been shut down in Europe earlier, there are few recent examples (with permits according to modern legislation) where all measures have been carried out and a final agreement has been settled with the applicable competent authority. The experiences recounted under 'Environmental performance and operational data' are given for projects that are not yet finalised.\n\nReferences\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4036197_abstract", "x": 0.5496151, "y": 0.15892102, "title": "METHOD FOR REFINING OF SOAPSTOCK BY ACIDULATION AND SOLVENT EXTRACTION", "year": 2022, "text": "The invention refers to the vegetable oil processing and energy sector, in particular the obtaining of raw material for the production of biodiesel from the oil refining process waste, called soapstock (SS), that is formed after the washing of the crude oil with an aqueous alkali solution.

Dewatering is carried out by means of wire presses or screw presses. Dewatering aims at removing water from the sludge as much as possible. Different types of mechanical equipment are available for this operation:\n\nbelt presses (twin wire presses)\nscrew presses\ndecanter centrifuges.\n\nMany installations have installed belt presses which have a reliable function and produce a Dry Solids (DS) content of 40 - 50 % with fibre sludge and 25 - 40 % with mixed fibre/biological/chemical sludge.\n\nScrew presses can be used in two ways: either to increase the Dry Solids (DS) content after the belt press dewatering, by which a Dry Solids (DS) increase of approximately 10 % can be obtained; or for direct dewatering as a higher Dry Solids (DS) content can be obtained by screw presses compared to dewatering with a belt press.\n\nAfter dewatering, the sludge and rejects can be dried (see Section 2.9.6.1.4) in order to increase the heating value of the materials for energy recovery in incineration plants. Incineration further reduces the amount of wastes sent from mechanical pulping to landfill disposal and recovers the energy content of the waste fractions. Incineration of the bark is carried out in bark boilers or in co-combustion plants using mixed fuels. Particularly for rather low Dry Solids (DS) sludge, fluidised bed boilers are presently the best option (see Section 2.6.1.2.3). These fluidised bed boilers can be run with 100 % sludge although the use of a support fuel is more common (like coal or oil). The requirement for the support fuel depends on the Dry Solids (DS) and the ash content of the sludge. Generally, at least 35 - 40 % Dry Solids (DS) is required for spontaneous combustion.\n\nFor detailed discussion of incineration with energy recovery including emission control techniques, the reader is referred to Sections 2.6 and 2.9.7.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe dewatering processes have been used in many pulp and paper mills. Incineration in bark boilers and other incinerators are common techniques in the sector (see Sections 2.6.1 and 2.9.7 and 5.3.10).\n\nThe heating value of rejects and sludge and the overall burning results can be improved by applying improved dewatering equipment such as screw presses. The dryness target should be 45 %, when the ash content is below 30 % and reaching for instance 65 - 70 % at 50 % ash content. However, the sludge mix and its material characteristics may vary significantly between mills and different sludges have different dewatering characteristics. For instance, excess sludge from biological treatment has relatively poor dewatering properties (18 - 22 % Dry Solids (DS)) if not mixed with other materials; by contrast, primary sludge from primary clarifiers is easier to dewater (35 - 55 % Dry Solids (DS)) but can also be mixed with other material for better dewatering.\n\nWhen the amount of sludge is high and the proportionate amount of all the fuels is over 30 %, the shredding of sludge followed by palletising or briquetting can be economical in increasing its bulk density sufficiently to render combustion easier. The sludge and other solid fuels can be fed alternately or in addition through a preheating treatment. Indirect drying utilises low- or medium-pressure steam, generated at the mill, which at best could still be used elsewhere as lower pressure steam. The direct drying method uses the flue-gases as a heat source.\n\nThe improvement of the overall combustion is case-specific. It can be achieved by adding efficient fuel pre-demoisturisation for certain solid fuels, by mechanical dewatering of the combustion materials or by drying them with heat. In general, when the initial moisture content of the fuel is in the range of 45 - 50 %, a 10 - 15 % improvement in heat economy has been recorded by increasing the dryness to 55 - 60 %. The drying of sludge up to 80 % dryness is possible.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn sludge dewatering, water emissions are increased through the dewatering of the sludge and are usually treated effectively in the biological waste water treatment plant. If the dewatered or dried rejects and sludge are incinerated, the energy content is recovered. The usable energy value depends on the achieved Dry Solids (DS) content before incineration and the composition and mixture of the material to be burnt. Generally, the energy content of the rejects and sludge that exceeds the energy needed for evaporation of the moisture in the rejects is surplus energy. Usually only ash from incinerators remains as solid waste/residue that can either be landfilled or used for other purposes (e.g. the construction industry).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nFor economic and environmental reasons, the drying of rejects and sludge is applied only if excess heat is available and the added heat can be utilised for this purpose (see Section 2.9.6.1.4). The incineration of process residues and waste is applicable to new and existing mills. \n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force to adopt this measure is to reduce waste to be disposed of in landfills.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe.\n\nFor sludge dewatering, efficient presses are used increasingly in order to achieve high dryness levels. Incineration in bark boilers and other incinerators is common in the sector (see Sections 2.6.1 and 2.9.7 and 5.3.10).\n\nReference literature\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3059015_abstract", "x": 0.6035185, "y": 0.29048052, "title": "SLUDGE DEHYDRATION SYSTEM AND SLUDGE DEHYDRATION METHOD", "year": 2016, "text": "A sludge dehydration method includes a recovery process of recovering specific material as a dewatering aid from sludge generated in a sewage treatment process and a dewatering process of performing solid-liquid separation on sludge in which the dewatering aid recovered in the recovery process and dewatering target sludge are mixed.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"5.3.4\" title=\"Minimisation of the disposal of process residues and sludge to landfill by efficient dewatering and incineration with energy recovery\">\n<references_to>2.6, 2.6.1, 2.6.1.2, 2.9.6.1</references_to>\n<referenced_by>5.3.10</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nMinimisation of the disposal of process residues and sludge to landfill by efficient dewatering and incineration with energy recovery\n\nDescription and achieved environmental benefits\nFinal cleaning rejects, fibre losses and sludge that are generated during pulp and paper manufacturing and water treatment must be dewatered before final disposal or further treatment.

Dewatering is carried out by means of wire presses or screw presses. Dewatering aims at removing water from the sludge as much as possible. Different types of mechanical equipment are available for this operation:\n\nbelt presses (twin wire presses)\nscrew presses\ndecanter centrifuges.\n\nMany installations have installed belt presses which have a reliable function and produce a Dry Solids (DS) content of 40 - 50 % with fibre sludge and 25 - 40 % with mixed fibre/biological/chemical sludge.\n\nScrew presses can be used in two ways: either to increase the Dry Solids (DS) content after the belt press dewatering, by which a Dry Solids (DS) increase of approximately 10 % can be obtained; or for direct dewatering as a higher Dry Solids (DS) content can be obtained by screw presses compared to dewatering with a belt press.\n\nAfter dewatering, the sludge and rejects can be dried (see Section 2.9.6.1.4) in order to increase the heating value of the materials for energy recovery in incineration plants. Incineration further reduces the amount of wastes sent from mechanical pulping to landfill disposal and recovers the energy content of the waste fractions. Incineration of the bark is carried out in bark boilers or in co-combustion plants using mixed fuels. Particularly for rather low Dry Solids (DS) sludge, fluidised bed boilers are presently the best option (see Section 2.6.1.2.3). These fluidised bed boilers can be run with 100 % sludge although the use of a support fuel is more common (like coal or oil). The requirement for the support fuel depends on the Dry Solids (DS) and the ash content of the sludge. Generally, at least 35 - 40 % Dry Solids (DS) is required for spontaneous combustion.\n\nFor detailed discussion of incineration with energy recovery including emission control techniques, the reader is referred to Sections 2.6 and 2.9.7.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe dewatering processes have been used in many pulp and paper mills. Incineration in bark boilers and other incinerators are common techniques in the sector (see Sections 2.6.1 and 2.9.7 and 5.3.10).\n\nThe heating value of rejects and sludge and the overall burning results can be improved by applying improved dewatering equipment such as screw presses. The dryness target should be 45 %, when the ash content is below 30 % and reaching for instance 65 - 70 % at 50 % ash content. However, the sludge mix and its material characteristics may vary significantly between mills and different sludges have different dewatering characteristics. For instance, excess sludge from biological treatment has relatively poor dewatering properties (18 - 22 % Dry Solids (DS)) if not mixed with other materials; by contrast, primary sludge from primary clarifiers is easier to dewater (35 - 55 % Dry Solids (DS)) but can also be mixed with other material for better dewatering.\n\nWhen the amount of sludge is high and the proportionate amount of all the fuels is over 30 %, the shredding of sludge followed by palletising or briquetting can be economical in increasing its bulk density sufficiently to render combustion easier. The sludge and other solid fuels can be fed alternately or in addition through a preheating treatment. Indirect drying utilises low- or medium-pressure steam, generated at the mill, which at best could still be used elsewhere as lower pressure steam. The direct drying method uses the flue-gases as a heat source.\n\nThe improvement of the overall combustion is case-specific. It can be achieved by adding efficient fuel pre-demoisturisation for certain solid fuels, by mechanical dewatering of the combustion materials or by drying them with heat. In general, when the initial moisture content of the fuel is in the range of 45 - 50 %, a 10 - 15 % improvement in heat economy has been recorded by increasing the dryness to 55 - 60 %. The drying of sludge up to 80 % dryness is possible.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn sludge dewatering, water emissions are increased through the dewatering of the sludge and are usually treated effectively in the biological waste water treatment plant. If the dewatered or dried rejects and sludge are incinerated, the energy content is recovered. The usable energy value depends on the achieved Dry Solids (DS) content before incineration and the composition and mixture of the material to be burnt. Generally, the energy content of the rejects and sludge that exceeds the energy needed for evaporation of the moisture in the rejects is surplus energy. Usually only ash from incinerators remains as solid waste/residue that can either be landfilled or used for other purposes (e.g. the construction industry).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nFor economic and environmental reasons, the drying of rejects and sludge is applied only if excess heat is available and the added heat can be utilised for this purpose (see Section 2.9.6.1.4).

Dewatering is carried out by means of wire presses or screw presses. Dewatering aims at removing water from the sludge as much as possible. Different types of mechanical equipment are available for this operation:\n\nbelt presses (twin wire presses)\nscrew presses\ndecanter centrifuges.\n\nMany installations have installed belt presses which have a reliable function and produce a Dry Solids (DS) content of 40 - 50 % with fibre sludge and 25 - 40 % with mixed fibre/biological/chemical sludge.\n\nScrew presses can be used in two ways: either to increase the Dry Solids (DS) content after the belt press dewatering, by which a Dry Solids (DS) increase of approximately 10 % can be obtained; or for direct dewatering as a higher Dry Solids (DS) content can be obtained by screw presses compared to dewatering with a belt press.\n\nAfter dewatering, the sludge and rejects can be dried (see Section 2.9.6.1.4) in order to increase the heating value of the materials for energy recovery in incineration plants. Incineration further reduces the amount of wastes sent from mechanical pulping to landfill disposal and recovers the energy content of the waste fractions. Incineration of the bark is carried out in bark boilers or in co-combustion plants using mixed fuels. Particularly for rather low Dry Solids (DS) sludge, fluidised bed boilers are presently the best option (see Section 2.6.1.2.3). These fluidised bed boilers can be run with 100 % sludge although the use of a support fuel is more common (like coal or oil). The requirement for the support fuel depends on the Dry Solids (DS) and the ash content of the sludge. Generally, at least 35 - 40 % Dry Solids (DS) is required for spontaneous combustion.\n\nFor detailed discussion of incineration with energy recovery including emission control techniques, the reader is referred to Sections 2.6 and 2.9.7.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe dewatering processes have been used in many pulp and paper mills. Incineration in bark boilers and other incinerators are common techniques in the sector (see Sections 2.6.1 and 2.9.7 and 5.3.10).\n\nThe heating value of rejects and sludge and the overall burning results can be improved by applying improved dewatering equipment such as screw presses. The dryness target should be 45 %, when the ash content is below 30 % and reaching for instance 65 - 70 % at 50 % ash content. However, the sludge mix and its material characteristics may vary significantly between mills and different sludges have different dewatering characteristics. For instance, excess sludge from biological treatment has relatively poor dewatering properties (18 - 22 % Dry Solids (DS)) if not mixed with other materials; by contrast, primary sludge from primary clarifiers is easier to dewater (35 - 55 % Dry Solids (DS)) but can also be mixed with other material for better dewatering.\n\nWhen the amount of sludge is high and the proportionate amount of all the fuels is over 30 %, the shredding of sludge followed by palletising or briquetting can be economical in increasing its bulk density sufficiently to render combustion easier. The sludge and other solid fuels can be fed alternately or in addition through a preheating treatment. Indirect drying utilises low- or medium-pressure steam, generated at the mill, which at best could still be used elsewhere as lower pressure steam. The direct drying method uses the flue-gases as a heat source.\n\nThe improvement of the overall combustion is case-specific. It can be achieved by adding efficient fuel pre-demoisturisation for certain solid fuels, by mechanical dewatering of the combustion materials or by drying them with heat. In general, when the initial moisture content of the fuel is in the range of 45 - 50 %, a 10 - 15 % improvement in heat economy has been recorded by increasing the dryness to 55 - 60 %. The drying of sludge up to 80 % dryness is possible.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn sludge dewatering, water emissions are increased through the dewatering of the sludge and are usually treated effectively in the biological waste water treatment plant. If the dewatered or dried rejects and sludge are incinerated, the energy content is recovered. The usable energy value depends on the achieved Dry Solids (DS) content before incineration and the composition and mixture of the material to be burnt.

Generally, at least 35 - 40 % Dry Solids (DS) is required for spontaneous combustion.\n\nFor detailed discussion of incineration with energy recovery including emission control techniques, the reader is referred to Sections 2.6 and 2.9.7.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe dewatering processes have been used in many pulp and paper mills. Incineration in bark boilers and other incinerators are common techniques in the sector (see Sections 2.6.1 and 2.9.7 and 5.3.10).\n\nThe heating value of rejects and sludge and the overall burning results can be improved by applying improved dewatering equipment such as screw presses. The dryness target should be 45 %, when the ash content is below 30 % and reaching for instance 65 - 70 % at 50 % ash content. However, the sludge mix and its material characteristics may vary significantly between mills and different sludges have different dewatering characteristics. For instance, excess sludge from biological treatment has relatively poor dewatering properties (18 - 22 % Dry Solids (DS)) if not mixed with other materials; by contrast, primary sludge from primary clarifiers is easier to dewater (35 - 55 % Dry Solids (DS)) but can also be mixed with other material for better dewatering.\n\nWhen the amount of sludge is high and the proportionate amount of all the fuels is over 30 %, the shredding of sludge followed by palletising or briquetting can be economical in increasing its bulk density sufficiently to render combustion easier. The sludge and other solid fuels can be fed alternately or in addition through a preheating treatment. Indirect drying utilises low- or medium-pressure steam, generated at the mill, which at best could still be used elsewhere as lower pressure steam. The direct drying method uses the flue-gases as a heat source.\n\nThe improvement of the overall combustion is case-specific. It can be achieved by adding efficient fuel pre-demoisturisation for certain solid fuels, by mechanical dewatering of the combustion materials or by drying them with heat. In general, when the initial moisture content of the fuel is in the range of 45 - 50 %, a 10 - 15 % improvement in heat economy has been recorded by increasing the dryness to 55 - 60 %. The drying of sludge up to 80 % dryness is possible.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn sludge dewatering, water emissions are increased through the dewatering of the sludge and are usually treated effectively in the biological waste water treatment plant. If the dewatered or dried rejects and sludge are incinerated, the energy content is recovered. The usable energy value depends on the achieved Dry Solids (DS) content before incineration and the composition and mixture of the material to be burnt. Generally, the energy content of the rejects and sludge that exceeds the energy needed for evaporation of the moisture in the rejects is surplus energy. Usually only ash from incinerators remains as solid waste/residue that can either be landfilled or used for other purposes (e.g. the construction industry).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nFor economic and environmental reasons, the drying of rejects and sludge is applied only if excess heat is available and the added heat can be utilised for this purpose (see Section 2.9.6.1.4). The incineration of process residues and waste is applicable to new and existing mills. \n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force to adopt this measure is to reduce waste to be disposed of in landfills.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in Europe.\n\nFor sludge dewatering, efficient presses are used increasingly in order to achieve high dryness levels. Incineration in bark boilers and other incinerators is common in the sector (see Sections 2.6.1 and 2.9.7 and 5.3.10).\n\nReference literature\n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3608299_abstract", "x": 0.49123353, "y": 0.41294822, "title": "METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF NANOMETRIC METAL OXIDE ADDITIVES THAT REDUCE SINTERING TEMPERATURE AND/OR INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY IN THE MANUFACTURE OF CERAMIC PIECES, IMPROVING MECHANICAL PROPERTIES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE VITRIFICATION PROPERTIES OF CERAMIC BODIES, TILES OR COATINGS", "year": 2020, "text": "The object of this invention is a process for manufacturing, conditioning and stabilization of a family of base additives sodium, potassium, boron, silicon, zinc, calcium oxides, among others, prepared by physicochemical and chemical synthesis methods that form nanometric structures, reformulated with deflocculant, sequestrants and dispersants additives that allow to obtain a dispersion or powder capable to decrease the sintering temperature of a ceramic body due to the high fluxing power, which is maximized by the use of nanotechnology in the structures obtained. The process consists in the preparation of nucleation seeds of metal, silicates and carbonates oxides by means of a physicochemical process, and which allow nanometric structures to grow by means of a chemical process in a chemical synthesis process wet basis of sodium, boron, silicon, zinc, potassium and calcium oxides.

Collection and incineration can cover more than 99 % of the total production-process-based emissions of gaseous sulphuric compounds. \n\nUseful treatment methods are incineration in the recovery boiler (see Section 3.3.16.1), lime kiln (see Section 3.3.16.2) or dedicated Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) burners (see Section 3.3.16.3). Also, scrubbers are used for cleaning dissolving tank vent gases or for reducing SO2 emissions from the separate Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) burner, the lime kiln or the recovery boiler. An overview of the efficient layout and operation of these gas collection systems is given below.\n\nI. Collection of concentrated malodorous gases\n\nThe target is to collect all the concentrated malodorous gases because they have a very high sulphur content, for example a softwood mill operating with an annual production of 600 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) would release over 1 300 t of sulphur to air (approximately 2 - 5 kg S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), see also Section 3.2.2.6.4) or more without proper collection and treatment of concentrated malodorous gases only.\n\nCollection points for the strong gases in the fibre line are:\n\ndigesters from the flash steam condenser\nturpentine decanters\nfoul condensate tanks\nturpentine scrubbers\nturpentine storage tanks\ntank fumes.\n\nThe collection point in the chemical recovery line is the foul condensate system, e.g. the foul condensate tanks (for example from evaporation and the recovery boiler), the foul condensate stripper and its condensers.\n\nGas ducts are equipped with water locks which condense some of the gases and also ensure that the gases flow in the right direction. Ejectors feed the gases to incineration (recovery boiler, lime kiln or separate Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) burner). Collection channels are also equipped with droplet separators and flame arresters, which prevent flames from going backwards in channels (as concentrated malodorous gases contain a large proportion of inflammable gas).\n\nFigure   3 .95 and Figure   3 .96 show two different efficient gas collection systems for strong malodorous gases including major collection points, treatment options and back-up systems.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.95:\tTreatment and collection systems of strong malodorous gases (Botnia Rauma mill)\n\n\nFigure   3 .96 shows a similar collection and back-up system but the strong gases for incineration are not sent to the lime kiln but to the recovery boiler.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.96:\tTreatment and collection systems of strong malodorous gases (Botnia Joutseno mill)\n\n\nII. Collection of dilute malodorous gases\n\nIn effective gas collection systems, almost all dilute or light malodorous gases are collected from the fibre line, the chemical recovery island and the causticising plant area. \n\nThe collection points for dilute malodorous gases in the fibre line are schematically shown in Figure   3 .97.\n\nFigure 3.97:\tTreatment and collection of dilute malodorous gases in the fibre line (Botnia Rauma mill)\n\n\na) The collection points in the fibre line\nThe collection points in the fibre line are the digester area, the brown pulp washers (for example diffuser or press washers or drum displacer washers), washer tanks, filtrate tanks, the wash liquor tank, knot return tank, oxygen delignification feed tank, and collection liquor tanks. All these emission sources are connected to the weak gas collection system.\n\nThe collection of acidic steam from the bleaching area is not shown in Figure   3 .97, e.g. from the chlorine dioxide bleaching towers and the subsequent washers or the SO2 fumes for chlorine dioxide elimination. In efficient systems, these gases are also collected and treated in a separate scrubber due to the high chloride content which causes a significant corrosion risk in burners.\n\nb) Collection points in the chemical recovery line\nThe collection points from the evaporation plant and the tall oil production area include a large number of the tank system's gas release points, e.g. the black liquor, strong liquor and condensate tanks, the intermediate liquor, weak liquor, spill liquor and tall oil soap storage tank, the soap equalisation tanks and the tall oil and soap oil tank. Other collection points are the tall oil cooking gas scrubber, the tall oil reactor and the oil separators. Schematically the gas collection system is shown in Figure   3 .98. The collected dilute gases are sent to the recovery boiler as combustion air.\n\n\nFigure 3.98:\tCollection and treatment of light odorous gases from the evaporation area and the tall oil cooking area (Botnia Rauma mill)\n\n\nc) Collection points in the causticising plant\nA very effective and thorough gas collection system also includes an almost complete collection of all weak malodorous gases in the causticising plant. The causticising fumes have lower malodorous sulphur contents than other sources. Collection points from the causticising plant tank area are green liquor tanks, green liquor dreg filters, dreg tanks, green liquor filters, green liquor filtrate tanks, hot water tanks, green liquor oxidation (if existing) and its steam condenser, lime-slaker and its washer, slaker steam washer, causticisation tanks, lime mud filter, white liquor tanks, lime mud storage tank, dilution water tanks, acid tank, canal ventilation system and heat exchanger before the lime kiln. Only in the newest mills are all low concentration malodorous gases in the causticising plant collected. Typically, causticising fumes have very low malodorous sulphur contents. Collection from the causticising plant tank area is almost as effective as the full collection.\n\nFigure   3 .99 shows an example of an efficient gas collection system for the light concentration odorous gases from the causticisation area (Botnia, Rauma, FI).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.99:\tCollection and treatment of weak odorous gases of the causticisation area (Botnia Rauma mill)\n\n\nd) Dissolving tank vent gases\nThe dissolving tank vent gas (Dissolving Tank Vent Gas (DTVG)) also contains high amounts of Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS)-sulphur and particulates (mainly sulphates). Vent gases have not traditionally been classified as non-condensable gases. However, if the vent gas is sent to the recovery boiler furnace, it must be handled in accordance with the instructions for handling dilute non-condensable gases because of its high moisture content. Often these vent gases were only be treated successfully with scrubbers. Alternatively, Dissolving Tank Vent Gas (DTVG) can also be burnt in more recently built recovery boilers and those modified for Dissolving Tank Vent Gas (DTVG) incineration, after removing moisture and particulate matter. This technique has been installed in existing recovery boilers in the Varkaus and Rosenthal mills for example (at an approximate cost of EUR 1 - 2 million per mill to install new fans, cooler, ducts and condensate separation).\n\nIf Dissolving Tank Vent Gas (DTVG) are burnt in the recovery boiler, a fan draws the vent gases from the dissolving tank, a condenser reduces the moisture of the gas and a scrubber reduces the particulate matter. Then the cleaned vent gas is combined with preheated air and a fan blows the air/gas mixture via ducts to the furnace. As an alternative route, the vent gas can be sent through the scrubber and then to the roof.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAn efficient gas collection and treatment system is essential for both sulphur emission and odour control. It limits the odour nuisance in the neighbourhood. The collection of malodorous gases has a significant impact on improving the air quality. Mills with an advanced collection system for light and highly concentrated malodorous gases can reduce the duration of odour nuisances to <1 % of the operating time. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe main target is the almost complete collection and treatment of malodorous gases. Because of the high sulphur and odour content of the strong malodorous gases, these gases should be collected (collection efficiency of >99 %) and treated with the highest availability (>97 %). For strong gases, back-up systems should be in place and be able to start operation as fast as possible, if needed.\n\nLow concentration malodorous gases should be collected and treated from all other points. Normally, low concentration malodorous gases do not have a back-up system for treatment because the odorous effect is not as strong as it is when the higher concentrations of Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) are released. Efficient systems have an automatised monitoring system for the immediate detection of undesired releases which are then reported directly to the control room. Dilute Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) gases should have a high gas collection efficiency (>95 %) and suitable treatment. The availability of the treatment system for light malodorous gases should be over 90 % of the operating hours. Otherwise the nuisance caused by these emissions to the community is significant. Sulphur emissions are significantly lower with an efficient malodorous gas collection and treatment system.\n\nThe equipment of the malodorous gas system also has to comply with security regulations, concerning work safety and inflammable liquids and gases. It must be reliable, properly designed (e.g. sufficient blower capacity to reach the targeted suction performance is vital) and operated by specially trained staff. It is essential that the appropriate process design solutions for malodorous gas systems be accompanied by correct and careful operation by the operators of the plant.\n\nOdorous gases contain a significant portion of water vapour. They also contain organic compounds that readily condense in typical operational conditions. It is important to design the collection system in such a way that dirty condensate can be effectively removed and treated. The condensate system needs to be designed so that backflow of air (dry out) during condensate removal can also be eliminated during mill shutdown. Many of the operational accidents occur during mill start-up or upsets through condensate formation and re-evaporation.\n\nMaintenance of the gas collection system is important to achieve the best performance and high availability. In strong gas systems, air leakages may cause gas dilution and the gas-air mixture to become potentially explosive. Therefore gas channels are to be kept in perfect condition. In dilute gas channels the problem is different: in process disturbance situations, gases may accumulate in a high concentration and enter the explosive zone. Under normal operating conditions, the weak malodorous gas system is operated at low pressure. Undesired leakages should be monitored continuously and automatically, e.g. by mini-anemometers for flow rate measurements in the pipe system, shuttle valves and the measurement of temperature changes in case of releases, etc. \n\nOne of the most important issues is the capacity of the collection system. A common mistake is to select dimensions which are too small for the collection ducts and process equipment, since normally all mills eventually produce more than the original capacity. Also the blower capacity must be sufficient to hold the whole system under low pressure.\n\nTo ensure a high availability of the system, water locks should be large enough so that the gases flow as expected. If not, malodorous gases may enter the wrong places in the process or go directly to air and cause a foul odour. The water level in locks should be monitored continuously. \n\nScrubbers and their nozzles also need surveillance and maintenance, especially when white liquor is used as a washing liquid (white liquor has a higher solids content than in NaOH). The operation of a scrubber should be monitored with measurements and, depending on the gas, the Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) reduction should be at least 50 %, since dimethylsulphide and dimethyldisulphide do not wash out.\n\nThe verification of the effectiveness of the collection system and the operating hours that weak gases are vented out via the stack can be calculated in an accurate way by the process automation of the mill.\n\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe efficient collection of malodorous (sulphur-containing) gases may cause a disequilibrium in the sulphur/sodium balance. If excess sulphur accumulates in the process, the excess sulphur may require removal from the process, e.g. by leaching the recovery boiler ash. \n\nIncineration of malodorous gases in the recovery boiler may affect the sulphur and NOX emissions from the recovery boiler.\n\nIncineration of sulphur-containing gases reduces the carbonate content and pH of the recovery boiler's precipitator ash. The additional sulphur in malodorous gases is first seen as a result of the replacement of carbonate with sulphate in the electrostatic precipitator ash. When the carbonate content becomes low, the remaining sulphur will be in the form of SO2 in the flue-gases. Before deciding whether to incinerate malodorous gases in the recovery boiler, it would be advisable to study in detail the recovery boiler's capacity to handle the additional sulphur load. Sulphur emissions from the recovery boiler can be reduced by decreasing the sulphidity of black liquors, by increasing the Dry Solids (DS) content of the concentrated black liquor or by the use of scrubbers.\n\nIn stable operation, sulphur emissions are low when incinerating concentrated malodorous gases, provided that the dry solids content of the combustion liquor is at least 72 % and the liquor load is almost full, at a sulphidity of ~40. \n\nIf malodorous gases are incinerated with a partial load, the pH and carbonate content of the electrostatic precipitator ash, and the SO2 content of flue-gases have to be evaluated case by base. A boiler operating continuously at partial load requires higher dry solids than a boiler operating at nominal load or above, in order to secure a trouble-free operation. If the amount of sulphur released with malodorous gases is so large that incineration generates SO2 emissions, the fouling and corrosion tendency of the boiler due to acid ash salts (low pH) will increase.\n\nEspecially concentrated malodorous gases contain nitrogen compounds. These nitrogen compounds consist mostly of ammonia, which is separated from black liquor in the evaporation plant. Some of these nitrogen compounds have been formed in the causticising area from the nitrogen that has entered the dissolving tank with the recovery boiler smelt and then recirculated through the cooking process to the recovery boiler. Theoretically the contribution on NOX is about 5 - 15 % of the total load, which is however difficult to verify with emission measurements.\n\nDilute malodorous gases contribute to less than 1 % of the NOX emissions of the recovery boiler. Their effect on the Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) load of the recovery boiler is significant only when the boiler is outside the normal operation zone, i.e. running at low capacity. Then the highest air register of the recovery boiler can be too cold for Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) combustion.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe systems described can be installed in new and existing mills. In many older mills some of the washing equipment is of the open type. Collection of vent gases from these sources of dilute gases requires the handling of very high air volumes which may be both technically and economically difficult.\n\nEconomics\nIn some cases, a more complex mill layout can complicate the collection of all the dilute malodorous gases. The piping cost and blower requirements may rise significantly in these cases. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nImproved sulphur recovery, which has cost advantages (but may also cause imbalances with regard to the S/Na control). Advanced malodorous gas collection and treatment improves the reputation of kraft pulp mills and the likelihood of general acceptance of their operation in the neighbourhood.\n\nExample plants\nAdvanced modern mills with malodorous gas collection and treatment systems of a similar type to the one described above can be found in Botnia Joutseno and Rauma mills (FI), Heinzel Pols (AU), or Mercer Stendal and Rosenthal mills (DE), etc.\n\nReference literature\n, , . \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2905264_abstract", "x": 0.5789236, "y": 0.29083928, "title": "Method of treatment of the effluents of coating", "year": 2015, "text": "The invention concerns a method of treatment of the effluents of coating from paper-making industry, said method comprises the following steps:\na) mixing of the effluents of coating with at least one coagulant agent which is a polymer chosen in the group constituted by the polyaluminium chlorides until obtaining by coagulation a mixture which comprises agglomerates ;\nb) performing a separation treatment on the mixture obtained in step a) to recover :\n- a concentrate containing the mineral and organic solid components that were present in the coating colour ;\n- a filtrate.\n \n  \n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"7.3.5\" title=\"Recovery of coating colours-recycling of pigments\">\n<references_to>7.3.6</references_to>\n<referenced_by>2.9.8, 7.1.6, 7.1.8, 7.3.3, 7.3.4, 7.3.6, 7.3.11</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nRecovery of coating colours/recycling of pigments \n\nDescription\nEffluents which contain coating colour are created during the flushing of coating equipment, paper breaks and production changes in paper and board mills manufacturing coating grades. These mills generate a hydraulically low flow waste water (about 2 - 5 % of the total flow) which is rich in pigments and adhesives (see also Section 7.3.6). The heavy solids load and the compounds which are sticky by nature in these waste waters may cause operating problems in the effluent treatment, if sewered there without an appropriate pretreatment. On the other hand, the pigments are expensive, so the (partial) recovery of the coating colour for reuse is cost-effective in most cases.\n\nEnvironmentally sound coating waste stream management comprises the items listed below.\n\nMinimum discharge of coating kitchen colours to sewer by efficient production and optimum inventory of prepared coating colours, especially when paper grade changes need a change in coating colour composition. Significant factors are efficient work routines and good housekeeping.\nOptimum design of coating colour kitchen and supply systems. \nSeparate collection of effluents which contain coating colour.\nCoating chemical recovery by ultrafiltration or other recovery techniques from coating waste water. \n\nI) Ultrafiltration\nUltrafiltration is a method in which water and chemicals are separated from each other using a semi-permeable membrane. The pores of the membrane are so small that they only let tiny molecules such as water, metallic ions, salts and starch monomers pass through, whereas the other components of the coating colour - pigments and binders - are too large to get through (see Figure   7 .297). The effluent fed into the process is typically 2 - 4 % solids content and that of the concentrate 30 % in one-stage systems and 43 - 44 % with an additional second stage for high solids concentrate (e.g. Husum mill, SE). Added to fresh coating colour it will not dilute too much. As shown in Figure   7 .299, a complete ultrafiltration system comprises the filter, necessary tanks, piping, field instruments and control system.\n\nFigure 7.299:\tExample of an ultrafiltration recovery system for coating colours \n\n\nII) Collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering\nThis technique is an alternative to UF which started in 2008 in a German paper mill that manufactures around 300 000 t/yr of triple coated paper. Figure   7 .300 shows the processing scheme for the recovery of coating colour rejects and rinsing water which contains coating colour. The coating colour recovery system consists of (i) the collection of effluents which contain coating colour in a central pit below the coating machine, (ii) a buffer tank and double-stage screening: 300 um pressure screen and a 100 um bow screen, (iii) a compact flocculation (cationic polymer and anionic polyacrylamide) and sedimentation unit for concentration of the pigments to 20 % Dry Solids (DS), (iv) a grinder (ball mill), (v), a decanter (anionic polyacrylamide added) for dewatering the slurry to 50 % Dry Solids (DS) and (vi) a dispersing tank where the dispersion is finished by adding NaOH, a dispersing agent and biocides. From there, the recovered dispersion is pumped to the coating kitchen. A 150 um control screening is installed in the pipe that leads to the dispersing units of the coating kitchen. The separated clear water is returned to the process (pulper) and leads to a reduction in the total water consumption of the mill of 0.43 m3/t.\n\nThe advantage of this robust system compared to other options is that the impurities in the collected rinsing waters such as paper abrasion, agglomerates, fibres, dirt or sand are crushed in the ball mill to a particle fineness of 60 % of all particles below 2 microns and thus they no longer interfere with the subsequent reuse of the coating pigments.\n\nFigure 7.300:\tProcessing scheme for the recovery of coating colour rejects and waste water\n\n\nThe collected effluents enter the system with approximately 0.5 - 5 % dry solids content and leave it at approximately 50 % Dry Solids (DS). The coating colour recycling rate is almost 100 %. No negative impacts on the coating colour quality have been detected.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAfter treating the colour effluents with ultrafiltration or other efficient recovery systems (see, e.g. Figure   7 .300), the retentate can be reused as coating colour and the permeate can replace fresh water (water savings). At the same time, the organic (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)) and hydraulic load on the external treatment plant and the generated sludge are reduced. An example mill reduced the total solid waste of the entire mill by 60 % by putting into operation an effective coating effluent recovery system. Less transport of pigments and waste is another benefit.\n\nThe coating colour recovery option 'collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering' achieves some energy savings when compared to the processing of the natural pigments which requires approximately 150 kWh/t; in contrast, the whole coating colour recovery system requires approximately 105 kWh/t of pigment recovered, which means that the recycling option requires 30 % less electrical energy compared to the grinding of fresh pigments.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe application of ultrafiltration has proven successful in many mills. No negative effects on fine and art paper quality have been reported when using concentrate as a precoat. In magazine paper mills, small amounts of UF concentrate can be used without drawbacks in quality. In a board mill, the recovered coating colour is reused for back coating. The amount of concentrate must be constant. Also, bacteria and hygiene are important aspects to be considered. The lifetime of the membrane can exceed one year. The typical washing frequency is once a week, creating a liquid waste of about 2 - 5 m3. Good results have been achieved for instance with polymer membranes using the cross-flow principle (or cross-rotation filtration).\n\nThe recovery option 'dewatering - grinding - thickening' (see Figure   7 .300) produces pigments that have a defined grain size distribution. The quality of the recovered coating pigment is very similar to the originally used calcium carbonate. No problems with 'white pitch' (latex binder from recycled coated broke) have been observed. The process allows the reuse of almost 100 % of the coating pigments from the waste water (in the example case, 6 - 10 tonnes of pigments per day, oven dry), thus reducing the waste water load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)), and the need to transport pigments and sludge. The treated flow is 400 m3/day.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique achieves significant savings in terms of transport, raw material needed (pigments) and quantity of solid waste to be disposed of. Ultrafiltration and the alternative coating colour recovery systems require electrical energy and some chemicals for operation; however, the required power is overcompensated by having recovered the pigments. Reduction of coating waste water discharge improves the performance of the effluent treatment and the organic load to be treated. Depending on the coating/paper produced ratio, the amount of solid waste can be lowered by 60 %. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nManagement of remaining coating colours after application and separate collection of coating effluents for their subsequent treatment can be applied at both new and existing mills. Ultrafiltration is applicable for most mills manufacturing coated grades such as magazine paper, fine paper or board. This coating colour recovery system can be unsuitable for some speciality grades, e.g. if effluent volumes are very small or are generated in various places of the mill, when many changes in coating occur in a short time or if the different coating colour recipes are unsuitable for mixing. In these cases, the coating effluents are sent directly to the waste water treatment plant or are treated separately by precipitation before entering the biological treatment (see Section 7.3.6). With ultrafiltration, the achievable concentration of the recovered solids is limited to about 35 - 45 %. If there is no excess water in the formulation of the coating colour, it can be difficult to reuse all the concentrate.\n\nThe alternative coating colour recovery system (see Figure   7 .300) that uses a ball mill followed by a thickener as the core process is suitable for all mills that have a significant amount of coating colours that are sewered (e.g. multiple coatings, larger mills). Because of the very effective grinder, the system is very robust, not sensitive to disturbances and delivers a pigment quality that can be used in most coating applications. Solids concentrations of > 50 % Dry Solids (DS) can be achieved.\n\nEconomics\nI) Economic calculation of the ultrafiltration coating colour recovery process\nThe example calculation refers to a paper mill that produces 800 tonnes of coated paper/day and has 330 working days/year. The coating colour production is 30 % of the paper production or 240 t/day Dry Solids (DS). The economic calculation is approximated in Table   7 .187.\n\nTable 7.187:\tEconomic calculation of the ultrafiltration coating colour recovery process\n\n\nII) Economic calculation of the recovery option 'collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering'\nThis recovery option enables nearly 100 % recovery of the coating colours. Savings of approximately EUR 840 000/year were achieved (data base: 2009) consisting of reduced costs for coating pigments (approximately EUR 265 000/year), sludge disposal (approximately EUR 500 000/year), waste water (EUR 65 000/year) and fresh water (approximately EUR 10 000/year). Operating costs amounted to EUR 350 000 per year including costs for chemicals (EUR 300 000/year), energy (EUR 20 000/year) and maintenance and repairs (EUR 20 000/year). In the example case, the recovery system generates payment surpluses of EUR 510 000/year. The investment cost of the coating colour recovery system was EUR 1 million for a mill that manufactures 300 000 t/yr of triple coated paper; treated flow 400 m3/day; 10 t pigments recovered/day. The payback time of the investment is 1.65 years (without subsidies).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nImprovement of raw material economy in production (minimisation of coating losses). The key factor for implementation of UF is reducing the costs for the raw materials (costly coating colours) and for waste disposal. Furthermore, the technique reduces the load of suspended solids and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) discharged and improves the operability of the effluent treatment. It is the preferred option compared to the pretreatment of coating waste water.\n\nExample plants\nExample plants for ultrafiltration of coating-containing effluent recovery and reuse of the original pigments follow: Blendecques board mill, FR; Assi Frovifors board mill, SE; Cascades Djupafors board mill, SE; Hansol Taejon board mill, South Korea; Yuen Foong Yu Fine Paper mill, Taiwan; Metsa-Serla Kirkniemi, FI; Metsa-Serla Aanekoski, FI; Alkaline Peroxide Pulping (APP) Pindo Deli, Fine paper mill, Indonesia; MD Papier Plattling, DE; SCA Fine Paper Stockstadt, DE; Papierfabrik Albbruck, DE; M-real Husum, SE; Zhuhai S.E.Z Hongta Renheng board mill, China; Sun Cartonboard, China; Henan Pyuang, China; Hokuetsu Paper Mills, Niigata, Japan; Klabin S.A.

As shown in Figure   7 .299, a complete ultrafiltration system comprises the filter, necessary tanks, piping, field instruments and control system.\n\nFigure 7.299:\tExample of an ultrafiltration recovery system for coating colours \n\n\nII) Collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering\nThis technique is an alternative to UF which started in 2008 in a German paper mill that manufactures around 300 000 t/yr of triple coated paper.

The typical washing frequency is once a week, creating a liquid waste of about 2 - 5 m3. Good results have been achieved for instance with polymer membranes using the cross-flow principle (or cross-rotation filtration).\n\nThe recovery option 'dewatering - grinding - thickening' (see Figure   7 .300) produces pigments that have a defined grain size distribution. The quality of the recovered coating pigment is very similar to the originally used calcium carbonate. No problems with 'white pitch' (latex binder from recycled coated broke) have been observed. The process allows the reuse of almost 100 % of the coating pigments from the waste water (in the example case, 6 - 10 tonnes of pigments per day, oven dry), thus reducing the waste water load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)), and the need to transport pigments and sludge. The treated flow is 400 m3/day.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique achieves significant savings in terms of transport, raw material needed (pigments) and quantity of solid waste to be disposed of. Ultrafiltration and the alternative coating colour recovery systems require electrical energy and some chemicals for operation; however, the required power is overcompensated by having recovered the pigments. Reduction of coating waste water discharge improves the performance of the effluent treatment and the organic load to be treated. Depending on the coating/paper produced ratio, the amount of solid waste can be lowered by 60 %. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nManagement of remaining coating colours after application and separate collection of coating effluents for their subsequent treatment can be applied at both new and existing mills. Ultrafiltration is applicable for most mills manufacturing coated grades such as magazine paper, fine paper or board. This coating colour recovery system can be unsuitable for some speciality grades, e.g. if effluent volumes are very small or are generated in various places of the mill, when many changes in coating occur in a short time or if the different coating colour recipes are unsuitable for mixing. In these cases, the coating effluents are sent directly to the waste water treatment plant or are treated separately by precipitation before entering the biological treatment (see Section 7.3.6). With ultrafiltration, the achievable concentration of the recovered solids is limited to about 35 - 45 %. If there is no excess water in the formulation of the coating colour, it can be difficult to reuse all the concentrate.\n\nThe alternative coating colour recovery system (see Figure   7 .300) that uses a ball mill followed by a thickener as the core process is suitable for all mills that have a significant amount of coating colours that are sewered (e.g. multiple coatings, larger mills). Because of the very effective grinder, the system is very robust, not sensitive to disturbances and delivers a pigment quality that can be used in most coating applications. Solids concentrations of > 50 % Dry Solids (DS) can be achieved.\n\nEconomics\nI) Economic calculation of the ultrafiltration coating colour recovery process\nThe example calculation refers to a paper mill that produces 800 tonnes of coated paper/day and has 330 working days/year. The coating colour production is 30 % of the paper production or 240 t/day Dry Solids (DS). The economic calculation is approximated in Table   7 .187.\n\nTable 7.187:\tEconomic calculation of the ultrafiltration coating colour recovery process\n\n\nII) Economic calculation of the recovery option 'collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering'\nThis recovery option enables nearly 100 % recovery of the coating colours. Savings of approximately EUR 840 000/year were achieved (data base: 2009) consisting of reduced costs for coating pigments (approximately EUR 265 000/year), sludge disposal (approximately EUR 500 000/year), waste water (EUR 65 000/year) and fresh water (approximately EUR 10 000/year). Operating costs amounted to EUR 350 000 per year including costs for chemicals (EUR 300 000/year), energy (EUR 20 000/year) and maintenance and repairs (EUR 20 000/year). In the example case, the recovery system generates payment surpluses of EUR 510 000/year. The investment cost of the coating colour recovery system was EUR 1 million for a mill that manufactures 300 000 t/yr of triple coated paper; treated flow 400 m3/day; 10 t pigments recovered/day. The payback time of the investment is 1.65 years (without subsidies).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nImprovement of raw material economy in production (minimisation of coating losses). The key factor for implementation of UF is reducing the costs for the raw materials (costly coating colours) and for waste disposal. Furthermore, the technique reduces the load of suspended solids and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) discharged and improves the operability of the effluent treatment. It is the preferred option compared to the pretreatment of coating waste water.\n\nExample plants\nExample plants for ultrafiltration of coating-containing effluent recovery and reuse of the original pigments follow: Blendecques board mill, FR; Assi Frovifors board mill, SE; Cascades Djupafors board mill, SE; Hansol Taejon board mill, South Korea; Yuen Foong Yu Fine Paper mill, Taiwan; Metsa-Serla Kirkniemi, FI; Metsa-Serla Aanekoski, FI; Alkaline Peroxide Pulping (APP) Pindo Deli, Fine paper mill, Indonesia; MD Papier Plattling, DE; SCA Fine Paper Stockstadt, DE; Papierfabrik Albbruck, DE; M-real Husum, SE; Zhuhai S.E.Z Hongta Renheng board mill, China; Sun Cartonboard, China; Henan Pyuang, China; Hokuetsu Paper Mills, Niigata, Japan; Klabin S.A.

These mills generate a hydraulically low flow waste water (about 2 - 5 % of the total flow) which is rich in pigments and adhesives (see also Section 7.3.6). The heavy solids load and the compounds which are sticky by nature in these waste waters may cause operating problems in the effluent treatment, if sewered there without an appropriate pretreatment. On the other hand, the pigments are expensive, so the (partial) recovery of the coating colour for reuse is cost-effective in most cases.\n\nEnvironmentally sound coating waste stream management comprises the items listed below.\n\nMinimum discharge of coating kitchen colours to sewer by efficient production and optimum inventory of prepared coating colours, especially when paper grade changes need a change in coating colour composition. Significant factors are efficient work routines and good housekeeping.\nOptimum design of coating colour kitchen and supply systems. \nSeparate collection of effluents which contain coating colour.\nCoating chemical recovery by ultrafiltration or other recovery techniques from coating waste water. \n\nI) Ultrafiltration\nUltrafiltration is a method in which water and chemicals are separated from each other using a semi-permeable membrane. The pores of the membrane are so small that they only let tiny molecules such as water, metallic ions, salts and starch monomers pass through, whereas the other components of the coating colour - pigments and binders - are too large to get through (see Figure   7 .297). The effluent fed into the process is typically 2 - 4 % solids content and that of the concentrate 30 % in one-stage systems and 43 - 44 % with an additional second stage for high solids concentrate (e.g. Husum mill, SE). Added to fresh coating colour it will not dilute too much. As shown in Figure   7 .299, a complete ultrafiltration system comprises the filter, necessary tanks, piping, field instruments and control system.\n\nFigure 7.299:\tExample of an ultrafiltration recovery system for coating colours \n\n\nII) Collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering\nThis technique is an alternative to UF which started in 2008 in a German paper mill that manufactures around 300 000 t/yr of triple coated paper. Figure   7 .300 shows the processing scheme for the recovery of coating colour rejects and rinsing water which contains coating colour. The coating colour recovery system consists of (i) the collection of effluents which contain coating colour in a central pit below the coating machine, (ii) a buffer tank and double-stage screening: 300 um pressure screen and a 100 um bow screen, (iii) a compact flocculation (cationic polymer and anionic polyacrylamide) and sedimentation unit for concentration of the pigments to 20 % Dry Solids (DS), (iv) a grinder (ball mill), (v), a decanter (anionic polyacrylamide added) for dewatering the slurry to 50 % Dry Solids (DS) and (vi) a dispersing tank where the dispersion is finished by adding NaOH, a dispersing agent and biocides. From there, the recovered dispersion is pumped to the coating kitchen. A 150 um control screening is installed in the pipe that leads to the dispersing units of the coating kitchen. The separated clear water is returned to the process (pulper) and leads to a reduction in the total water consumption of the mill of 0.43 m3/t.\n\nThe advantage of this robust system compared to other options is that the impurities in the collected rinsing waters such as paper abrasion, agglomerates, fibres, dirt or sand are crushed in the ball mill to a particle fineness of 60 % of all particles below 2 microns and thus they no longer interfere with the subsequent reuse of the coating pigments.\n\nFigure 7.300:\tProcessing scheme for the recovery of coating colour rejects and waste water\n\n\nThe collected effluents enter the system with approximately 0.5 - 5 % dry solids content and leave it at approximately 50 % Dry Solids (DS). The coating colour recycling rate is almost 100 %. No negative impacts on the coating colour quality have been detected.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAfter treating the colour effluents with ultrafiltration or other efficient recovery systems (see, e.g. Figure   7 .300), the retentate can be reused as coating colour and the permeate can replace fresh water (water savings). At the same time, the organic (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)) and hydraulic load on the external treatment plant and the generated sludge are reduced. An example mill reduced the total solid waste of the entire mill by 60 % by putting into operation an effective coating effluent recovery system. Less transport of pigments and waste is another benefit.\n\nThe coating colour recovery option 'collection - screening - concentration - grinding - dewatering' achieves some energy savings when compared to the processing of the natural pigments which requires approximately 150 kWh/t; in contrast, the whole coating colour recovery system requires approximately 105 kWh/t of pigment recovered, which means that the recycling option requires 30 % less electrical energy compared to the grinding of fresh pigments.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe application of ultrafiltration has proven successful in many mills. No negative effects on fine and art paper quality have been reported when using concentrate as a precoat. In magazine paper mills, small amounts of UF concentrate can be used without drawbacks in quality. In a board mill, the recovered coating colour is reused for back coating. The amount of concentrate must be constant. Also, bacteria and hygiene are important aspects to be considered. The lifetime of the membrane can exceed one year. The typical washing frequency is once a week, creating a liquid waste of about 2 - 5 m3. Good results have been achieved for instance with polymer membranes using the cross-flow principle (or cross-rotation filtration).\n\nThe recovery option 'dewatering - grinding - thickening' (see Figure   7 .300) produces pigments that have a defined grain size distribution.

The process allows the reuse of almost 100 % of the coating pigments from the waste water (in the example case, 6 - 10 tonnes of pigments per day, oven dry), thus reducing the waste water load (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)), and the need to transport pigments and sludge. The treated flow is 400 m3/day.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique achieves significant savings in terms of transport, raw material needed (pigments) and quantity of solid waste to be disposed of. Ultrafiltration and the alternative coating colour recovery systems require electrical energy and some chemicals for operation; however, the required power is overcompensated by having recovered the pigments. Reduction of coating waste water discharge improves the performance of the effluent treatment and the organic load to be treated. Depending on the coating/paper produced ratio, the amount of solid waste can be lowered by 60 %. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nManagement of remaining coating colours after application and separate collection of coating effluents for their subsequent treatment can be applied at both new and existing mills.

Aerated lagoons, as well as anaerobic plants, typically generate less sludge. \n\nSludge handling in paper mills includes the following main stages:\n\nreuse of fibre sludge from primary treatment, which is practised in many cases;\nthickening and dewatering of fibre/biological/(chemical) sludge;\nfinal disposal of dewatered sludge.\n\nReuse of fibre sludge is practised in cases where this is suitable with regard to product requirements. In the presence of biological/chemical sludges, at least a part of the fibre sludge should be dewatered, rather than reused. This is because biological and chemical sludge have very poor dewatering properties, and normally they are mixed with some fibre sludge to achieve acceptable dewatering properties. \n\nThe dewatering aims at removing water from the sludge as far as possible, in order to reduce transport costs and facilitate final disposal. Different types of mechanical equipment are available for this operation.\n\nBiological and chemical sludge is normally pre-dewatered prior to the dewatering and thickening. This means an increase of Dry Solids (DS) content from about 1 - 2 % to 3 - 4 % or higher. The pre-dewatering of sludge is usually performed in gravity tables, gravity disc thickeners, hydrostatic disc thickeners and, for biosludge, also by thickener centrifuges.\n\nPrior to dewatering, the sludge normally must be conditioned with flocculants. Usually a polyelectrolyte is added. This refers particularly to sludge mixtures with biological and/or chemical sludge, but fibre-containing sludges are often also conditioned by adding flocculants.\n\nDewatering equipment includes the following types:\n\nbelt presses (double wire presses),\nscrew presses,\ndecanter centrifuges,\nchamber filter presses. \n\nInstallations built during the 1980s and 1990s were fitted with belt presses. They have a reliable function and produce fairly high Dry Solids (DS) values: 40 - 50 % with fibre sludge and 25 - 40 % with mixed fibre/biological(chemical) sludge. However, a more recent trend is to use screw presses.\n\nScrew presses can be used in two ways: \n\nto increase the Dry Solids (DS) content after belt press dewatering; an approximate Dry Solids (DS) increase of 10 % can be obtained;\ndirect dewatering; a higher Dry Solids (DS) content can be obtained compared to belt press dewatering.\n\nAn increasing application of screw presses has been observed for some years, due to an increasing interest in sludge incineration, requiring high Dry Solids (DS) values. When the sludge is incinerated, the drying of sludge should also be considered in order to improve the heating value (see Section 2.9.6.1.4).\n\nDecanter centrifuges are mostly used for sludge with very poor dewatering properties, such as pure chemical sludge or biological sludge (if it is dewatered separately). They produce lower Dry Solids (DS) contents than the belt and screw presses.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe sludge dewatering can reduce the sludge volume and weight resulting in less transport and less volume for disposal.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor fibre sludge pre-dewatering, continuous rotary drum filters or gravity disc thickeners are also operated in the paper industry resulting in approximately 8 % Dry Solids (DS) together with a clear filtrate that has a low content of suspended solids.\n\nMany types of dewatering equipment, ranging from low-efficiency drum filters (in terms of Dry Solids (DS) content) to high efficiency screw presses, have been used in all types of paper and board mills. Belt presses (double wire presses) and screw presses used to achieve high sludge dryness have proven to be efficient in most cases. \n\nCross-media effects\nNo significant effects reported.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measure can be adopted in new and existing mills.\n\nEconomics\nThe reported costs refer to the amount and type of sludge to be thickened and dewatered. According to data from a supplier , the total investment costs for a sludge thickening/dewatering system for sludge from the paper industry including a pre-thickener and screw presses (only machinery without instrumentation, electrical and control technology, pipes, valves or construction works) are:\nfor 5 - 10 BDt/d, i.e. bone dry tonnes of sludge per day: approximately EUR 16 000 - 31 000 per tonne of sludge (bone dry) per day\nfor 50 - 100 BDt/d: approximately EUR 8 000 - 16 000 BDt/d.\n\nThe lower values refer to sludge with better dewatering properties such as fibre sludge or deinking sludge; the higher values refer to sludge with higher proportions of biological and chemical sludge that are more difficult to dewater. The dry solids content of the sludge is increased from 1.5 - 3 % to up to 40 - 60 %.\n\nOperating costs for screw presses are:\n\nenergy costs: EUR 1.5 - 3/tonne of sludge (bone dry) per day;\ncost for flocculants: EUR 4 - 16/tonne of sludge (bone dry) per day;\nmaintenance costs per year are approximately 5 - 10 % of the machinery investment costs (mainly for processing the screw shaft and new screen baskets). \n\nThe costs depend to a certain extent on the sludge composition and demand for flocculation chemicals.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nA high dry solids content for transportation and final disposal is the driving force to implement this technique. This technique produces the highest possible dry solids content and thus higher upper heating value if incineration is the final treatment option.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants all over the world for all types of effluents.\n\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4067314_abstract", "x": 0.5793522, "y": 0.2840169, "title": "PROCESS FOR RECYCLING WASTE FROM THE TREATMENT PLANTS OF INDUSTRIES THAT PRODUCE PIGMENTS, DYES, ANILINES AND COLOUR ENHANCERS, AND USE OF THE TREATED SLUDGE, SEDIMENT OR PETRY SLUDGE", "year": 2022, "text": "This invention refers, in general, to the technological sector of recycling of aqueous chemical wastes that boost color in industrial processes, more specifically, to a recycling and reuse process for liquid, paste, or solid wastes obtained from wastes in its process of origin, commonly known as sludge from liquid wastes treatment plants, for its recycling back into the process in related industry sectors, boosting color, equalizing color in fibers and providing improvements in the processes where it is introduced.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"7.3.14\" title=\"Prevention, reuse, recycling and treatment of process residues\">\n<references_to>2.9.8</references_to>\n\n<content>\nPrevention, reuse, recycling and treatment of process residues\n\nSee Section 2.9.8.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4207434_abstract", "x": 0.563663, "y": 0.32763842, "title": "WET SEPARATION PROCESS FOR WASTE LITHIUM BATTERIES AND USE THEREOF", "year": 2023, "text": "Disclosed are a wet sorting process for a waste lithium battery and application thereof, which belong to the field of battery material recycling.

In case of product changes and during breaks, the supply system has to be washed (disperger, chests, pumps, piping, and coater station). Furthermore, sometimes not all of the coating colours can be completely used and the rest are washed as well. The concentrated discharge can be collected in tanks or mobile containers for solid waste disposal.\nDiluted coating components from washing water from tanks, pipes, etc.\t\n\nThe dry solids content of diluted coating colour effluents is typically 2 - 4 %. If these effluents are directly discharged to the waste water treatment plant, sudden high organic peak loads would have to be handled in the treatment plant (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) values of >10 000 mg/l up to 100 000 mg/l). Therefore, the diluted spills are better collected in tanks and pretreated before discharge to the external waste water treatment plant. \n\nIf waste waters are not treated before biological treatment they can have adverse effects on the waste water treatment plant, causing difficulties in primary clarification and in the subsequent biological steps.\n\nA typical pretreatment consists of collection, precipitation and dewatering. The coating colour waste waters are separated from other process water, collected and sent to an equalisation basin. From there, the waste water is screened and pumped to chemical precipitation. The flocculation chemicals are added in a rapid mixing zone. Aluminium sulphate and polyaluminium chlorides are used as precipitation chemicals. Polyelectrolyte is used as a flocculation aid and is dosed into the flocculation tanks. The flocculated waste water flows into a lamella clarifier where the suspended solids settle on the bottom of the clarifier and the clear overflow is discharged to the waste water channel for further treatment. Sludge from the bottom of the clarifier is collected to a sludge tank and from there it is pumped to a centrifuge for dewatering. The dewatered sludge at a concentration of about 30 - 40 % is transported to waste recovery or landfilling.\n\nThere is at least one mill however where the precipitated coating colours are dewatered by centrifugation and reused as coating colour for the precoat. This option is still being developed.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe main achievements are operational benefits in the waste water treatment plant (Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)). Total suspended solids (Total Suspended Solids (TSS)) and organic loads to the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) are reduced and also accidental spills (sudden loads of suspended solids) to the treatment plant can be minimised. The upsets of the primary clarifier can be reduced because there are fewer sudden disturbances in the settling of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) or increases in the torque of the clarifier drive mechanism. The risk of clarifier overloading is reduced. The upsets of the biological system are reduced because the inert matter (pigment particles) in coating effluent is not carried over and accumulated in the active biomass of the biological treatment process. Thus, the environmental load is reduced. The clear filtrate from the coating colour effluent treatment can be reused elsewhere in the paper mill, for instance for dilution of coated or uncoated broke. However, waste water streams are only controlled and concentrated but waste remains. Therefore the recovery and recycling of effluents which contain coating colours (Section 7.3.5) is considered the preferred option.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe process has been used for many years in paper mills across Europe. However, some difficulties have been detected from the dewatering of the sludge produced during precipitation.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe separation of coating colour effluents from the biological waste water treatment normally has a positive effect on the further treatment of the biological sludge. It is easier to incinerate the dewatered excess sludge of the main waste water treatment plant of the mill because a separate pretreatment for coating waste water reduces the ash content of the main sludge streams.\n\nFor the flocculation unit, flocculation chemicals and chemicals for pH adjustment are required, resulting in a certain increase of salts in the effluent.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe pretreatment of coating waste water can be applied at both new and existing mills. However, in existing mills the arrangements for waste water collection and rerouting may be more complicated and more expensive. For new installations, recovery of coating colour (see Section 7.3.5) is the preferred option.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment for the separate coating waste water treatment by means of flocculation is about EUR 1.2 - 1.4 million for a production of about 1 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)/d. The annual operating costs are EUR 75 000 - 150 000 per year, excluding landfill costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force to adopt this measure is the difficulties in the external waste water treatment plant if this pretreatment is not applied. The high Total Suspended Solids (TSS) load and chemical composition of coating waste water can upset the operation of the primary clarifier and the biological process and result in sludge incineration problems.\n\nExample plants\nNumerous plants in western Europe (DE, AT, FR, SE, FI).\n\nReference literature\n.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3466902_abstract", "x": 0.49349543, "y": 0.36106887, "title": "METHOD FOR PRODUCING CALCIUM CARBONATE SINTERED COMPACT", "year": 2019, "text": "Provided is a method for producing a calcium carbonate sintered compact by which sintering can be done at a lower temperature and a higher-density calcium carbonate sintered compact can be produced.

This is especially true for mills processing paper for recycling, where this trend is further intensified by continuously increasing water circuit closure. Depending on the degree of system closure, the calcium concentration can exceed more than 1 500 mg/l. Consequent precipitation and scaling mostly as calcium carbonate occur in the water systems, e.g. in section rolls, wires, felts and shower nozzles, in heat exchanger systems as well as in biological waste water treatment plants. Precipitation and scaling of calcium carbonate can be the limitation for reusing biologically treated water as process water because the potential for precipitation in this water stream is especially high . Removal of calcium from process water allows mills processing paper for recycling with advanced water circuit closure to keep using paper for recycling. \n\nThe avoidance of calcium carbonate precipitation and scaling can be achieved by various measures:\n\nUse of chemical additives as precipitation inhibitors. A phosphonate inhibitor is used in a German paper mill with a totally closed water system. The inhibitor is added to the biologically anaerobic-aerobic treated process water in a concentration of 40 ppm. This treated process water is mainly used for the replacement of fresh water as shower water in the paper machine. Since the usage of the inhibitor, calcium carbonate scaling on section rolls, wires and felts and shower nozzles has been minimised to a very low level. The runnability of the paper machine has increased considerably.\nLowering of calcium concentration by controlled precipitation of calcium carbonate.\nAccording to the carbonate-bicarbonate equilibrium, the precipitation of calcium carbonate depends on the pH value of the process water and the corresponding concentration of carbonates. The appropriate water stream for a controlled precipitation is the effluent of an anaerobic reactor. The pH value in this effluent already lies in the range of 6.8 - 7.2 and can be increased by use of alkaline solutions or by stripping the CO2 generated from biological degradation.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn German mills processing paper for recycling, two systems for calcium carbonate precipitation are installed. The first system is an aeration reactor. Compressed air is pumped into a reactor filled with process water via two closed-circuit pipes , \n. The stripping of CO2 results in an increase of the pH up to 7.8 - 8.0. In this pH range calcium carbonate begins to form and is then sedimented. The reduction in calcium concentration, measured as water hardness, is only in a range of 10 - 20 %. A further increase in pH value can be obtained by the use of lime milk. At pH values of about 8.0 - 8.4, the hardness reduction rates are in the range of 50 - 90 % The hardness of the untreated effluent of the anaerobic reactor is about 60deg dH, corresponding to a calcium concentration of about 400 mg/l. The sedimented calcium carbonate, removed continuously at the conic bottom of the reactor, is reused in the paper manufacturing process. In 2001, two of these aeration reactors with a volume of 320 m3 each were installed as a second treatment stage after an anaerobic Internal Circulation (IC) reactor in the Julius Schulte Sohne paper mill, in Dusseldorf, DE. The treated effluent volume is about 850 m3/d. This system has not yet been installed in other German paper mills. \n\nA further development of the described aeration reactor is the lime trap. This system is based on the dissolved air flotation principle. The shift in pH value is achieved by the stripping of CO2 and the addition of a sodium hydroxide solution. The precipitated calcium carbonate is floated and removed by a sludge collection scrubber in the upper part of the flotation cell. This kind of dissolved air flotation, already well known in papermaking, is used for the separation of solids from white water.\n\nIn the German paper industry, four lime traps have so far been installed. The largest plant is installed in a mill processing paper for recycling with an annual production of Light-weight Coated (LWC) and white-coated Testliner of about 600 000 tonnes. A volume of 700 - 800 m3/h of anaerobically purified effluent is treated in the lime trap in order to prevent calcium carbonate scaling in the membrane aeration system of the activated sludge plant.\n\nThe pH value in the effluent is shifted by CO2 stripping and the addition of sodium hydroxide from 7.2 - 7.5 to 7.9 - 8.1. The necessary amount of sodium hydroxide solution (50 % by weight) is between 0.25 l/m3 and 0.45 l/m3. The water hardness in the influent of the lime trap is about 40deg dH. In the effluent, the hardness is reduced to 20deg dH. Reduction rates of over 50 % can be achieved with the application of a higher amount of sodium hydroxide. In the case described, the obtained hardness of 20deg dH is sufficient to guarantee only an insignificant calcium carbonate scaling in pipes and in the following treatment stages. Cleaning of the aggregates is not necessary.\n\n\nCross-media effects\nControlled precipitation of calcium carbonate in most applications requires some sodium hydroxide to increase the pH value of the process water. However, there are developments to reduce the need for NaOH dosing. The decarbonisation stage at the Tillmann paper mill (see Section 6.3.4) achieves the targeted calcium reduction with air injection only.\n\nThe sedimented calcium carbonate, removed continuously from the reactor, can either be reused in the paper manufacturing process or delivered to other users.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique can be applied to both new and existing mills. Reactor design, air injection devices and the possible dosing of sodium hydroxide require some adaption to optimise the process.\n\nEconomics\nOption a) The costs of inhibitor application are between EUR 0.20/m3 and EUR 0.30/m3 depending on the inhibitor quality. This corresponds to EUR 0.60/tonne of paper and EUR 0.90/tonne of paper produced, respectively. In the case of foodstuff packaging paper production, the inhibitor should have a certificate for its use in paper which is intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.\n\nOption b) The investment required for the lime trap related to the first year after installation amounts to about EUR 0.13/m3 treated effluent. For the described RCF paper mill that manufactures about 600 000 tonnes of Light-weight Coated (LWC) and white-coated Testliner per year, the costs are about EUR 850 000.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nHigh concentrations of dissolved calcium ions in the process water of the mills. Prevention of precipitation and scaling of calcium carbonates in the water systems, e.g. section rolls, wires, felts and shower nozzles, in heat exchanger systems and biological waste water treatment plants. The removal of calcium from process water allows mills processing paper for recycling with advanced water circuit closure to keep on using paper for recycling without reopening the water loops.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3882366_abstract", "x": 0.5466333, "y": 0.27209494, "title": "SOLID-LIQUID-SOLID HYDROMETALLURGICAL METHOD FOR THE SOLUBILIZATION OF METALS FROM SULFIDE COPPER MINERALS AND/OR CONCENTRATES", "year": 2021, "text": "The present invention relates to a solid-liquid-solid hydrometallurgical method in the presence of hydrated and/or non-hydrated salts in an oversaturation conditions, which is achieved by the intentional and repetitive application of drying and wetting steps, enhancing the chemical and physical phenomena on the mineral or concentrate, thus provoking the crystallization, re-crystallization, and release of copper in a nonstoichiometric decomposition of the sulfide and its subsequent precipitation with chloride.

Air emissions are of less importance and soil may be affected via waste disposal (composting, use of paper sludge in agriculture, landfilling). \n\nThe expected discharge of additives to water is directly related to the retention of the chemicals in the paper product, the degradability of the substances and the retention in the waste water treatment plant. The higher the retention, the lower the discharge to the effluent and the lower the potential environmental effect of the applied additives. In the case of product aids, a maximum degree of retention is desirable from an economic (loss of additives) and ecological point of view. Since product aids are designed to give paper a particular characteristic, for reasons of cost and efficiency they generally have a relatively high level of retention in the cellulose fibres. Process aids are usually not retained to the same extent because they produce their effect in the water circuits of the pulp and paper mills. A large proportion is discharged with waste water. Furthermore, it should be noted that broke is normally re-pulped so that some of the additives are returned to the water circuit. Knowledge of the retention of additives is therefore important. Knowing the degradability of a substance, on the other hand, is crucial to avoid the risk of accumulation of a given substance in the environment and organisms.\n\nSome water authorities use both the retention factors and the biodegradability of substances to assess and minimise the contribution of additives to the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load after treatment. In Germany, for example, the application of the method shown in Figure   2 .42 resulted in a reduced application and/or substitution of some of the additives that caused a significant share of the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load after treatment (substitution principle). Furthermore, the mill had to report how and why various chemicals had been used.\n\n\nFigure 2.42:\tPragmatic approach for assessment of the amount of not readily biodegradable additives to be expected in effluents from paper mills after treatment \n\n\nBesides a general approach for the reduction of releases of chemical additives to water, some candidates might exist for substitution/replacement from an environmental point of view. In particular, this might be the case when chemicals are considered hazardous and there are less hazardous substitutes available that can achieve the same purpose. Biodegradable, non-toxic and non-bioaccumulating chemicals should be favoured whenever possible. Chemicals suspected of posing a risk to humans or the environment should be avoided, e.g. those with ozone-depleting effects, suspected endocrine disruptors, CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic) substances. Hydrocarbons such as benzene (carcinogenic), toluene (toxic), and xylene (toxic) originating from solvents and detergents that might be used for the cleaning of wires, felts and machines should be replaced by solvents that show less toxic effects. Alternatives (e.g. esters), which are also to some extent biodegradable, are available.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA possible result of such an approach for the monitoring of additives might be similar to the one that is shown in Figure   2 .43. Some substances, mainly process aids, are not retained or biologically degraded (substance A). In this case the applied additives end up completely in the receiving water body. Others are partially retained and partially eliminated in the waste water treatment plant (substance B), while others are nearly 100 % retained and do not even reach the treatment plant. It can be assumed that most of the product aid additives are both partially retained and to a certain extent eliminated in the waste water treatment plant. Process aids have a low retention in cellulose fibres and can therefore be expected to end up in the waste water.\n\nFigure 2.43:\tSchematic presentation of the fate of chemical additives in paper manufacturing including external treatment \n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor chemical additives and auxiliaries, a 'transparent' information system is still missing in which manufacturers, importers and users of chemicals could carry out 'self-assessments' of chemicals for the life cycle stage that they are responsible for. Relevant data would then be passed from one company to the next to avoid the duplication of work. Some governments provide guidance and audit assessments of companies on chemicals, others also want companies to do more to improve the 'eco-efficiency' of chemicals manufacture, using fewer resources and emitting less residues per unit of product. An overview of the development and current state of selected environmental risk assessment schemes of substances is given in \n.\n\nSome non-exhaustive examples for positive experience with replacements of substances of concern are given in the following: \n\nUse of bio-dispersants instead of biocides as anti-slime and anti-deposit agents\nExample: RCF NL 1. The mill replaced biocides completely with slime dispersants to control the deposits of slime .\n\nSpecial features: relatively high temperatures in the process waters (up to 55degC), relatively low volume water circuits and tanks avoiding long dwelling times for bacteria growth, maximum avoidance of dead edges in the water and sewer systems and specific (lower) quality demands for RCF-based corrugating base paper that allow running small pits.\n\nConclusion: The possibility of avoiding biocides is mill-/product-specific. For those mills that can run the process under circumstances comparable to those described above, this could be a preferred production method. Biocides used for microbiological deposit control in paper mills often show relatively fast decomposition, are used in very low active concentrations and thus are difficult to detect in the final effluents; however biological decomposition efficiency can be affected, especially when anaerobic effluent treatment is carried out.\n\n\n\nUse of catalytic disinfection to remove germs and biofilms\nExamples: a) RCF DE 6, b) Papierfabrik Vreden GmbH, c) RCF DE 7, d) Hakle-Kimberly Deutschland GmbH [ German comments D 1 ].\n\nDescription: Using a solid metal catalyst and a hydrogen peroxide solution as an 'activator', microorganisms are killed by oxidation. Due to the positive charge of the catalyst the negatively charged microorganisms are drawn towards the catalyst, which will take electrons away from the microorganisms and thus partially destroy them. The remaining fragments and their biotenside properties will lead to a detachment of biofilms present in the water system. The biofilms in turn are then attracted by the catalyst and destroyed.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits:\nno formation of hydrogen sulphide or odour, organic acids or other toxic products,\nno microbiologically induced corrosion, \nno undesirable side effects for humans, the environment or materials,\nH2O2 is considerably less dangerous than other biocides.\n\nOperational data:\nCatalytic disinfection is permanently used in paper mills (examples a) to c), see Table   2 .26) with a paper output between 10 and 100 kt/yr and closed water loops (water volume: 700 - 1 000 m3, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 25 - 40 g/l, fresh water: 1 - 2 m3/t product). The consumption of aqueous 30% H2O2 solution in the first six months is 140 litres per week. The removed biolayer has to be separated. After the first six months the consumption of the solution is only 20 - 30 litres per week. The solution has to be dosed near the catalyst surface. Other biocides or other biocide methods are not necessary. In one case it was possible to halve the consumption of flocculants.\n\n\nTable 2.26:\tExample of mills using catalytic disinfection\n\n\nCatalytic disinfection is intermittently used in paper mills (example d)) with a paper output of 30 to 40 kt/yr and open water loops (water volume: 500 m3, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 2 g/l, fresh water: 12 m3/t product and waste water: 10 m3/t product). During the usage of catalytic disinfection the paper production is interrupted for several days, the water volume is reduced by 250 m3 and the water loop is closed. Several times a day the hydrogen peroxide solution (100 - 1 000 kg per dosage) is dosed near the catalyst. After the treatment the catalyst is removed from the water system and the water is changed. It is possible to use other biocides or other biocide methods during this temporary catalytic treatment. \n\n\n\nCross-media effects:\nThe dosage of 1 litre of solution requires 1 Wh. Side effects on air are not observed and not expected. As a result of the elimination of biolayers the redox potential increases in the water. Biotensides are adsorbed in the removed biolayer. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability:\nCatalytic disinfection is applicable for treatment of fresh water, circulating water, cooling water and in paper slurry. It is possible to install this in new or existing plants. \n\nEconomics:\nFor a paper output of 10 kt/yr in a closed water loop, 5 000 - 10 000 EUR/yr are required (write-off and operating). In an open water loop the costs are higher depending on the waste water volume. \n\nBy using the technique in an existing plant in the first year the consumption of the solution is considerably higher than in the following years. The costs for one temporary treatment are about 10 000 EUR.\n\nDriving force for implementation:\nImplementation of catalytic disinfection stops formation of toxic gases and odour, especially of hydrogen sulphide, and of microbiologically induced corrosion. Use of other biocides is not necessary. In some cases it was possible to reduce the consumption of flocculants. \n\nCross-media effects\nReduction of harmful additives in paper processing will result in less impact on water and waste compartments. It can also be beneficial from the perspective of life cycle management. By using environmentally sound product aids, harmful substances can be prevented from ending up in the product, which in turn might be used as a raw material in recovered fibre processing.\n\nEconomics\nNo data available.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSome water authorities set requirements to minimise the contribution of additives to the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load after treatment. Requirements for reduction of releases of biocides can also be found. Biodegradable, non-toxic and non-bioaccumulating chemicals should generally be favoured whenever possible. Chemicals suspected to pose a risk to humans or the environment should be avoided, especially those with ozone-depleting effects, suspected endocrine disruptors, and CMR substances.

The chloride efficiency is normally 60 - 70 %. In the washing zone, SO2 and particulates are removed. Scrubbing takes place at a pH of 6 - 7. The pH value is controlled with the addition of sodium hydroxide, weak liquor or oxidised white liquor. SO2 reacts with the scrubbing liquor and Na2SO3 and also some Na2SO4 are formed. Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) in the form of H2S can be removed together with SO2. However, to remove hydrogen sulphide from the flue-gases, a scrubbing liquor with a high pH would be required. At such a high pH, carbon dioxide would also be absorbed, which is unrealistic due to the relatively large amounts of carbon dioxide being formed in the combustion.\n\nSurplus liquor from the scrubber is recycled to the process, normally to the white liquor preparation.\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of sulphur emissions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWet scrubbers are used at about one third of the recovery boilers.\n\nHowever, if utilised, the reason is often also heat recovery. The removal efficiency of wet scrubbers for SO2 is typically >90 %. According to the data gathered, the same performance for SO2 reduction can be achieved by high dry solids content firing and by wet scrubbing the flue-gas.\n\nFor those mills that have higher SO2 emissions even when running the recovery boiler at a high dry solids content (e.g. because of boiler overload), a scrubber can be a measure to reduce these emissions.\n\nFigure   3 .111 shows the variation of emissions over a complete year. The data are taken from company's internal on-line measurement data. The fuels used in the recovery boiler are black liquor (approximately 75 % Dry Solids (DS)), strong malodorous gases (approximately 3 kg S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) and a mixture of turpentine and methanol. The washer in this example normally uses only water as the washing liquid; if the pH value in the water decreases to <7 (i.e. SO2 emissions would increase in the stack), NaOH is added to the scrubbing liquid in order to control the sulphur emissions. The annual average emission load of this mill in 2008 was 0.014 kg SO2/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (Source: questionnaire, 2008). Continuous SO2 measurement prior to and after the scrubber is needed to control the operation of the scrubber.\n\n\nFigure 3.111:\tContinuously measured daily average data of SO2 emissions of a kraft pulp recovery boiler equipped with an ESP and a scrubber\n\n\nCross-media effects\nBy introduction of fresh water in the top of the scrubber, hot water can be produced (if there is a need). The water is normally clean enough to be used as wash water in the bleach plant. The scrubber needs alkali in the form of oxidised white liquor, weak liquor or sodium hydroxide, which can increase the capacity demands on the recovery department.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nInstallation of a scrubber is preferably done at the same time a new boiler is installed, although at a much higher cost existing boilers can also be equipped with scrubbers. Recovery boilers burning high Dry Solids (DS) black liquor normally have very low-sulphur emissions, which makes the installation of the scrubber less beneficial. It can also be used for the further decrease of emissions of particulate matter or to recover heat.\n\nEconomics\nThe equipment usually comes as a package from the supplier. The investment required for a bleached kraft mill with a production capacity of 250 000 and 500 000 t/yr amounts to EUR 7.2 million and EUR 10.4 million respectively. It includes the scrubber, scrubber liquor pumps, circulation pumps, electrification and instrumentation. The operating costs amount to EUR 580 000 EUR/year and EUR 920 000/year.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of SO2 emissions. Heat recovery. Dust removal in some cases. In pulp mills that run the recovery boiler with a high Dry Solids (DS) content the SO2 emission can be substantially reduced and, for such mills, there is little need to install scrubbers. The internal energy situation of the mill might or might not require warm water production in the scrubber. In a modern kraft recovery boiler, especially if it operates on high Dry Solids (DS), the H2S is normally not a problem that needs scrubbing to resolve. Scrubbers can also be used as a second part of a two-stage dust removal facility (ESPs and wet scrubbers).\n\nExample plants\nScrubbers have been installed in numerous recovery boilers in Europe.\n\nReference literature\n, , . \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3461795_abstract", "x": 0.65836436, "y": 0.31924635, "title": "METHOD FOR BLEEDING OFF A SCRUBBER FLUID AND USE OF A BLEED-OFF CENTRIFUGAL SEPARATOR", "year": 2019, "text": "The present invention relates to a method for bleeding off a scrubber fluid containing a pollutant phase from a scrubber fluid loop.

The chloride efficiency is normally 60 - 70 %. In the washing zone, SO2 and particulates are removed. Scrubbing takes place at a pH of 6 - 7. The pH value is controlled with the addition of sodium hydroxide, weak liquor or oxidised white liquor. SO2 reacts with the scrubbing liquor and Na2SO3 and also some Na2SO4 are formed. Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) in the form of H2S can be removed together with SO2. However, to remove hydrogen sulphide from the flue-gases, a scrubbing liquor with a high pH would be required. At such a high pH, carbon dioxide would also be absorbed, which is unrealistic due to the relatively large amounts of carbon dioxide being formed in the combustion.\n\nSurplus liquor from the scrubber is recycled to the process, normally to the white liquor preparation.\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of sulphur emissions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWet scrubbers are used at about one third of the recovery boilers.\n\nHowever, if utilised, the reason is often also heat recovery.

The data are taken from company's internal on-line measurement data. The fuels used in the recovery boiler are black liquor (approximately 75 % Dry Solids (DS)), strong malodorous gases (approximately 3 kg S/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) and a mixture of turpentine and methanol. The washer in this example normally uses only water as the washing liquid; if the pH value in the water decreases to <7 (i.e. SO2 emissions would increase in the stack), NaOH is added to the scrubbing liquid in order to control the sulphur emissions.

The blockage state of the filtering device is determined by judging whether the overflow rate of the filtering device and/or a reduction rate of the liquid level height in the flocculation container is larger than a preset value, and the purpose of providing a basis for accurately judging whether a filter element of the filtering device needs to be cleaned or replaced is achieved.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"2.9.11.3.1\" title=\"Chemical precipitation\">\n<references_to>3.3.14, 7.3.12</references_to>\n\n<content>\nChemical precipitation\n\nDescription\nChemical flocculation of dissolved and suspended matter generates flocs that are separated by subsequent filtration or clarification.\n\nChemical precipitation involves the addition of chemicals to alter the physical state of dissolved and suspended solids and to create larger particles/flocs to facilitate their removal by sedimentation, or flotation.

The need for an abatement technique and, if so, which type is usually determined according to the pollution potential of the fuel and the combustion process. For instance, emissions of gaseous sulphur are low when only bark is burnt. In this case, no measure for SO2 reduction will be applied. \n\nIf mixtures of fuels including fossil fuels with variable pollution potential are burnt, the following measures to prevent and/or reduce SO2 emissions are available:\n\nUse of a low-sulphur fuel. \nUse of control techniques such as: \ninjection of lime or limestone for desulphurisation into the boiler (fluidised bed boilers);\nspray dry scrubbers;\nwet scrubbers (rarely used in the sector);\nother sorbent injection processes (e.g. active carbon).\n\nThe most common and often the most economical way to control SO2 in the pulp and paper industry is by using a low-sulphur fuel. Low-sulphur fuels contain from about 0.02 - 0.05 % weight sulphur (e.g. forest biomass, low-sulphur oil). Low-sulphur fuel oil with 0.05 % weight sulphur is available in many areas from several suppliers. The low-sulphur oil is also low in nitrogen (about 0.05 % by weight) and in ash (about 0.005 %) thus providing for low NOX and particulate emissions .\n\nIn fluidised bed boilers, the boiler ash already contains some calcium that binds sulphur present in the fuel. Additional SO2 reduction is obtained by lime injection into the boiler, by providing a calcium to sulphur ratio in the range of 1 - 3. A high calcium surplus provides up to 80 - 95 % sulphur removal to boiler ash, the higher removal being with Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB). Optimum sulphur capture takes place at around 850 degC burning temperature. The drawback of lime injection is the increased ash amount. In grate-fired boilers there is no efficient internal means of controlling SO2 emissions.\n\nExternal sulphur and SO2 removal methods can also be applied. Either wet or semi-wet methods, which both apply alkaline washing liquid to bind sulphur, or dry methods are available. Dry methods are less efficient than the enhanced control of fluidised bed burning, lime injection into the boiler or the external wet methods. Wet scrubbers are however only used in very few cases.\n\nDry and semi-dry processes are mainly used to separate minor pollutant loads. They mostly serve as waste gas cleaning plants for a variety of pollutants such as SO2, HCl, HF, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), heavy metals, PCDDs/PCDFs (the latter two groups of pollutants normally do not occur in significant concentrations in the pulp and paper sector). The facilities mainly consist of a dry reactor or spray absorber followed by an efficient particulate control device such as an ESP or fabric filter and some accessory facilities to manipulate adsorbents and separate dust.\n\nThe sorbent usually used is lime or calcium oxide. The lime slurry is sprayed into the flue-gas in a reactor vessel and water is evaporated by the heat of the flue-gas. The residence time (about 10 seconds) in the reactor is sufficient to allow for the SO2 and other acid gases such as SO3 and HCl to react with the hydrated lime to form a dry mixture of calcium sulphate/sulphite. Waste water treatment is not required in spray dry scrubbers because the water is completely evaporated in the spray dry absorber. The by-product also contains unreacted lime which may be recycled and mixed with fresh lime slurry to improve sorbent utilisation.\n\nSpray dry scrubbers in commercial use have achieved a removal efficiency of up to 90 % with some suppliers claiming >95 % SO2 removal efficiency is achievable. Apart from reducing the SO2 content of the flue-gas, the scrubber system also removes other acidic components such as HCl and HF.\n\nActive carbon can be added to the system and will remove mercury and organic compounds such as dioxins and furans. Active carbon may be required for co-incineration boilers.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe removal efficiency of using low-sulphur fuels depends on the previously used fuel. The secondary measures give reduction efficiencies in the range of 50 % to over 90 % depending on the method applied and operational conditions (AF Engineering file data, 2009). Both the primary and the secondary measures have a proven track record in the pulp and paper industry. In Table   2 .33 the achieved SO2 emissions for different fuels and emission control techniques are shown.

The spray dry scrubber is followed by a fabric filter to remove dust. If necessary, hydrated lime can also be dosed into the furnace.

The need for an abatement technique and, if so, which type is usually determined according to the pollution potential of the fuel and the combustion process. For instance, emissions of gaseous sulphur are low when only bark is burnt. In this case, no measure for SO2 reduction will be applied. \n\nIf mixtures of fuels including fossil fuels with variable pollution potential are burnt, the following measures to prevent and/or reduce SO2 emissions are available:\n\nUse of a low-sulphur fuel. \nUse of control techniques such as: \ninjection of lime or limestone for desulphurisation into the boiler (fluidised bed boilers);\nspray dry scrubbers;\nwet scrubbers (rarely used in the sector);\nother sorbent injection processes (e.g. active carbon).\n\nThe most common and often the most economical way to control SO2 in the pulp and paper industry is by using a low-sulphur fuel. Low-sulphur fuels contain from about 0.02 - 0.05 % weight sulphur (e.g. forest biomass, low-sulphur oil). Low-sulphur fuel oil with 0.05 % weight sulphur is available in many areas from several suppliers. The low-sulphur oil is also low in nitrogen (about 0.05 % by weight) and in ash (about 0.005 %) thus providing for low NOX and particulate emissions .\n\nIn fluidised bed boilers, the boiler ash already contains some calcium that binds sulphur present in the fuel. Additional SO2 reduction is obtained by lime injection into the boiler, by providing a calcium to sulphur ratio in the range of 1 - 3. A high calcium surplus provides up to 80 - 95 % sulphur removal to boiler ash, the higher removal being with Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB). Optimum sulphur capture takes place at around 850 degC burning temperature. The drawback of lime injection is the increased ash amount. In grate-fired boilers there is no efficient internal means of controlling SO2 emissions.\n\nExternal sulphur and SO2 removal methods can also be applied. Either wet or semi-wet methods, which both apply alkaline washing liquid to bind sulphur, or dry methods are available. Dry methods are less efficient than the enhanced control of fluidised bed burning, lime injection into the boiler or the external wet methods. Wet scrubbers are however only used in very few cases.\n\nDry and semi-dry processes are mainly used to separate minor pollutant loads. They mostly serve as waste gas cleaning plants for a variety of pollutants such as SO2, HCl, HF, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), heavy metals, PCDDs/PCDFs (the latter two groups of pollutants normally do not occur in significant concentrations in the pulp and paper sector). The facilities mainly consist of a dry reactor or spray absorber followed by an efficient particulate control device such as an ESP or fabric filter and some accessory facilities to manipulate adsorbents and separate dust.\n\nThe sorbent usually used is lime or calcium oxide. The lime slurry is sprayed into the flue-gas in a reactor vessel and water is evaporated by the heat of the flue-gas. The residence time (about 10 seconds) in the reactor is sufficient to allow for the SO2 and other acid gases such as SO3 and HCl to react with the hydrated lime to form a dry mixture of calcium sulphate/sulphite. Waste water treatment is not required in spray dry scrubbers because the water is completely evaporated in the spray dry absorber. The by-product also contains unreacted lime which may be recycled and mixed with fresh lime slurry to improve sorbent utilisation.\n\nSpray dry scrubbers in commercial use have achieved a removal efficiency of up to 90 % with some suppliers claiming >95 % SO2 removal efficiency is achievable.

There are various technical alternatives to replace fossil fuels in the lime kiln with biofuels:\n\ni)\tUse of bark powder in the lime kiln (e.g. KRAFT SE 1): The bark is dried, pulverised in a grinder and fired into a pulverised fuel burner.\nii)\tGasification of bark and use of the generated gas in the lime kiln (e.g. Sodra Varo, SE): The gasification system consists of a biofuel receiving station or fuel silo, a fuel screening and crushing section, a bark dryer, an air preheating section, a start-up burner and the gasifier itself. A gas line leads the pyrolysis gases from the gasified bark directly to the lime kiln. The bark to be gasified in the lime kiln gasifier should have a fuel moisture content of <15 % in order to avoid an extensive flue-gas flow that would limit the kiln capacity. A dryer is therefore needed in the system. The bark can be dried with excess secondary heat from the pulp mill.\n\nThe circulating fluidised bed gasifier is a refractory line reactor. The air required for gasification is introduced to the reactor through the bottom of the reactor. Due to the high velocity, the particles carry over into the cyclone where gas and the particles are separated. The gasifier operates at a temperature range of 600 - 700degC. Ash is removed from the bottom of the reactor.\n\nIn energy-efficient mills, bark is available to be used in the lime kiln, replacing fossil fuels because under normal operation bark is not needed for steam production. The steam generation from black liquor alone is higher than the process steam demand of the pulp mill.

In wet debarking 3 to 10 m3 of water per tonne of pulp are discharged. Organic compounds like resin acids, fatty acids, etc. and highly coloured materials leach out of the bark and into this waste water stream.\n\nIn dry debarking, process water is used only for log washing and de-icing (in cold climates water or steam is used for the thawing of wood) and is recirculated effectively with minimum generation of waste water and water pollutants. Dry debarking results in bark with a lower water content, which results in a better energy balance for the mill. Less water is needed in the debarking and the dissolved amount of organic substances is reduced. Spray water is used on the inlet of the debarking drum in order to reduce the dust emissions. Raw effluents from a debarking plant are toxic to aquatic life. Biological treatment has proven to be very efficient in eliminating toxicity. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and BOD load is significantly reduced compared to wet debarking (see Table   2 .25). \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of water consumption and of emissions of organic substances.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nDry debarking gives a very satisfactory debarking result for most types of wood and for all types of products. Debarking of certain eucalyptus species may be impossible if the logs have been stored after felling (dry or wet debarking present the same problems though).\n\nWith dry debarking, the wood handling waste water volume is usually in the range of \n0.5 - 2.5 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). A decrease in waste water amount is obtained by increased internal water circulation. By changing from wet debarking to dry debarking, the waste water amount often decreases by 5 - 10 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). With dry debarking, the total Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load can be reduced by up to 10 %. Typical discharges of dry debarking are shown in Table   2 .25. Note that the numbers refer to chemical pulping. The numbers per tonne of product will be approximately halved in cases of mechanical pulping due to the higher yield of mechanical softwood (spruce) pulps (> 90 - 95 %) than bleached Nordic soft- (44 - 46 %) and hardwood (47 - 49 %). Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) has yields of around 51 - 54 %.\n\nTable 2.25:\tPollution load of wet and dry debarking effluent before biological treatment\n\n\nCross-media effects\nEnergy consumption in debarking may increase due to the operation of the debarking drum in dry debarking mode. This is entirely offset by the substantial amount of energy gained if the bark is used as an auxiliary fuel due to the lower water content in bark from dry debarking. Better energy efficiency in the bark boiler results in a reduction of emissions per MJ of produced energy. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nDry debarking can be applied in both new and existing mills and for most debarking purposes (softwoods, hardwoods) and for all pulping processes (mechanical pulping, chemical pulping etc.). Dry debarkers already dominate the industry, and wet systems are in the process of being phased out. New mills almost exclusively and an increasing number of existing mills use dry debarking. However, owing to quality reasons wet debarking may be necessary when producing high brightness Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) bleached sulphite pulps.\n\nEconomics\nThe cost of a dry drum debarker does not differ significantly from a wet system. Typical investment costs of a completely new dry debarking system from log feed to conveyors (including the chipper and associated conveyors) is about EUR 15 million for a capacity of about 1 300 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) of kraft pulp per day (AF Engineering file data (2009)).\n\nThe conversion of an existing wet debarking system to a dry debarking system costs \nEUR 4 - 6 million. These costs include equipment and installation. Possible site-specific needs for new buildings, special noise abatement measures or similar are not included but they may further increase the costs. Operating costs are EUR 250 000 - 350 000 per year but in both cases it may involve considerable investment in equipment.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nDry debarking decreases Total Suspended Solids (TSS), BOD and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) loads as well as helping to reduce the amount of organic compounds like resin acids, fatty acids leaching out of the bark and into the waste water streams. Some of these substances are regarded as toxic to aquatic life. The measure also increases energy yield.\n\nExample plants\nMost plants in Europe.\n\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3162766_abstract", "x": 0.64243466, "y": 0.3265686, "title": "DISSOLVED AIR FLOTATION SYSTEM", "year": 2017, "text": "The present disclosure relates to a dissolved air flotation system using ambient air, and more particularly, to a dissolved air flotation system that is capable of allowing ambient air to be introduced in front of a pump to generate micro air bubbles with the water discharged from the pump, so that the ambient air may be used instead of compressed air.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"6.3.11\" title=\"Clarification of white water\">\n<referenced_by>6.3.2, 6.3.3, 7.1.3, 7.3.1, 7.3.4</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nClarification of white water \n\nDescription and achieved environmental benefits\nThe recycling of larger amounts of white water in paper recycling plants with deinking is only possible if there is a system for the clarification of white water. The systems for water clarification used almost exclusively in the paper industry are based on sedimentation, filtration (disc filter) and flotation. The best available technique at the time of writing (2013) is dissolved air flotation. Anionic trash and fines are agglomerated into physically treatable flocs by using additives. High-molecular, water-soluble polymers or inorganic electrolytes are used as flocculants. The generated agglomerates (flocs) are then floated off in the clarification basin. In dissolved air flotation (Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)), the suspended solid material is attached to air bubbles. These bubbles transport the material to the surface of a circular or rectangular basin where it is scraped off and fed to sludge dewatering and incineration. The clarified white water is taken out from the bottom (see Figure   6 .265).\n\n\nFigure 6.265:\tOperating principle of dissolved air flotation (Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF))\n\n\nIn a flotation system with a circular basin, the air bubbles are generated by mixing air into the circulation water at high pressure. When the pressure is reduced at the inlet of the basin, microscopic air bubbles are formed. The size of the bubbles is critical. Flocculation agents are usually added to the white water ahead of the flotation to improve separation. \n\nThe advantage of flotation is that, besides the removal of suspended material, small-size colloidal material can also be removed if appropriate Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) chemistry is applied. This is a great advantage in the paper recycling plants with deinking, where a large part of the solid material in the process water is colloid. In deinking systems, flotation is, at the time of writing (2013), the only way to purify the process water for recycling. In a deinking plant, the material is pumped to the sludge dewatering instead of being recycled in the process as in paper mills using virgin fibres.\n\nThe flotation systems generally give very pure water, but the efficiency is dependent on several factors, which have to be monitored and controlled, e.g. pH, volume flow, air bubble size and consistency flow. However, at optimum conditions the efficiency is very high. Another advantage of flotation is that the saturation of air (oxygen) in the process water creates less favourable conditions for the forming of anaerobic bacteria.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nBy use of Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) at a suitable position in the water loops, the degree of water loop closure can be continuously adjusted to the requirement of the process water quality depending on the concentration of anionic trash, additive consumption and product quality requirements.\n\nCross-media effects\nChemicals are needed as flocculants. Electricity is required mainly as pumping energy to saturate part of the untreated water, or a corresponding amount of clarified water, with air after raising the pressure to 7 bar. Floated sludge which has to be dewatered is generated.

The systems for water clarification used almost exclusively in the paper industry are based on sedimentation, filtration (disc filter) and flotation. The best available technique at the time of writing (2013) is dissolved air flotation. Anionic trash and fines are agglomerated into physically treatable flocs by using additives. High-molecular, water-soluble polymers or inorganic electrolytes are used as flocculants. The generated agglomerates (flocs) are then floated off in the clarification basin. In dissolved air flotation (Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)), the suspended solid material is attached to air bubbles. These bubbles transport the material to the surface of a circular or rectangular basin where it is scraped off and fed to sludge dewatering and incineration. The clarified white water is taken out from the bottom (see Figure   6 .265).\n\n\nFigure 6.265:\tOperating principle of dissolved air flotation (Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF))\n\n\nIn a flotation system with a circular basin, the air bubbles are generated by mixing air into the circulation water at high pressure. When the pressure is reduced at the inlet of the basin, microscopic air bubbles are formed. The size of the bubbles is critical. Flocculation agents are usually added to the white water ahead of the flotation to improve separation. \n\nThe advantage of flotation is that, besides the removal of suspended material, small-size colloidal material can also be removed if appropriate Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) chemistry is applied. This is a great advantage in the paper recycling plants with deinking, where a large part of the solid material in the process water is colloid. In deinking systems, flotation is, at the time of writing (2013), the only way to purify the process water for recycling. In a deinking plant, the material is pumped to the sludge dewatering instead of being recycled in the process as in paper mills using virgin fibres.\n\nThe flotation systems generally give very pure water, but the efficiency is dependent on several factors, which have to be monitored and controlled, e.g. pH, volume flow, air bubble size and consistency flow. However, at optimum conditions the efficiency is very high. Another advantage of flotation is that the saturation of air (oxygen) in the process water creates less favourable conditions for the forming of anaerobic bacteria.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nBy use of Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) at a suitable position in the water loops, the degree of water loop closure can be continuously adjusted to the requirement of the process water quality depending on the concentration of anionic trash, additive consumption and product quality requirements.\n\nCross-media effects\nChemicals are needed as flocculants. Electricity is required mainly as pumping energy to saturate part of the untreated water, or a corresponding amount of clarified water, with air after raising the pressure to 7 bar. Floated sludge which has to be dewatered is generated. The calorimetric value of the dewatered or dried sludge can be utilised for steam production in incinerators.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe measure can be adopted in new and existing recycled fibre mills.

Emissions of NOX can be reduced by 30 % to 70 % by the reaction between Nitric Oxide (NO) and the reducing agent to form nitrogen and water. The most common reagents used in Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) processes are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia and urea solution. In the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process, it is the ammonia molecule that is the active reducing agent. When using urea solution in such a deNOX process, the urea will be first converted into ammonia prior to the deNOX process. The dominating reaction in the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) processes in combustion processes where Nitric Oxide (NO) is the main NOX species is:\n\n\t\t\t4 Nitric Oxide (NO) + 4 NH3 + O2 - 4 N2 + 6 H2O.\n\nIn the more efficient Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process about 1 mole of ammonia is required per mole of NOX reduced or about 0.5 mole of urea per mole of NOX reduced. The Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process is not as efficient as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) when it comes to reagent utilisation. In this process, the reagents need to be dosed in an over-stoichiometric ratio. For Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) it can be in the range of 1.5 - 2 mole (or even higher in some cases). The approximate reagent consumption for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) processes is:\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR):\t1 kg NOX reduction requires 0.37 kg NH3 or 0.653 kg urea.\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR):\t1 kg NOX reduction requires 1.2 - 1.9 kg NH3 or 2.2 -3.3 kg urea.\n\nThe temperature window for efficient Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) operation is typically between 800 and 1 050 degC. When the reaction temperature increases to over 1 000 degC, the NOX removal rate decreases due to the thermal decomposition of ammonia. Below 800 degC, the NOX reduction rate decreases and ammonia slip may increase. The longer the reagent is in the optimum temperature window, the better the NOX reduction. Residence times in excess of one second yield optimum NOX reductions.\nAmmonia slip from the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems occurs either from injection at temperatures too low for effective reaction with NOX or from over-injection of the reagent. Controlling ammonia slip in Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems is difficult since there is no opportunity for effective feedback to control the reagent injection. Another difficulty is that the reagent should be placed where it is most effective and the NOX distribution varies within the boiler cross-section. \n\nDistribution of the reagent needs to be particularly controlled in larger boilers because of the long distance required to cover the cross-section of the boiler. Multiple points of injection are commonly used to follow the temperature changes caused by boiler load changes. In well-controlled Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems, NH3 emissions are in the range of 1 - 10 mg/Nm3 (see 'Environmental performance and operational data' and the LCP BREF).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR), a reduction of 30 % to 70 % is reported (AF Engineering file data, 2009). The result of the application of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is very sensitive to variations in the operational conditions of the boiler and the urea/ammonia dosing needs to be controlled permanently. Continuous NOX measurement should be carried out and experience shows reliable results.\n\nThe highest NOX reduction possible in a bark boiler is about 30 - 50 % and is achieved by changing the combustion techniques and/or by applying a Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process. The NOX emissions would then amount to 40 - 60 mg/MJ, equal to about 100 - 200 mg/Nm3. Achieved emission data for Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) applications in fluidised bed boilers can also be seen in Table   2 .30.\n\nFigure   2 .50 shows the measured daily average emission data (2009) of the bubbling fluidised bed boiler from KRAFT SE 1. The biomass boiler has a rated thermal input of 132 MWth. Fuels used are (expressed as energy input): 0.16 % light fuel oil; 2.07 % peat; 1.92 % waste from internal processing paper for recycling; 91.56 % bark, forest residuals and sawdust, and 4.29 % waste wood. The boiler is equipped with over fire air, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for NOX reduction and a bag filter with lime injection for the precoat layer for dust removal. Urea is injected in different sections and amounts into the boiler depending on the boiler load. The lime is only used as a precoat layer when new filters are introduced. Alkaline particles from the bark that is used as fuel have the same effect as injected lime. Nitric Oxide (NO) is measured on-line (additionally NO2 is measured once a year; for 2009 the share of NO2 in the total NOX (Nitric Oxide (NO) + NO2) was 7.4 %, i.e. 100 mg Nitric Oxide (NO)/Nm3 equals 108 mg NOX/Nm3). HCl was <1 mg HCl/Nm3 over the whole year. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) emissions varied between <1 mg/Nm3 and 5 mg/Nm3 over the year. \n\nFigure 2.50:\tDaily average emission data for the bubbling fluidised bed boiler equipped with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) from the KRAFT SE 1 pulp mill\n\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) on bark boilers is sometimes difficult to control because relatively fast changes of load can happen in bark boilers. This results in variations in the NOX reductions achieved by these techniques. Therefore, sometimes it is difficult to obtain a stable NOX reduction with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) in boilers with rapidly changing operational conditions.\n\nCross-media effects\nInjected urea or ammonia does not react completely but a small share of the reagent escapes in the flue-gas. The benefit of reduced Nitric Oxide (NO) should be weighed up against increased NH3 emissions and the ammonia slip controlled and kept as low as possible (see 'Environmental performance and operational data' below). Depending on the stoichiometry the urea is added, and a slight increase of ammonia (slip) may be detected but measurements demonstrate the risk to be marginal. \n\nA potential danger is unreacted ammonia combining with SO3 to form ammonium bisulphate. Ammonium bisulphate will precipitate at air heater operating temperatures and can ultimately lead to air heater fouling and plugging. If not properly controlled, there is a certain risk that a Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process may produce nitrous oxide (N2O), which contributes to the greenhouse effect. However, N2O emissions are more likely to occur at coal-fired boilers than at biomass-fired ones (see the LCP BREF).\n\nCO2 emissions associated with the use of urea and ammonia for NOX reduction are relatively small to negligible compared to the overall generation of CO2 in pulp and paper production. However, reduction of NOX emissions is required for health reasons and to protect the environment from adverse effects (such as eutrophication, acidification and ozone formation).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems are widely applied in different plants of different sectors and are a cost-effective measure to reduce NOX emissions to low levels. Installation in new plants is a common technique, and many existing fluidised bed reactors have been retrofitted with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). The optimal reaction conditions might be difficult to obtain in some existing boilers, thus limiting the potential NOX reduction to about 40 %.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment costs for installing the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique in boilers depending on the rated thermal input are reported as follows: 40 MWth: EUR 0.7 million; 60 MWth: EUR 0.8 million; 100 MWth: EUR 1 million . The investment includes injection equipment, pipes, pumps, tanks and rebuilding/adoption of the boiler. The operating costs mainly include the purchase of urea. About 1 - 2 kg urea is required per kg NOX removed.\n\nAnother estimation (AF Engineering file data, 2009) assumes the investment for Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for boilers in the range of 50 - 100 MWth to be around EUR 0.2 - 0.3 million. In addition the operational costs, mainly for ammonia, should be considered.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nIED (Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions) and LCP Directive (Directive 2001/80/EC) as well as national legislation. NOX has an acidifying potential and may increase eutrophication. In some sensitive lake areas in Europe a further reduction of NOX emissions by secondary measures such as Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is therefore regarded as necessary. Another driving force might be to meet the air quality objective and whether or not the national critical NOX loads according to the NEC Directive (Directive 2001/81/EC) are exceeded and additional measures for NOX removal required. A fee for NOX emissions in Sweden may also give an incentive for further NOX reduction. \n\nExample plants\nA number of facilities apply the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique on bark boilers, incinerators for deinking sludge and various types of fluidised bed boilers in SE, AT and DE. In Sweden Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) on bark boilers is an established technique.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n[ SEPA-Report 4008 ], [ SEPA-Report 4713-2, 1997 ].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4015062_abstract", "x": 0.6990863, "y": 0.21387798, "title": "METHOD OF CONTROLLING LANCES IN SNCR SYSTEM", "year": 2022, "text": "The invention relates to a method for controlling lances in a SNCR system, wherein the SNCR system comprises a plurality of lances, being configured to be distributed at different levels inside a boiler of the SNCR system and being configured to be capable of injecting reagents into the boiler to remove nitrogen oxides from nitrogen oxide containing flue gases, the method comprising: - collecting operating data, when the boiler is operating normally and the lance is opened in a random manner; - estimating, by means of a mathematical equation, nitrogen oxides level after an operation of the SNCR system, wherein the nitrogen oxides level in said mathematical equation is a function of initial nitrogen oxides emissions before operation of the SNCR system; - calibrating the mathematical equation using the collected data; and - optimizing the lance operation by means of the calibrated mathematical equation to determine the lances to be used and the amount of reagent to be injected in order to reduce the amount of reagent to be injected and/or to increase the removal of nitrogen oxides.

The optimal reaction conditions might be difficult to obtain in some existing boilers, thus limiting the potential NOX reduction to about 40 %.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment costs for installing the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique in boilers depending on the rated thermal input are reported as follows: 40 MWth: EUR 0.7 million; 60 MWth: EUR 0.8 million; 100 MWth: EUR 1 million . The investment includes injection equipment, pipes, pumps, tanks and rebuilding/adoption of the boiler. The operating costs mainly include the purchase of urea. About 1 - 2 kg urea is required per kg NOX removed.\n\nAnother estimation (AF Engineering file data, 2009) assumes the investment for Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for boilers in the range of 50 - 100 MWth to be around EUR 0.2 - 0.3 million.

Emissions of NOX can be reduced by 30 % to 70 % by the reaction between Nitric Oxide (NO) and the reducing agent to form nitrogen and water. The most common reagents used in Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) processes are anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia and urea solution. In the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process, it is the ammonia molecule that is the active reducing agent. When using urea solution in such a deNOX process, the urea will be first converted into ammonia prior to the deNOX process. The dominating reaction in the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) processes in combustion processes where Nitric Oxide (NO) is the main NOX species is:\n\n\t\t\t4 Nitric Oxide (NO) + 4 NH3 + O2 - 4 N2 + 6 H2O.\n\nIn the more efficient Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process about 1 mole of ammonia is required per mole of NOX reduced or about 0.5 mole of urea per mole of NOX reduced. The Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process is not as efficient as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) when it comes to reagent utilisation. In this process, the reagents need to be dosed in an over-stoichiometric ratio. For Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) it can be in the range of 1.5 - 2 mole (or even higher in some cases). The approximate reagent consumption for Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) processes is:\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR):\t1 kg NOX reduction requires 0.37 kg NH3 or 0.653 kg urea.\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR):\t1 kg NOX reduction requires 1.2 - 1.9 kg NH3 or 2.2 -3.3 kg urea.\n\nThe temperature window for efficient Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) operation is typically between 800 and 1 050 degC. When the reaction temperature increases to over 1 000 degC, the NOX removal rate decreases due to the thermal decomposition of ammonia. Below 800 degC, the NOX reduction rate decreases and ammonia slip may increase. The longer the reagent is in the optimum temperature window, the better the NOX reduction. Residence times in excess of one second yield optimum NOX reductions.\nAmmonia slip from the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems occurs either from injection at temperatures too low for effective reaction with NOX or from over-injection of the reagent. Controlling ammonia slip in Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems is difficult since there is no opportunity for effective feedback to control the reagent injection. Another difficulty is that the reagent should be placed where it is most effective and the NOX distribution varies within the boiler cross-section. \n\nDistribution of the reagent needs to be particularly controlled in larger boilers because of the long distance required to cover the cross-section of the boiler. Multiple points of injection are commonly used to follow the temperature changes caused by boiler load changes. In well-controlled Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems, NH3 emissions are in the range of 1 - 10 mg/Nm3 (see 'Environmental performance and operational data' and the LCP BREF).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR), a reduction of 30 % to 70 % is reported (AF Engineering file data, 2009). The result of the application of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is very sensitive to variations in the operational conditions of the boiler and the urea/ammonia dosing needs to be controlled permanently. Continuous NOX measurement should be carried out and experience shows reliable results.\n\nThe highest NOX reduction possible in a bark boiler is about 30 - 50 % and is achieved by changing the combustion techniques and/or by applying a Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process. The NOX emissions would then amount to 40 - 60 mg/MJ, equal to about 100 - 200 mg/Nm3. Achieved emission data for Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) applications in fluidised bed boilers can also be seen in Table   2 .30.\n\nFigure   2 .50 shows the measured daily average emission data (2009) of the bubbling fluidised bed boiler from KRAFT SE 1. The biomass boiler has a rated thermal input of 132 MWth. Fuels used are (expressed as energy input): 0.16 % light fuel oil; 2.07 % peat; 1.92 % waste from internal processing paper for recycling; 91.56 % bark, forest residuals and sawdust, and 4.29 % waste wood. The boiler is equipped with over fire air, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for NOX reduction and a bag filter with lime injection for the precoat layer for dust removal. Urea is injected in different sections and amounts into the boiler depending on the boiler load. The lime is only used as a precoat layer when new filters are introduced. Alkaline particles from the bark that is used as fuel have the same effect as injected lime. Nitric Oxide (NO) is measured on-line (additionally NO2 is measured once a year; for 2009 the share of NO2 in the total NOX (Nitric Oxide (NO) + NO2) was 7.4 %, i.e. 100 mg Nitric Oxide (NO)/Nm3 equals 108 mg NOX/Nm3). HCl was <1 mg HCl/Nm3 over the whole year. Total Organic Carbon (TOC) emissions varied between <1 mg/Nm3 and 5 mg/Nm3 over the year. \n\nFigure 2.50:\tDaily average emission data for the bubbling fluidised bed boiler equipped with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) from the KRAFT SE 1 pulp mill\n\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) on bark boilers is sometimes difficult to control because relatively fast changes of load can happen in bark boilers. This results in variations in the NOX reductions achieved by these techniques. Therefore, sometimes it is difficult to obtain a stable NOX reduction with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) in boilers with rapidly changing operational conditions.\n\nCross-media effects\nInjected urea or ammonia does not react completely but a small share of the reagent escapes in the flue-gas. The benefit of reduced Nitric Oxide (NO) should be weighed up against increased NH3 emissions and the ammonia slip controlled and kept as low as possible (see 'Environmental performance and operational data' below). Depending on the stoichiometry the urea is added, and a slight increase of ammonia (slip) may be detected but measurements demonstrate the risk to be marginal. \n\nA potential danger is unreacted ammonia combining with SO3 to form ammonium bisulphate. Ammonium bisulphate will precipitate at air heater operating temperatures and can ultimately lead to air heater fouling and plugging. If not properly controlled, there is a certain risk that a Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process may produce nitrous oxide (N2O), which contributes to the greenhouse effect. However, N2O emissions are more likely to occur at coal-fired boilers than at biomass-fired ones (see the LCP BREF).\n\nCO2 emissions associated with the use of urea and ammonia for NOX reduction are relatively small to negligible compared to the overall generation of CO2 in pulp and paper production. However, reduction of NOX emissions is required for health reasons and to protect the environment from adverse effects (such as eutrophication, acidification and ozone formation).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems are widely applied in different plants of different sectors and are a cost-effective measure to reduce NOX emissions to low levels.

In UASB and Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB) reactors sludge particles are kept fluidised by the upflowing influent. In Internal Circulation (IC) reactors, the gas produced in the system drives the circulation and mixing of liquid and solids in the reactor.\n\nThe main purpose of the different reactor concepts is to ensure a high concentration of biomass within the reactors. This is achieved either by recycling washed out biomass after settling in an external separator (contact reactor system), or by attaching the biomass to a supporting media within the reactor (fixed bed reactor) or through auto-immobilisation producing granular biomass (UASB and Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB) reactor). The reactors can be operated as single units or as modular combined units. \n\nAnaerobically treated waste water does not comply with requirements for the final Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and BOD concentration of the treated effluent. Therefore, anaerobic treatment is not normally used as a stand-alone treatment. The effluents of anaerobic systems are always post-treated by an aerobic biological stage.\n\nA simplified scheme of a combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plant is shown in Figure   2 .56 (for RCF-based graphic paper and tissue production, excess sludge cannot be fed back to the pulper or the mixing chest).\n\n\nFigure 2.56:\tSimplified scheme of a combined anaerobic-aerobic waste water treatment plant\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nAnaerobic pretreatment reduces the organic pollution load of waste water, reduces the excess sludge generated in comparison to stand-alone aerobic treatment and utilises the energetic content inherent in the organic pollution load (biogas production).\nEnvironmental performance and operational data \nCompared to stand-alone aerobic treatment plants, combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment plants have proved themselves to be more stable systems with respect to changing Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) loads and toxic or inhibiting substances in the process water. The availability of the plants is close to 100 %.\n\nFor an economically viable application of anaerobic techniques as a first stage of biological waste water treatment, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration of the process water should not be less than \n1 000 - 2 000 mg/l.\n\nDepending on the design of the anaerobic reactor suspended solids in concentrations above \n200 - 500 mg/l could cause problems in anaerobic systems, especially in fixed bed reactors. In some UASB reactors a slow disintegration of the biomass pellets was observed. In this case, the biomass can be replaced with new pellets from other UASB reactors in order to keep the reactor in effective operation. The anaerobic pretreatment considerably reduces the likelihood of bulky sludge developing in the subsequent aerobic stage.\n\nIn combined anaerobic-aerobic treatment plants, the energy demand related to the removal of 1 tonne of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (mainly used for pumping and aeration) is about 200 - 300 kWh, whereas in stand-alone and well-designed aerobic plants, the energy demand for the removal of 1 tonne of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) amounts to 500 - 600 kWh. The volume of biogas produced during anaerobic degradation ranges from 400 to 600 m3/tonne Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removed and consists of methane (60 - 75 %), CO2 \n(20 - 35 %) and small amounts of hydrogen sulphide. Before being used as fuel in mills' internal power plants as a substitution for fossil fuels, the biogas is desulphurised. Otherwise, corrosion problems and higher SO2 emission in the power plant occur.\n\nSince the calorific value of methane is 35.7 MJ/m3, the energy resulting from the thermal utilisation of biogas in a combined heat and power plant is in the range of \n1 900 - 2 900 kWh/tonne Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removed, assuming the efficiency of the power plant is 75 %. Energetic utilisation of biogas covers the total energy demand of the anaerobic-aerobic treatment plant. Part of the energy produced (about 70 - 80 %) can be used in other areas of the plant, e.g. for the paper production process.\n\nThe main parameter used to control the performance of anaerobic and aerobic waste water treatment techniques is the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), which is mostly analysed on a daily basis. For anaerobic systems, the biogas production rate, continuously measured by a gas meter, is another important control parameter, as well as the continuous measurement of the CO2, CH4, and H2S content of the biogas.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone reported.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nApplicable to new and existing plants. Upgrading an existing aerobic waste water treatment plant with an anaerobic pretreatment stage is normally feasible when the process water composition, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load and the sulphate content are suitable for anaerobic treatment. The retrofitting of an anaerobic pretreatment stage is a convenient measure when the aerobic stage has reached its maximum capacity and is probably overloaded. \n\nAnaerobic waste water treatment may require more attention and possibly changes with regard to the application of chemical additives (e.g. cleaning agents, defoamers, and slimicides) because anaerobic microorganisms are more sensitive to these chemical additives and toxic effects.\n\nInformation on cross-media effects, applicability, economics, driving force for implementation, example plants and reference literature for this technique is given in the sector-specific sections on anaerobic pretreatment (see sections 4.3.15 and 6.3.7).\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3333250_abstract", "x": 0.61953366, "y": 0.27813578, "title": "BIOREACTOR AND BIOGAS PRODUCTION METHOD", "year": 2018, "text": "The bioreactor of the present invention characterizes by having an additional aerobic-anaerobic camera (9) for biomass treatment arranged between the primary biomass preparation camera (1) and the main anaerobic camera (15).

The role of the sulphur entering the lime kiln with the lime mud is marginal but may lead to increased Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions in some cases (see Section 3.3.20.2). CaCO3 from the lime mud may absorb some SO2 but its absorption capacity is very limited. Additionally, a limited amount of sulphur can be absorbed in the lime kiln by gaseous sodium which is created by vaporising the remaining water-soluble alkali that the washed and dewatered lime mud fed to the kiln may still contain. These sulphur-absorbing alkali compounds in the lime mud are impurities of Na2CO3 that takes up some SO2 and forms sodium sulphate (Na2SO4).\n\nAlmost all lime kilns use heavy fuel oil or natural gas. In a few cases, tall oil, dry pulverised bark, sawdust or gas from a bark gasifier are used (further details on the use of regenerative biofuels are given in Section 3.3.23). More typical alternative fuels that are used only as part of the main fuel are non-condensable gases (Non-condensable Gases (NCG)), methanol and turpentine.\n\nSO2 emissions are significantly higher when strong non-condensable gases and/or condensate containing methanol are incinerated in the kiln and no scrubbers are used. \n\nWith properly dimensioned and operated lime mud washing and filtration, well-designed lime kiln burners and a sufficient air supply for complete combustion (the presence of sufficient excess air can be ensured by a residual oxygen control system), this does not increase the Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from the kiln.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced sulphur emissions.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data \nFigure   3 .128 (expressed as concentrations) and Figure   3 .129 (expressed as emission loads) summarise the achieved SO2 and Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from lime kilns of European kraft pulp mills. Some mills have only reported emission loads and no concentration values, others measure H2S and not Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) because Total Reduced Sulphur (TRS) emissions from lime kilns consist mainly of hydrogen sulphide. Because of the differences regarding the flue-gas flow, the SO2 concentration does not always correlate with the corresponding SO2 emission load.

At the time of writing (2013) the activated sludge method is the most common one and, if correctly designed, very effective. A BOD reduction of 98 % and a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction of 85 % can easily be reached. A drawback using this method is the fairly high concentrations of nutrients in the effluent. Therefore, some CTMP plants have had to complete the treatment with an additional chemical treatment (see Section 3.3.14).\nInternal chemical treatment of the white water of the first washing stage plus activated sludge treatment of the rest. There is one CTMP plant treating this white water with a chemical, which makes it possible to remove extractives and fines in a subsequent flotation stage. At the same time a 40 - 50 % Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction was reported. A drawback of this method is the fairly high chemical costs.\nCombination of an anaerobic and aerobic treatment of the waste water. There was only one plant in Sweden (SCA, Ostrand) using this technique. SCA Ostrand abandoned the anaerobic treatment. Instead the waste water from the softwood CTMP plant has been treated together with kraft pulp effluent aerobically since 2004. Evaporation of the most contaminated waste water and burning of the concentrate plus activated sludge treatment of the rest is another option. Worldwide, new evaporation techniques have been successfully implemented in a few mills which have the possibility to send the concentrates to a kraft pulp mill recovery system. In this case, the concentrate is burnt in a recovery boiler of an adjacent kraft pulp mill. The evaporation alternative is most suitable in such a case, when the pulp capacity has to be increased and the biological treatment plant is becoming too small. The clean condensate from such an evaporation plant can be used in the CTMP plant as process water, lowering the fresh water consumption considerably. Evaporation is also an alternative if tertiary treatment is considered necessary, i.e. in such cases where the nutrient concentrations in the effluent have to be lowered.\nEvaporation of all the effluents and incineration of the concentrates in a recovery boiler. This results in zero discharge of liquid effluents. The former Millar Western Pulp mill (Meadow Lake), in Saskatchewan, Canada, now produces up to 325 000 air dry tonnes (Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)) of bleached CTMP annually, well above its initial design capacity of 240 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). The mill commenced operations in 1992. The problem of effluent discharge to waterways was decisively dealt with by construction of a zero liquid effluent discharge facility. All of the process waste water is treated and 80 % is recycled as distilled water for reuse in the process. The remaining 20 % of the water is lost in the drying of the final pulp product, and by evaporation from effluent and treated water holding ponds. The effluent treatment system uses conventional evaporation, concentration and incineration unit operations. The CTMP mill converts aspen hardwood using the alkaline peroxide pulping (Alkaline Peroxide Pulping (APP)) process into the finest tissue and writing grade market pulp. Their zero effluent system is described below because it contains a number of innovations, which are of general interest for the sector. It has opened the door for use in other industrial applications where the receiving water body cannot effectively assimilate an industrial discharge.\n\nThe Meadow Lake water recycling system consists of the six unit operations which are shown in Figure   5 .217 and Figure   5 .218:\n\nsuspended solids removal (Krofta clarifiers including an option to use settling ponds);\nmechanical vapour recompression evaporation (1.5 times more capacity than the design flow rate to provide flexibility and catch up ability);\nsteam-driven concentration;\nconcentrate incineration;\ndistillate polishing for general mill usage;\ntreatment of lake water make-up. \n\nAs shown in Figure   5 .217, the only water that needs replacing is that which is lost through evaporation and is about 2 m3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.217:\tWater recycling system at the Meadow Lake BCTMP mill\n\n\nEvaporation technology is used to close the water loop and achieve zero effluent status \n. \n\nFigure   5 .218 shows the effluent process concept including major flows of the water through the various treatment steps.\n\nFigure 5.218:\tZero liquid effluent process concept at the Meadow Lake BCTMP mill\n\n\nAll process water streams are pumped to the primary treatment, which serves to remove suspended solids. Captured solids are dewatered and incinerated. Clarified water can be stored in outside ponds that provide reserve capacity between the pulp mill and the evaporators.\n\nClarified water is delivered to the mechanical vapour recompression (Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR)) evaporators where the concentration of total solids is increased from 2.5 % to 35 %. The distillate from the Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) evaporators is segregated into fractions internally to prevent contamination of the clean distillate, which account for 85 % of the distillate produced. The distillate fraction which has most of the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) is stripped of most of those organics in a steam stripper for incineration in the recovery boiler. Most of the evaporator distillate can be used directly in the pulp mill at 65 degC. However, some demands exist for water at 20 - 30 degC. To provide this, some of the distillate is cooled and the small fractions of volatile organics are removed in a biological stabilisation pond. \n\nThe solids level of the concentrate from the Mechanical Vapour Recompression (MVR) evaporators is increased to 70 % Dry Solids (DS) in two steam-driven concentrators and incinerated in a chemical recovery boiler. The smelt from the recovery furnace is cooled and solidified on a conveyor then deposited in a bunker.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe water recycling system causes no losses in pulp production and has no negative impact on pulp quality. The company has developed some unique methods of employee involvement in management decisions. Training was crucial to the successful start-up at Meadow Lake. New employees were given a minimum of three months of instruction in their positions before start-up was attempted. Ongoing coaching for skill development has kept the workforce at the cutting edge of technology and work practices. Safety at all costs has led to employee commitment to this essential programme that keeps morale high and insurance premiums low. Small teams are formed regularly and have the ability and authority to make changes to the process where benefits from such changes can be demonstrated.\n\nThe monitoring of the processes and the equipment is of the utmost importance in a zero effluent facility. Different testing programmes are running, such as the dynamic monitoring of fouling rates and corrosion and an ISO 9002 certified quality management system. These are supplemented by an analytical lab to keep a careful watch on the facility. One example is the metals monitoring programme which tracks ions in the system and permits proactive work to take place on corrosion, fouling and scaling.\n\nCross-media effects\nInformation on the energy balance compared to a conventional system was not available. The solid waste loop is not yet closed but in conventional systems it is not closed either. No other cross-media effects are known.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nClosing up the CTMP plant is possible for both new and existing mills. The limitation is the high capital cost of evaporation and the recovery boiler (as in Meadow Lake). The described concept was built for a greenfield mill in 1992 and requires a lot of space, which existing mills often do not have. The solution will depend on local conditions and is often different for market CTMP mills compared to integrated CTMP manufacturing. When using evaporators, the bleaching of CTMP has to be modified. For instance no sodium silicates can be used because of scaling.\n\nEconomics\nThe system has operating costs that are competitive with conventional bleached CTMP water and secondary effluent treatment systems. After the optimisation period, the effluent treatment operating costs at Meadow Lake are now below the cost of conventional secondary treatment. However, high investment costs for oversized evaporation and liberal sizing of the recovery plant and storage capacity for effluents (for three days) arose at the start-up phase. The attractiveness of the zero liquid discharge approach is augmented by potential chemical and energy recovery that can be used to reduce the cost of production and amortise capital costs. Data on specific costs are not available. Changes in aqueous effluent regulations do not effect zero effluent mills, which is an economic advantage.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nAt the Meadow Lake site water is scarce and the possible receiving water body is small. A conventional effluent treatment system would have necessitated the drilling of wells tapping into an underground aquifer to provide enough dilution water to thin the effluent discharge and keep the river flowing year round. This option was not acceptable to the owners of the company and the decision was made to pursue zero effluent technology. \n\nThe zero effluent concept may receive more acceptance in those cases where more strict effluent discharge limits have to be met. Besides solving the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) discharge problem, evaporation /incineration will allow a considerable reduction of fresh water use by the reuse of evaporator condensate, with the option to recover caustic when a causticising plant is added. The closing up of the chemical cycle will not only reduce the inorganic salts discharged to the receiving water body, but will also contribute to the reduction of operating costs.\n\nExample plants\nExamples are the BCTMP pulp mill in Meadow Lake and the Tembec Chetwynd BCTMP pulp mill in Canada, Stora Enso Fors (Sweden), M-Real Joutseno and Kaskinen (Finland), Klabin (Brazil), and Sun Paper Yanzhou (China).\n\nReference literature\n, , , , \n, . \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4039356_abstract", "x": 0.6816212, "y": 0.1983738, "title": "EXHAUST GAS PURIFICATION DEVICE", "year": 2022, "text": "Provided are a selective reducing catalyst, an exhaust gas purification apparatus and the like with excellent NOx removal performance and economic efficiency, which involve relatively low cost per unit catalyst coating mass, and have improved NOx removal performance under a condition of a relatively low to relatively high amount of ammonia adsorbed.

For the reduction of NOX, no catalytic converter is necessary. Therefore, this process is called 'selective non-catalytic reduction' (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)). There are no applications of 'selective catalytic reduction' (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) in recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills in the European paper industry although technically it should be possible.\n\nAn installation for Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for a sulphite pulp recovery boiler consists of a storage and dosage station for the reducing agents (NH3 or urea), supply pipes, devices for the injection of the reactant into the suitable zone of the recovery boiler and the reaction zone where the reduction of NOX takes place. If an existing recovery boiler is retrofitted with the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique, the combustion chamber needs to be adapted accordingly: tiny holes have to be drilled for the ammonia water inlets and lances and pipes installed. The injected ammonia reacts with Nitric Oxide (NO) to N2 and water. A minor percentage may leave the reaction zone as unwanted ammonia emissions (the 'ammonia slip'). The injection of NH3 must be done at an appropriate stage, just where the optimum temperature window (in the example mill below at 910 - 920 degC) can be found (see Figure   4 .194). \n\nFigure 4.194:\tSchematic view of the ammonia injection into the recovery boiler \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique allows for reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides by adding a reducing agent (ammonia water or urea). Further details are presented under the heading 'Environmental performance and operational data' further below (AT, SE).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe examples below present details of practical experience with this technique. The operation and efficiency of the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique on sulphite pulp mill recovery boilers vary to a certain extent between the mills that have implemented this technique. There are differences in terms of the reducing agents used, the dosage and the target values to be achieved. However, in all known cases the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique meets the expected results and is running without technical problems. It is considered a stable process.\n\nExample: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill operates with the acid bisulphite pulping process. The net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). Only wood chips are used, and the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir. The base used is magnesium oxide, the year of construction of the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique is 1993/94, and the gas flow is around 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to around 880 000 Nm3/day. A minor amount of raw gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/d), and the rated thermal input is 21.5 MWth. Besides the concentrated spent liquor, biosludge from the waste water treatment plant is also incinerated in the recovery boiler (60 - 70 tonnes of biosludge per day at 4 - 6 % dry solids content; the sludge is dewatered by presses and centrifugal decanters to about 20 % Dry Solids (DS)). The share of biomass of the total mass incinerated in the recovery boiler is around 4 - 6 %. Around 9.5 m3 of concentrated liquor are burnt per hour (including biosludge) in the recovery boiler.\n\nii) Operational experience\nSome changes have been made to the recovery boiler for the injection of the diluted ammonia: some tiny holes had to be drilled for the ammonia water inlet and supply pipes were installed (see Figure   4 .194 above). The ammonia is transferred to a double-walled storage tank by a gas displacement device. The mill was already handling ammonia, as ammonia is also used for conditioning the boiler feed water. From the storage tank for liquefied ammonia (25 %), the reducing agent is mixed with deionised water to a 10 - 11 % solution of ammonia water. The mixture is injected into the combustion chamber at 910 - 920 degC. The dosing of NH3 water is determined by the continuously measured NOX target value which depends on the requirements set by the competent authority. The current dosage is around 50 l/h at an average flue-gas flow of 35 000 - 37 000 Nm3/h (approximately 1.5 ml of NH3/Nm3). No negative effects on the chemical recovery cycle have been observed during more than 10 years of operation.\n\niii) Achieved performance: The NOX concentration in the flue-gas of the recovery boiler of the example mill is higher than in other mills because biosludge from the waste water treatment plant is also incinerated in the recovery boiler. In 1994, the performance of the new installation was tested after the start-up of operation by TUV Bayern, Austria. Before 1994, i.e. without adding the biosludge to the recovery boiler, the concentration of NOX in the off-gas of the recovery boiler had been determined as being around 220 mg/Nm3 (5 % O2). When the concentrated spent liquor was burnt together with 4.5 % biosludge, the NOX emissions were around 340 - 350 mg of NOX (as NO2)/Nm3 (5 % oxygen content, normal operating conditions, dry gas). By injection of around 80 l of ammonia water per hour, the average concentration could be lowered to about 185 mg of NOX/Nm3. The CO concentration was around 30 mg/Nm3 (5 % O2) at that time. At this dosage, no relevant ammonia slip was determined (<1 mg NH3/Nm3), .\n\nIn order to operate well below the current limit value and to save chemical costs, today the NOX target value is 250 mg/Nm3 (5 % O2). To reach this level, around 50 l of NH3 per hour are injected into the recovery boiler (this corresponds to around 8 - 9 l of NH3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). Test results and practical experience have shown that even lower values could be achieved \n: 185 mg NOX/Nm3 at 5 % O2 at an ammonia dosage of around 80 l/h without detecting a relevant ammonia slip.\n\nNormally, the variation of NOX is very low and there are only small fluctuations of around 270 mg/Nm3, e.g. during soot blowing of the superheater surfaces (see Figure   4 .195). In Figure   4 .195, the peak in August is caused by a failure of the measurement device. In one day during December, the ammonia dosing was interrupted so the emission without Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) can be seen (around 370 mg/Nm3). In April and October, three days of regular maintenance shutdown of the recovery boiler can be seen. Lower peaks occur when less concentrated liquor and more natural gas is fired.\n\nFigure 4.195:\tDaily mean NOX emissions from the recovery boiler as determined by the automatic emission monitoring system during 2008 \n\n\nNOX and CO are measured continuously by automatic NOX (chemiluminescence) and CO analysers (infrared absorption). The ammonia slip is measured periodically once every three years by an external auditor (e.g. in March 2009 measurement results were 0.3 mg of NH3/Nm3; in 2006, 0.4 mg of NH3/Nm3 was determined according to ONORM M 6242).\n\nThe emissions of NOX expressed as a yearly average are currently 262 mg of NO2/Nm3 (at 5 % O2) which corresponds to 1.68 kg of NOX/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) with ammonia injection. Without ammonia injection the emissions of NOX would be around 20 - 30 % higher.\n\nTable   4 .102 summarises the measured emission levels achieved by the use of ammonia injection (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) that were reported in the emission declaration of 2008. For the ammonia slip, the competent authority set a limit value of 10 mg of NH3/Nm3; the measured values were always below 1 mg of NH3/Nm3 (measured according to VDI guideline 3496).\n\nTable 4.102:\tMeasured NOX and CO emissions of an Austrian sulphite pulp mill recovery boiler (21.5 MWth) \n\n\nThere is another Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) application in the two recovery boilers of the Stora Enso Nymolla sulphite pulp mill in Sweden. The mill is running the recovery boilers at high capacity. For the NOX reduction, a 35 % solution of urea with additives (organic amines) is injected into the recovery boilers. These chemicals are easier and safer to handle but also more expensive than ammonia. Around 7 - 8 kg of urea solution/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) are added to the recovery boilers which reduces the concentration of NOX in the flue-gases by around 20 - 30 %. Experience had shown that adding more urea would not lead to lower values. NOX and CO are measured continuously and reported to the mill information system. The yearly average value of NOX in the flue-gases from the minor recovery boiler is 150 ppm (or 308 mg/Nm3). The NOX value from the major boiler is 115 ppm (or 236 mg/Nm3) with the O2 content not reported.\n\nIf no urea solution had been used, the concentrations would be estimated to be 370 - 400 mg of NOX/Nm3 and 287 - 308 mg of NOX/Nm3 respectively. That means that if the dosage of the reducing agent is stopped, the NOX emissions increase about 20 - 30 %. The possible ammonia slip is measured periodically by external auditors. The value has always been below the detection limit. \n\nCross-media effects\nThere are no solid or liquid residues generated by the use of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). A chemical as a reducing agent is needed for the reduction of NOX. In the case of Mondi Neusiedler, in 2008 on average 3 000 kg of ammonia per month (at 25 %) were injected into the recovery boiler which adds up to 34 tonnes of NH3/year (at 25 %) to bring the NOX level from around 320 mg/Nm3 down to 250 - 260 mg/Nm3 (at 5 % O2). This corresponds to a reduction of around 60 mg of NOX/Nm3. At a daily flue-gas flow of 880 000 Nm3/day, around 53 kg of NOX/day or around 19 tonnes of NOX/year are reduced. That means a ratio of ammonia input to NOX reduced of around 1.8 is applied, or for the reduction of 1 kg of NOX in the flue-gas 1.8 kg of NH3 (ammonia, 25 % of which is diluted to approximately 10 - 11 %) is needed.\n\nThe efficiency of the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique is circumscribed by the unwanted 'ammonia slip' in the flue-gas which is normally limited by the air protection legislation and by the costs for the ammonia that has to be injected into the recovery boiler. In order to keep the ammonia slip as low as possible, a high NH3:NOX ratio is avoided. In the case of Mondi Neusiedler (ammonia reduction to a target value of 250 mg of NOX/Nm3), a limit value of 10 mg/Nm3 for NH3 slip has been set by the competent authority. During periodic measurements, no relevant NH3 emissions have been measured, i.e. emission levels are normally below 1 mg of NH3/Nm3 (e.g. in March 2009, 0.3 mg of NH3/Nm3 was measured). Relevant ammonia slip was also not detected during test periods or special operating conditions during which for a limited period of time the NOX emission levels were lowered from around 330 - 350 mg/Nm3 down to 180 - 170 mg/Nm3 by ammonia injection which corresponds to a NOX reduction rate of about 50 %.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nRetrofitting of existing recovery boilers may be limited due to scaling problems and associated increased cleaning and maintenance requirements. For ammonium-based mills, no application was reported but, due to specific conditions in the waste gas, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is not expected to have any effect. Not applicable to sodium-based mills due to the explosion risk.\n\nEconomics\nIn 1994, investment costs for the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) equipment were EUR 250 000. In 2009, investment costs were estimated to EUR 400 000. As the process was considered innovative in 1993, the example mill in AT received around 30 % environmental subsidies for the project. Operational costs are around EUR 2 000 - 3 000 of maintenance costs per year and around EUR 5 500 per year for ammonia (1 tonne of NH3 25 % cost around EUR 157 in 2008). With regard to the manufactured tonne of pulp, the operating costs are in the range of EUR 0.15/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe example mill did not operate a bark boiler because only sawmill residues were used for pulping. Therefore, it was planned to burn the dewatered biosludge from the waste water treatment plant together with the concentrated spent liquor in the recovery boiler. This would have caused higher NOX emissions. The competent authority asked the company to reduce the NOX emissions. In 1993, the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) project was realised together with incineration of the dewatered biosludge in the recovery boiler. Example Mill 2 in SE is running the recovery boilers at the maximum design capacity at high temperatures. The competent authorities asked them to implement NOX reduction measures more than 10 years ago.\n\nExample plants\nMondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff, AT, Stora Enso Nymolla, SE, and Sappi Ehingen, DE, have applied Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) on one of the two recovery boilers.\n\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3517750_abstract", "x": 0.70340705, "y": 0.20973833, "title": "ENGINE EXHAUST PURIFICATION CONTROL DEVICE", "year": 2019, "text": "An NH3 supply amount controller reduces and adjusts a supply amount of NH3 to an SCR catalyst by an NH3 supplier, when an exhaust gas flowing into an NOx catalyst has a rich air-fuel ratio and NOx occluded by the NOx catalyst is reduced to N2.

For the ammonia slip, the competent authority set a limit value of 10 mg of NH3/Nm3; the measured values were always below 1 mg of NH3/Nm3 (measured according to VDI guideline 3496).\n\nTable 4.102:\tMeasured NOX and CO emissions of an Austrian sulphite pulp mill recovery boiler (21.5 MWth) \n\n\nThere is another Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) application in the two recovery boilers of the Stora Enso Nymolla sulphite pulp mill in Sweden. The mill is running the recovery boilers at high capacity. For the NOX reduction, a 35 % solution of urea with additives (organic amines) is injected into the recovery boilers. These chemicals are easier and safer to handle but also more expensive than ammonia. Around 7 - 8 kg of urea solution/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) are added to the recovery boilers which reduces the concentration of NOX in the flue-gases by around 20 - 30 %. Experience had shown that adding more urea would not lead to lower values. NOX and CO are measured continuously and reported to the mill information system. The yearly average value of NOX in the flue-gases from the minor recovery boiler is 150 ppm (or 308 mg/Nm3). The NOX value from the major boiler is 115 ppm (or 236 mg/Nm3) with the O2 content not reported.\n\nIf no urea solution had been used, the concentrations would be estimated to be 370 - 400 mg of NOX/Nm3 and 287 - 308 mg of NOX/Nm3 respectively. That means that if the dosage of the reducing agent is stopped, the NOX emissions increase about 20 - 30 %. The possible ammonia slip is measured periodically by external auditors. The value has always been below the detection limit. \n\nCross-media effects\nThere are no solid or liquid residues generated by the use of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). A chemical as a reducing agent is needed for the reduction of NOX. In the case of Mondi Neusiedler, in 2008 on average 3 000 kg of ammonia per month (at 25 %) were injected into the recovery boiler which adds up to 34 tonnes of NH3/year (at 25 %) to bring the NOX level from around 320 mg/Nm3 down to 250 - 260 mg/Nm3 (at 5 % O2). This corresponds to a reduction of around 60 mg of NOX/Nm3. At a daily flue-gas flow of 880 000 Nm3/day, around 53 kg of NOX/day or around 19 tonnes of NOX/year are reduced. That means a ratio of ammonia input to NOX reduced of around 1.8 is applied, or for the reduction of 1 kg of NOX in the flue-gas 1.8 kg of NH3 (ammonia, 25 % of which is diluted to approximately 10 - 11 %) is needed.\n\nThe efficiency of the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique is circumscribed by the unwanted 'ammonia slip' in the flue-gas which is normally limited by the air protection legislation and by the costs for the ammonia that has to be injected into the recovery boiler. In order to keep the ammonia slip as low as possible, a high NH3:NOX ratio is avoided. In the case of Mondi Neusiedler (ammonia reduction to a target value of 250 mg of NOX/Nm3), a limit value of 10 mg/Nm3 for NH3 slip has been set by the competent authority. During periodic measurements, no relevant NH3 emissions have been measured, i.e. emission levels are normally below 1 mg of NH3/Nm3 (e.g. in March 2009, 0.3 mg of NH3/Nm3 was measured). Relevant ammonia slip was also not detected during test periods or special operating conditions during which for a limited period of time the NOX emission levels were lowered from around 330 - 350 mg/Nm3 down to 180 - 170 mg/Nm3 by ammonia injection which corresponds to a NOX reduction rate of about 50 %.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nRetrofitting of existing recovery boilers may be limited due to scaling problems and associated increased cleaning and maintenance requirements. For ammonium-based mills, no application was reported but, due to specific conditions in the waste gas, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is not expected to have any effect. Not applicable to sodium-based mills due to the explosion risk.\n\nEconomics\nIn 1994, investment costs for the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) equipment were EUR 250 000. In 2009, investment costs were estimated to EUR 400 000. As the process was considered innovative in 1993, the example mill in AT received around 30 % environmental subsidies for the project. Operational costs are around EUR 2 000 - 3 000 of maintenance costs per year and around EUR 5 500 per year for ammonia (1 tonne of NH3 25 % cost around EUR 157 in 2008). With regard to the manufactured tonne of pulp, the operating costs are in the range of EUR 0.15/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe example mill did not operate a bark boiler because only sawmill residues were used for pulping. Therefore, it was planned to burn the dewatered biosludge from the waste water treatment plant together with the concentrated spent liquor in the recovery boiler. This would have caused higher NOX emissions. The competent authority asked the company to reduce the NOX emissions. In 1993, the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) project was realised together with incineration of the dewatered biosludge in the recovery boiler. Example Mill 2 in SE is running the recovery boilers at the maximum design capacity at high temperatures. The competent authorities asked them to implement NOX reduction measures more than 10 years ago.\n\nExample plants\nMondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff, AT, Stora Enso Nymolla, SE, and Sappi Ehingen, DE, have applied Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) on one of the two recovery boilers.\n\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3524788_abstract", "x": 0.70457476, "y": 0.21022797, "title": "ENGINE EXHAUST PURIFICATION CONTROL DEVICE", "year": 2019, "text": "An NH3 supply amount controller reduces and adjusts a supply amount of NH3 to an SCR catalyst by an NH3 supplier, when an exhaust gas flowing into an NOx catalyst has a rich air-fuel ratio and NOx occluded by the NOx catalyst is reduced to N2.

For the reduction of NOX, no catalytic converter is necessary. Therefore, this process is called 'selective non-catalytic reduction' (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)). There are no applications of 'selective catalytic reduction' (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) in recovery boilers of sulphite pulp mills in the European paper industry although technically it should be possible.\n\nAn installation for Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) for a sulphite pulp recovery boiler consists of a storage and dosage station for the reducing agents (NH3 or urea), supply pipes, devices for the injection of the reactant into the suitable zone of the recovery boiler and the reaction zone where the reduction of NOX takes place. If an existing recovery boiler is retrofitted with the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique, the combustion chamber needs to be adapted accordingly: tiny holes have to be drilled for the ammonia water inlets and lances and pipes installed. The injected ammonia reacts with Nitric Oxide (NO) to N2 and water. A minor percentage may leave the reaction zone as unwanted ammonia emissions (the 'ammonia slip'). The injection of NH3 must be done at an appropriate stage, just where the optimum temperature window (in the example mill below at 910 - 920 degC) can be found (see Figure   4 .194). \n\nFigure 4.194:\tSchematic view of the ammonia injection into the recovery boiler \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique allows for reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides by adding a reducing agent (ammonia water or urea). Further details are presented under the heading 'Environmental performance and operational data' further below (AT, SE).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe examples below present details of practical experience with this technique. The operation and efficiency of the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique on sulphite pulp mill recovery boilers vary to a certain extent between the mills that have implemented this technique. There are differences in terms of the reducing agents used, the dosage and the target values to be achieved. However, in all known cases the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique meets the expected results and is running without technical problems. It is considered a stable process.\n\nExample: Mondi Neusiedler GmbH and Ybbstaler Zellstoff GmbH\n\ni) Basic data\nThe mill operates with the acid bisulphite pulping process. The net production of pulp in 2008 was 50 000 Air Dry Tonnes (ADt). Only wood chips are used, and the percentage of wood species used is 98 % spruce and 2 % fir. The base used is magnesium oxide, the year of construction of the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) technique is 1993/94, and the gas flow is around 6 600 Nm3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (dry, normal operating conditions) which corresponds to around 880 000 Nm3/day. A minor amount of raw gas is added to the flame to support combustion (1 500 Nm3/d), and the rated thermal input is 21.5 MWth. Besides the concentrated spent liquor, biosludge from the waste water treatment plant is also incinerated in the recovery boiler (60 - 70 tonnes of biosludge per day at 4 - 6 % dry solids content; the sludge is dewatered by presses and centrifugal decanters to about 20 % Dry Solids (DS)). The share of biomass of the total mass incinerated in the recovery boiler is around 4 - 6 %. Around 9.5 m3 of concentrated liquor are burnt per hour (including biosludge) in the recovery boiler.\n\nii) Operational experience\nSome changes have been made to the recovery boiler for the injection of the diluted ammonia: some tiny holes had to be drilled for the ammonia water inlet and supply pipes were installed (see Figure   4 .194 above). The ammonia is transferred to a double-walled storage tank by a gas displacement device. The mill was already handling ammonia, as ammonia is also used for conditioning the boiler feed water. From the storage tank for liquefied ammonia (25 %), the reducing agent is mixed with deionised water to a 10 - 11 % solution of ammonia water. The mixture is injected into the combustion chamber at 910 - 920 degC. The dosing of NH3 water is determined by the continuously measured NOX target value which depends on the requirements set by the competent authority. The current dosage is around 50 l/h at an average flue-gas flow of 35 000 - 37 000 Nm3/h (approximately 1.5 ml of NH3/Nm3). No negative effects on the chemical recovery cycle have been observed during more than 10 years of operation.\n\niii) Achieved performance: The NOX concentration in the flue-gas of the recovery boiler of the example mill is higher than in other mills because biosludge from the waste water treatment plant is also incinerated in the recovery boiler. In 1994, the performance of the new installation was tested after the start-up of operation by TUV Bayern, Austria. Before 1994, i.e. without adding the biosludge to the recovery boiler, the concentration of NOX in the off-gas of the recovery boiler had been determined as being around 220 mg/Nm3 (5 % O2). When the concentrated spent liquor was burnt together with 4.5 % biosludge, the NOX emissions were around 340 - 350 mg of NOX (as NO2)/Nm3 (5 % oxygen content, normal operating conditions, dry gas). By injection of around 80 l of ammonia water per hour, the average concentration could be lowered to about 185 mg of NOX/Nm3. The CO concentration was around 30 mg/Nm3 (5 % O2) at that time. At this dosage, no relevant ammonia slip was determined (<1 mg NH3/Nm3), .\n\nIn order to operate well below the current limit value and to save chemical costs, today the NOX target value is 250 mg/Nm3 (5 % O2). To reach this level, around 50 l of NH3 per hour are injected into the recovery boiler (this corresponds to around 8 - 9 l of NH3/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt)). Test results and practical experience have shown that even lower values could be achieved \n: 185 mg NOX/Nm3 at 5 % O2 at an ammonia dosage of around 80 l/h without detecting a relevant ammonia slip.\n\nNormally, the variation of NOX is very low and there are only small fluctuations of around 270 mg/Nm3, e.g. during soot blowing of the superheater surfaces (see Figure   4 .195). In Figure   4 .195, the peak in August is caused by a failure of the measurement device. In one day during December, the ammonia dosing was interrupted so the emission without Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) can be seen (around 370 mg/Nm3). In April and October, three days of regular maintenance shutdown of the recovery boiler can be seen. Lower peaks occur when less concentrated liquor and more natural gas is fired.\n\nFigure 4.195:\tDaily mean NOX emissions from the recovery boiler as determined by the automatic emission monitoring system during 2008 \n\n\nNOX and CO are measured continuously by automatic NOX (chemiluminescence) and CO analysers (infrared absorption). The ammonia slip is measured periodically once every three years by an external auditor (e.g. in March 2009 measurement results were 0.3 mg of NH3/Nm3; in 2006, 0.4 mg of NH3/Nm3 was determined according to ONORM M 6242).\n\nThe emissions of NOX expressed as a yearly average are currently 262 mg of NO2/Nm3 (at 5 % O2) which corresponds to 1.68 kg of NOX/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) with ammonia injection. Without ammonia injection the emissions of NOX would be around 20 - 30 % higher.\n\nTable   4 .102 summarises the measured emission levels achieved by the use of ammonia injection (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) that were reported in the emission declaration of 2008. For the ammonia slip, the competent authority set a limit value of 10 mg of NH3/Nm3; the measured values were always below 1 mg of NH3/Nm3 (measured according to VDI guideline 3496).\n\nTable 4.102:\tMeasured NOX and CO emissions of an Austrian sulphite pulp mill recovery boiler (21.5 MWth) \n\n\nThere is another Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) application in the two recovery boilers of the Stora Enso Nymolla sulphite pulp mill in Sweden.

After biodegradation, biomass and water are separated normally using sedimentation tanks (clarification may be enhanced by flocculation etc.). Different process designs are available, which can be classified in two main categories: activated sludge systems (such as one- or two-stage activated sludge plants or aerated lagoons) and biofilm systems (such as moving bed biofilm reactors (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)) or membrane bioreactors (MBR)). A combination of biofilm and activated sludge systems is also used.\n\na) Activated sludge process \nThe activated sludge plant consists of two main units, the aeration basin and the secondary clarifier (sedimentation basin). In the aeration basin, the effluent is treated with a culture of microorganisms (the activated sludge), which are present in a high concentration. The sludge is separated from the water in the clarifier. Most of the sludge is recycled to the aeration basin, which is necessary for keeping the sludge concentration high. A small part of the sludge, corresponding to the net growth, is removed from the system as the excess sludge.\n\nOxygen mixing is provided to the aeration basin by mechanical aeration equipment. Various types of aerators are in use, such as surface aerators, submerged turbine aerators, fine-bubble aerators and jet aerators. The last three types require compressed air from blowers or compressors. A large number of process and plant designs exist for the activated sludge process. These alternatives may vary in terms of the design of the aeration basin, the number of stages, the clarifier, and the aeration equipment, as well as the sludge recycling.\n\nb) Aerated lagoon\nAn aerated lagoon has a large volume with residence times for the effluent of 3 - 20 days. The microorganisms grow in suspension in the bulk of liquid, reaching in the lagoon a relatively low solids concentration, 100 - 300 mg/l. The growth of microbes requires oxygen, which is provided almost exclusively by mechanical aeration equipment. Surface turbine aerators are the most common aeration units, but in deep lagoons bottom aerators with self-induced or compressed air feeds are also used. Aeration equipment also provides the mixing required to keep solids in suspension and enhance microbial action. Aerated lagoons require a large area and volume and are constructed as earth basins and can be constructed with or without a settling zone. In the first case, the end of the lagoon is left without aeration and mixing, thus allowing solids to settle. In the latter case, this settling is carried out in a separate pond. The biological process does not involve the recirculation of biomass from the beginning to the end of the basin. The settled sludge is seldom removed, once every 1 - 10 years. \n\nThe use of aerated lagoons has become less common for many reasons: its lower removal efficiency of effluent contaminants in comparison with the activated sludge process, the need for a large land area and basin volume and the high energy requirement for and poor energy efficiency in aeration and mixing. More ambitious effluent requirements contributed to many of the existing lagoons in the industry closing down or being retrofitted to high efficiency activated sludge processes or supplementary effluent treatment basins.\n\nc) Moving bed biofilm reactor\nThe basis of the moving bed biofilm reactor (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)) process is the biofilm carrier elements that are made from polyethylene. The elements provide a large protected surface area for the biofilm and optimal conditions for the bacterial culture to grow. The bacterial cultures digest the soluble organics, gradually mature, and slough off from the media. The cultures form a natural floc which can be easily separated from the water.\n\nd) BAS - Biofilm-activated sludge treatment\nIn order to reduce volumes and decrease energy consumption, compact biological effluent treatment plants were developed during the last ten years which combine moving bed carriers with activated sludge (BAS). \n\nThe advantage of the biofilm carrier is that a large amount of biomass stays on the carrier and does not have to be circulated via a sedimentation chamber. Movable biofilm carriers' advantage compared with fixed beds is that there is no risk of plugging.\n\nThe usage of this technology reduces the retention time by at least 50 % compared with traditional activated sludge plants. The smaller volume makes it possible to build the biological treatment plants closer to the production line thus saving energy and costs. The reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is similar in all different types of treatment plants with activated sludge, but the sludge production is lower than in activated sludge plants when sludge is decomposed in the last stage of the BAS plant (e.g. BAS 0.15 kg suspended solids (Suspended Solids (SS))/kg reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), compared to long-term activated sludge treatment plant (LAS) 0.3 kg Suspended Solids (SS)/kg reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (reference: Sodra mills). Reduction of chlorate is high, 95 -100 %, due to the anoxic conditions in the growing biomass. BAS treatment plants use less energy than other treatment plants due to the compact volume (BAS 23 kWh/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), compared to LAS 33 kWh/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (reference: Sodra mills). However, these compact systems are sensitive to lack of nutrients as the retention time is short. Therefore, these systems are operated with a nutrient surplus, leading to higher emissions of phosphorus and nitrogen.\n\ne) Membrane bioreactor\nA membrane bioreactor (MBR) usually consists of an aerated bioreactor, similar to in the activated sludge process, combined with a membrane process to separate the biomass from the effluent. Two basic MBR configurations exist: one where the membranes are immersed in the reactor and are an integral part of the biological reactor (internal/submerged) and one where the membranes are a separate unit process following the biological reactor (external/sidestream). The cleared filtrate from the membrane stage can be reused in the process while the separated biomass is recirculated to the bioreactor. The high quality of the filtrate makes the MBR technology ideally suited for use as an internal water circuit treatment. To avoid accumulation of solids on the membrane surface, the membrane system requires mechanical or chemical cleaning at defined time intervals. This is normally done fully automatically and carried out directly in the MBR basin (no removal of membranes is necessary).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nReduction of emissions of organic matter (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), BOD), AOX, phosphorus, nitrogen and chelating agents to water.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nActivated sludge plants are widely used in the pulp and paper industry. As a rough estimate, the activated sludge process is used in 60 - 75 % of all the biological effluent treatment plants in this industry and is also the most common waste water treatment used in recently built plants. Generally, the activated sludge process - or comparable techniques such as moving bed biofilm reactors - achieves high treatment efficiencies. However, the biomass is vulnerable to disturbances and operational instability. Therefore, operators usually make provisions that peak loads or flows or some toxic waste water streams be kept away from the biomass of the aerated basin. Measures include controlling the stability of the manufacturing process (see Section 2.9.10), avoiding the influent of spillages of concentrated liquor (see Section 3.3.9) and using emergency tanks (see Section 3.3.12) and equalisation basins.

After biodegradation, biomass and water are separated normally using sedimentation tanks (clarification may be enhanced by flocculation etc.). Different process designs are available, which can be classified in two main categories: activated sludge systems (such as one- or two-stage activated sludge plants or aerated lagoons) and biofilm systems (such as moving bed biofilm reactors (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)) or membrane bioreactors (MBR)). A combination of biofilm and activated sludge systems is also used.\n\na) Activated sludge process \nThe activated sludge plant consists of two main units, the aeration basin and the secondary clarifier (sedimentation basin). In the aeration basin, the effluent is treated with a culture of microorganisms (the activated sludge), which are present in a high concentration. The sludge is separated from the water in the clarifier. Most of the sludge is recycled to the aeration basin, which is necessary for keeping the sludge concentration high. A small part of the sludge, corresponding to the net growth, is removed from the system as the excess sludge.\n\nOxygen mixing is provided to the aeration basin by mechanical aeration equipment. Various types of aerators are in use, such as surface aerators, submerged turbine aerators, fine-bubble aerators and jet aerators. The last three types require compressed air from blowers or compressors. A large number of process and plant designs exist for the activated sludge process. These alternatives may vary in terms of the design of the aeration basin, the number of stages, the clarifier, and the aeration equipment, as well as the sludge recycling.\n\nb) Aerated lagoon\nAn aerated lagoon has a large volume with residence times for the effluent of 3 - 20 days. The microorganisms grow in suspension in the bulk of liquid, reaching in the lagoon a relatively low solids concentration, 100 - 300 mg/l. The growth of microbes requires oxygen, which is provided almost exclusively by mechanical aeration equipment. Surface turbine aerators are the most common aeration units, but in deep lagoons bottom aerators with self-induced or compressed air feeds are also used. Aeration equipment also provides the mixing required to keep solids in suspension and enhance microbial action. Aerated lagoons require a large area and volume and are constructed as earth basins and can be constructed with or without a settling zone. In the first case, the end of the lagoon is left without aeration and mixing, thus allowing solids to settle. In the latter case, this settling is carried out in a separate pond. The biological process does not involve the recirculation of biomass from the beginning to the end of the basin. The settled sludge is seldom removed, once every 1 - 10 years. \n\nThe use of aerated lagoons has become less common for many reasons: its lower removal efficiency of effluent contaminants in comparison with the activated sludge process, the need for a large land area and basin volume and the high energy requirement for and poor energy efficiency in aeration and mixing. More ambitious effluent requirements contributed to many of the existing lagoons in the industry closing down or being retrofitted to high efficiency activated sludge processes or supplementary effluent treatment basins.\n\nc) Moving bed biofilm reactor\nThe basis of the moving bed biofilm reactor (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)) process is the biofilm carrier elements that are made from polyethylene. The elements provide a large protected surface area for the biofilm and optimal conditions for the bacterial culture to grow. The bacterial cultures digest the soluble organics, gradually mature, and slough off from the media. The cultures form a natural floc which can be easily separated from the water.\n\nd) BAS - Biofilm-activated sludge treatment\nIn order to reduce volumes and decrease energy consumption, compact biological effluent treatment plants were developed during the last ten years which combine moving bed carriers with activated sludge (BAS). \n\nThe advantage of the biofilm carrier is that a large amount of biomass stays on the carrier and does not have to be circulated via a sedimentation chamber. Movable biofilm carriers' advantage compared with fixed beds is that there is no risk of plugging.\n\nThe usage of this technology reduces the retention time by at least 50 % compared with traditional activated sludge plants. The smaller volume makes it possible to build the biological treatment plants closer to the production line thus saving energy and costs. The reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is similar in all different types of treatment plants with activated sludge, but the sludge production is lower than in activated sludge plants when sludge is decomposed in the last stage of the BAS plant (e.g. BAS 0.15 kg suspended solids (Suspended Solids (SS))/kg reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), compared to long-term activated sludge treatment plant (LAS) 0.3 kg Suspended Solids (SS)/kg reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (reference: Sodra mills). Reduction of chlorate is high, 95 -100 %, due to the anoxic conditions in the growing biomass. BAS treatment plants use less energy than other treatment plants due to the compact volume (BAS 23 kWh/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), compared to LAS 33 kWh/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (reference: Sodra mills). However, these compact systems are sensitive to lack of nutrients as the retention time is short. Therefore, these systems are operated with a nutrient surplus, leading to higher emissions of phosphorus and nitrogen.\n\ne) Membrane bioreactor\nA membrane bioreactor (MBR) usually consists of an aerated bioreactor, similar to in the activated sludge process, combined with a membrane process to separate the biomass from the effluent. Two basic MBR configurations exist: one where the membranes are immersed in the reactor and are an integral part of the biological reactor (internal/submerged) and one where the membranes are a separate unit process following the biological reactor (external/sidestream). The cleared filtrate from the membrane stage can be reused in the process while the separated biomass is recirculated to the bioreactor. The high quality of the filtrate makes the MBR technology ideally suited for use as an internal water circuit treatment. To avoid accumulation of solids on the membrane surface, the membrane system requires mechanical or chemical cleaning at defined time intervals. This is normally done fully automatically and carried out directly in the MBR basin (no removal of membranes is necessary).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nReduction of emissions of organic matter (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), BOD), AOX, phosphorus, nitrogen and chelating agents to water.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nActivated sludge plants are widely used in the pulp and paper industry. As a rough estimate, the activated sludge process is used in 60 - 75 % of all the biological effluent treatment plants in this industry and is also the most common waste water treatment used in recently built plants. Generally, the activated sludge process - or comparable techniques such as moving bed biofilm reactors - achieves high treatment efficiencies. However, the biomass is vulnerable to disturbances and operational instability. Therefore, operators usually make provisions that peak loads or flows or some toxic waste water streams be kept away from the biomass of the aerated basin. Measures include controlling the stability of the manufacturing process (see Section 2.9.10), avoiding the influent of spillages of concentrated liquor (see Section 3.3.9) and using emergency tanks (see Section 3.3.12) and equalisation basins. The most common reasons for poorer performing plants are the chosen design and dimensioning, too high a load or insufficient maintenance and operation of the system.\n\nThe temperature of the waste water influences the functioning of the biology. The temperature must not exceed 30 - 35 degC in aerobic processes and cooling can become necessary.\n\nFurther information on the specific environmental performance and operational data for application in individual pulp and paper subsectors is given in the sector-specific sections on waste water treatment in Sections 3 to 7.\n\nCross-media effects\nAerobic biological waste water treatment consumes energy (e.g. for aerators and pumps) and generates sludge that normally requires treatment before utilisation or disposal.\n\nSome biological treatment plants in the pulp industry have detected Legionella bacteria.

After biodegradation, biomass and water are separated normally using sedimentation tanks (clarification may be enhanced by flocculation etc.). Different process designs are available, which can be classified in two main categories: activated sludge systems (such as one- or two-stage activated sludge plants or aerated lagoons) and biofilm systems (such as moving bed biofilm reactors (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)) or membrane bioreactors (MBR)). A combination of biofilm and activated sludge systems is also used.\n\na) Activated sludge process \nThe activated sludge plant consists of two main units, the aeration basin and the secondary clarifier (sedimentation basin). In the aeration basin, the effluent is treated with a culture of microorganisms (the activated sludge), which are present in a high concentration. The sludge is separated from the water in the clarifier. Most of the sludge is recycled to the aeration basin, which is necessary for keeping the sludge concentration high. A small part of the sludge, corresponding to the net growth, is removed from the system as the excess sludge.\n\nOxygen mixing is provided to the aeration basin by mechanical aeration equipment. Various types of aerators are in use, such as surface aerators, submerged turbine aerators, fine-bubble aerators and jet aerators. The last three types require compressed air from blowers or compressors. A large number of process and plant designs exist for the activated sludge process. These alternatives may vary in terms of the design of the aeration basin, the number of stages, the clarifier, and the aeration equipment, as well as the sludge recycling.\n\nb) Aerated lagoon\nAn aerated lagoon has a large volume with residence times for the effluent of 3 - 20 days. The microorganisms grow in suspension in the bulk of liquid, reaching in the lagoon a relatively low solids concentration, 100 - 300 mg/l. The growth of microbes requires oxygen, which is provided almost exclusively by mechanical aeration equipment. Surface turbine aerators are the most common aeration units, but in deep lagoons bottom aerators with self-induced or compressed air feeds are also used. Aeration equipment also provides the mixing required to keep solids in suspension and enhance microbial action. Aerated lagoons require a large area and volume and are constructed as earth basins and can be constructed with or without a settling zone. In the first case, the end of the lagoon is left without aeration and mixing, thus allowing solids to settle. In the latter case, this settling is carried out in a separate pond. The biological process does not involve the recirculation of biomass from the beginning to the end of the basin. The settled sludge is seldom removed, once every 1 - 10 years. \n\nThe use of aerated lagoons has become less common for many reasons: its lower removal efficiency of effluent contaminants in comparison with the activated sludge process, the need for a large land area and basin volume and the high energy requirement for and poor energy efficiency in aeration and mixing. More ambitious effluent requirements contributed to many of the existing lagoons in the industry closing down or being retrofitted to high efficiency activated sludge processes or supplementary effluent treatment basins.\n\nc) Moving bed biofilm reactor\nThe basis of the moving bed biofilm reactor (Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR)) process is the biofilm carrier elements that are made from polyethylene. The elements provide a large protected surface area for the biofilm and optimal conditions for the bacterial culture to grow. The bacterial cultures digest the soluble organics, gradually mature, and slough off from the media. The cultures form a natural floc which can be easily separated from the water.\n\nd) BAS - Biofilm-activated sludge treatment\nIn order to reduce volumes and decrease energy consumption, compact biological effluent treatment plants were developed during the last ten years which combine moving bed carriers with activated sludge (BAS). \n\nThe advantage of the biofilm carrier is that a large amount of biomass stays on the carrier and does not have to be circulated via a sedimentation chamber. Movable biofilm carriers' advantage compared with fixed beds is that there is no risk of plugging.\n\nThe usage of this technology reduces the retention time by at least 50 % compared with traditional activated sludge plants. The smaller volume makes it possible to build the biological treatment plants closer to the production line thus saving energy and costs. The reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is similar in all different types of treatment plants with activated sludge, but the sludge production is lower than in activated sludge plants when sludge is decomposed in the last stage of the BAS plant (e.g. BAS 0.15 kg suspended solids (Suspended Solids (SS))/kg reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), compared to long-term activated sludge treatment plant (LAS) 0.3 kg Suspended Solids (SS)/kg reduced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (reference: Sodra mills). Reduction of chlorate is high, 95 -100 %, due to the anoxic conditions in the growing biomass. BAS treatment plants use less energy than other treatment plants due to the compact volume (BAS 23 kWh/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt), compared to LAS 33 kWh/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) (reference: Sodra mills). However, these compact systems are sensitive to lack of nutrients as the retention time is short. Therefore, these systems are operated with a nutrient surplus, leading to higher emissions of phosphorus and nitrogen.\n\ne) Membrane bioreactor\nA membrane bioreactor (MBR) usually consists of an aerated bioreactor, similar to in the activated sludge process, combined with a membrane process to separate the biomass from the effluent. Two basic MBR configurations exist: one where the membranes are immersed in the reactor and are an integral part of the biological reactor (internal/submerged) and one where the membranes are a separate unit process following the biological reactor (external/sidestream). The cleared filtrate from the membrane stage can be reused in the process while the separated biomass is recirculated to the bioreactor. The high quality of the filtrate makes the MBR technology ideally suited for use as an internal water circuit treatment. To avoid accumulation of solids on the membrane surface, the membrane system requires mechanical or chemical cleaning at defined time intervals. This is normally done fully automatically and carried out directly in the MBR basin (no removal of membranes is necessary).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nReduction of emissions of organic matter (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), BOD), AOX, phosphorus, nitrogen and chelating agents to water.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nActivated sludge plants are widely used in the pulp and paper industry. As a rough estimate, the activated sludge process is used in 60 - 75 % of all the biological effluent treatment plants in this industry and is also the most common waste water treatment used in recently built plants. Generally, the activated sludge process - or comparable techniques such as moving bed biofilm reactors - achieves high treatment efficiencies. However, the biomass is vulnerable to disturbances and operational instability. Therefore, operators usually make provisions that peak loads or flows or some toxic waste water streams be kept away from the biomass of the aerated basin. Measures include controlling the stability of the manufacturing process (see Section 2.9.10), avoiding the influent of spillages of concentrated liquor (see Section 3.3.9) and using emergency tanks (see Section 3.3.12) and equalisation basins. The most common reasons for poorer performing plants are the chosen design and dimensioning, too high a load or insufficient maintenance and operation of the system.\n\nThe temperature of the waste water influences the functioning of the biology. The temperature must not exceed 30 - 35 degC in aerobic processes and cooling can become necessary.\n\nFurther information on the specific environmental performance and operational data for application in individual pulp and paper subsectors is given in the sector-specific sections on waste water treatment in Sections 3 to 7.\n\nCross-media effects\nAerobic biological waste water treatment consumes energy (e.g. for aerators and pumps) and generates sludge that normally requires treatment before utilisation or disposal.\n\nSome biological treatment plants in the pulp industry have detected Legionella bacteria. The issue should be taken care of by operators in cooperation with the competent authorities in order to minimise and control the dispersion of these bacteria.\n\nFor compact biological treatment plants, the use of a nutrient surplus may lead to higher emissions of phosphorus and nitrogen.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nApplicable to new and existing plants. For specific information on applicability, economics, etc. see the sector-specific information provided on secondary treatment in Sections 3 to 7.\n\nInformation on economics, driving force for implementation, example plants and reference literature for this technique is given in the sector-specific sections on aerobic treatment (see sections 3.3.13, 4.3.16, 5.3.12, 6.3.8 and 7.3.11).\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2926888_abstract", "x": 0.6144073, "y": 0.33219206, "title": "SYSTEM FOR WASHING MEMBRANE, AND METHOD FOR WASHING MEMBRANE USING SAME", "year": 2015, "text": "A system for cleaning a membrane of the present invention comprises: a first membrane filtration tank which comprises a membrane and an aerator, filters inflow raw water by membrane filtration, and discharges treated water and water to be treated, respectively; a pressure gauge for measuring a transmembrane and a flow meter for measuring a permeation flux which are provided at a treated water discharge line of the first membrane filtration tank; and a control means which calculates a water permeability recovery rate by calculating the water permeability from the differential pressure measured at the pressure gauge and the permeation flux measured at the flow meter, predicts a membrane contamination degree from the calculated water permeability recovery rate, and controls a back-pulsing interval and an intermittent aerationinterval.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"7.3.3\" title=\"Internal treatment of white water by use of membrane filtration and recycling of treated process water\">\n<references_to>2.9.11.2, 6.3.4, 7.3.5</references_to>\n<referenced_by>2.9.3, 6.3.2, 6.3.3, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.4, 7.3.11</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nInternal treatment of white water by use of membrane filtration and recycling of treated process water\n\nAlthough the technique described in this section is the same as the one in Section 7.3.5, the application is very different.\n\nDescription\nConventional filtration cannot properly remove solids and colloidal material below 1 mm effective size. Thus small bacteria and colloids escape the filter media. However, this is only true for unflocculated solids and colloids. They can also be transformed into 100 - 1 000 mm flocs by flocculation and can be easily filtered off. But the addition of flocculants may have the drawback of undesirable salts being introduced into the water system (modern organic/synthetic flocculants do not introduce a significant salt burden).\n\nMembrane technologies, depending on the applicable membrane cut-off size (corresponding to the approximate 'molecular weight' of the organic compounds removed) and filtering pressure, can theoretically remove almost 100 % of the organic material (see Figure   7 .297) without introducing undesirable compounds into the water circuits.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.297:\tFiltration ranges of different filtration technologies\n\n\n\nAccording to the differences in pore size, different membrane processes can be distinguished:\n\nMicro-filtration (Micro-filtration (MF)), which operates at below 1 bar pressure and uses membranes with 0.1 - 0.2 mm pore size, could be used where 1 - 5 mg/l of very fine solids is acceptable after treatment.\nUltrafiltration (UF) operates at 1 - 2 bar pressure difference and is regarded a possible solution for 100 % removal of residual solids and colloids and high molecular weight organics from pulp and paper mills' water or effluent streams. In Europe, a few full-scale applications for white water treatment with UF technology exist. \nNano-filtration (Nano-filtration (NF)) or reverse osmosis (Reverse Osmosis (RO)) use pressures reaching 15 - 25 bars, but so far these methods have not been seriously considered for full-scale use in the pulp and paper industry in Europe (there is one full-scale application in the High Desert of north-western New Mexico).\n\nAny type of membrane filtration cannot handle sudden peaks of suspended solids. If the suspended solids are homogeneous, only a police filter is needed to avoid sudden peaks. \n\nKey issues affecting the selection of a membrane technology are as follows:\n\nInput stream, its composition and hydraulic load, including peak operating conditions.\nClean water quantity and quality required and the applicability of treatment output in varying operating conditions for intended end uses and the effect on pulp or paper quality.\nHigh-pressure filtration methods produce cleaner water, but consume more electricity and must be sized larger or equipped with more efficient pretreatment or counter-measures to protect against plugging.\nMaintenance requirements (symmetric or asymmetric membrane structure, washing with acids or alkaline solutions, spare capacity, automated or continuous cleaning). Symmetric membranes have a higher tendency to plug. Plugging can be avoided by maintaining highly turbulent conditions close to the membrane wall, but this requires somewhat more energy.\nFinal treatment and disposal of the concentrate or sludge, which in most cases is waste. Liquid waste may be concentrated enough to cause toxic effects at an effluent treatment or it may require further concentration or absorption into a solid fuel for disposal by incineration. Some inorganic salts in the concentrate are corrosive, which must be taken into account in the selection of equipment and piping materials.\n\nWhen considering these aspects, UF can be used as a kidney to handle disturbing matter in the white water and close the water system further. \n\nFor in-line white water treatment, the kidneys consist of a common disc filter, a pre-filter (pressure screen or bow screen) for the removal of long fibres that could harm the membranes and the UF system. The rejects from the pre-filters are recycled back to the process. Optionally, the cloudy filtrate can also be sent to the UF feed together with clear filtrate. This is for cases where the clear filtrate is so clean (Suspended Solids (SS) <20 mg/l) that some additional solids are beneficial to filtration by keeping the cross-flow membrane surface cleaner. Normally, the pre-filtered clear filtrate is piped to the UF system's feed tank and pumped into the UF unit. The number of filters in operation regulate the clean UF permeate capacity. The pressure difference is kept as low as possible at, for instance, 0.7 - 0.8 bars. The quality of the UF filtrate is sufficient for use as, for example, high-pressure (High-pressure (HP)) shower water, sealing water and for the dilution of chemical additives. The concentrate from the filters can be piped to the main effluent treatment. A possible layout for an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification is shown in Figure   7 .298.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.298:\tPossible layout of an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nUF technology is today commonly applied when fresh water consumption is to be decreased or when the hydraulic discharge load (not the organic load) needs to be reduced. By replacing warm fresh water with ultrafiltrated white water from the paper machine, a fresh water reduction of about 2 - 4 m3/t of paper is normally achieved.\n\nUltrafiltration in white water applications usually means the treatment of clear filtrate and/or parts of the cloudy filtrate from the disc filter. The UF membranes in practice remove 100 % of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 99 % of bacteria, 100 % of turbidity (all colloidal material is removed), and 45 - 70 % of anionicity. Dissolved Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is lowered by about 10 - 20 %. This means that UF still allows parts of the organic substances (e.g. all low molecular weight organics) and soluble inorganic matter to pass through. First of all, UF of white water gives better quality recirculated water which can be used for low- and high-pressure shower water in the wire section, dilution water for chemicals, press section lubrication water or other washing and cleaning purposes. There is not yet experience of using the permeate for felt cleaning.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nMembrane treatment processes used specifically for paper or board machines' white water have been tested basically at full scale for all common paper grades. The full-scale applications so far are:\n\nSappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine paper), Finland; white water treatment, feed from save-all, the permeate is used at wire section showers (high- and low-pressure) and as sealing water;\nUPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (back paper for labels), Finland; applications: wire section high-pressure and low-pressure showers;\nHolmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; applications: wire section high-pressure showers;\nModern Karton mill (Testliner/fluting) based on old corrugated container (Old Corrugated Container (OCC)), Turkey; applications: wire section high-pressure showers;\nHokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; applications: wire section high-pressure showers.\n\nThe practical limitations of membrane filters are usually set by the membrane material itself, which is sensitive to plugging unless the units are equipped with pretreatment for solids removal or in-built systems that provide cleaning or maintain strong turbulence close to the membrane surface. Regular washing of filters with acids or alkaline solutions (NaOH, detergents, and tensides) is required, generating small amounts of liquid waste. When the flux of permeate goes down, the membranes must also be changed from time to time (the lifetime of a membrane is about 15 months).\n\nCross-media effects\nThe electricity usage for UF technology depends on the paper grade and thus the process water quality to be treated (temperature, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), etc.). White water from RCF-based Testliner/fluting processes is usually colder and more concentrated than white water from mechanical and wood-free printing paper manufacturing and therefore achieves a 30 - 50 % higher flux. So, one UF unit gives significantly different treated volumes (m3/d). For printing paper, ultrafiltration requires electricity in the range of 2.6 kWh/m3 of treated white water and approximately 4.7 kWh/m3 for RCF-based Testliner/fluting mills.\n\nA possible reduction of water consumption can indirectly lead to a decrease of the discharged nutrients load (N and P) because the total N and P releases are governed by the minimum concentration that is required for the growth of biomass in waste water treatment plants.\n\nFor membrane filtration, the solution as to how to treat the liquid or solid wastes is crucial. In full-scale UF applications, the concentrate from membrane filtration (3 - 5 % of the feed) is further treated in the biological treatment plant. In this case, no reduction of the total solid load to the receiving water body is achieved. However, investigations into whether to treat the concentrate separately are still being carried out.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUF could be applied on super clear filtrate or on biotreated water from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). The treatment of excess white water with UF membrane filtration for reuse at wire section showers has become a proven and accepted technique at paper and board mills when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. Ultrafiltrated water has also been used for press section showers, but this application is still only used in special cases due to the UF only partially removing the dissolved materials.\n\nThis technique is also applicable in RCF-based mills and has already been proved with full-scale applications (e.g. Modern Karton Sanayi Ticaret AS in Corlu, Turkey; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany).\n\nFor process water with higher concentrations of organic substances, like that from the production of 'brown paper' from recycled fibre, biological treatment followed by sand filtration is another feasible option when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. It allows for the partial recycling of water from the long circulation. This technique is described in Section 6.3.4. \n\nThere are also combined systems under development, 'membrane bio-reactors' (MBR) as described in Section 2.9.11.2.1. In special applications, such as coating chemical recovery from paper machine coating effluents, UF membrane technology is already a tested technology and several applications exist (see Section 7.3.5).\n\nIn general terms, paper machine water loop closure with self-contained removal of dissolved organic or inorganic constituents is a technique that is still undergoing some development. It is not as well established as biological treatment for example.\nEconomics\nThe operating costs of ultrafiltration depend on the energy price and on the achieved flux (filtrated volume per membrane surface and hour). Assuming electricity costs of EUR 0.05/kWh, the following operational costs can be calculated:\n\nRCF Testliner/fluting based on old corrugated container (175 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.42 per m3;\nprinting paper (300 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.25 per m3. \n\nAn example calculation for the operational costs of UF of white water of a printing paper mill that manufactures 350 000 tonnes/yr is given in Table   7 .186 (data from a supplier, 2010). The membrane treatment capacity is 3.0 m3/t, which corresponds to 126 m3/h or 300 l/m2h.\n\n\nTable 7.186:\tExample calculation for operational costs of ultrafiltration of white water from printing paper production\n\n\nAlthough membrane filtration consumes energy, in some cases savings can be achieved with regard to the dryer section energy consumption. When fresh water consumption decreases, the process temperature increases. It is easier to remove water and to achieve better web dryness after the press section and thus less heating energy is needed at the dryer section.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMembrane filtration may be applied in mills which face strict requirements for discharge either because they are situated near a sensitive recipient or because there are plans for a significant increase in capacity. Some authorities in Europe require that the effluent load does not increase with capacity. UF technology may also be applied in cases where availability of water is scarce. \n\nUF of white water may also reduce the downtime of the paper machine caused by the required washing off of substances concentrated in the recycled clear filtrate.\n\nExample plants\nMembrane filtration of process waters is applied in about six European pulp and paper mills, however there is no reference from a 'totally closed' mill. These membrane applications are mostly on white water clear filtrates with the objective of reducing fresh water demand. Example plants are the Sappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine and fine paper production), Finland; UPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (released paper), Finland; Holmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; Modern Karton Liner/Fluting mill, Turkey; Hokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany.\n\nIn the US, there are closed-cycle paper mills with membrane technology in combination with biological treatment (McKinley linerboard paper company, New Mexico, US).\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3225595_abstract", "x": 0.5948448, "y": 0.30524343, "title": "WATER PRODUCTION METHOD", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention relates to a fresh water generation method including: feeding raw water or pretreated water thereof as feed water into a semipermeable membrane module in a pressurized state using a booster pump, thereby separating the feed water into a concentrate and a permeate having a low concentration, in which a scale inhibitor having a reducing function is dosed intermittently or continuously upstream from the semipermeable membrane module, thereby inhibiting scale generation and maintaining an oxidation-reduction potential of at least either the feed water or the concentrate to a threshold value or lower.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"7.3.3\" title=\"Internal treatment of white water by use of membrane filtration and recycling of treated process water\">\n<references_to>2.9.11.2, 6.3.4, 7.3.5</references_to>\n<referenced_by>2.9.3, 6.3.2, 6.3.3, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.4, 7.3.11</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nInternal treatment of white water by use of membrane filtration and recycling of treated process water\n\nAlthough the technique described in this section is the same as the one in Section 7.3.5, the application is very different.\n\nDescription\nConventional filtration cannot properly remove solids and colloidal material below 1 mm effective size.

So, one UF unit gives significantly different treated volumes (m3/d).

In full-scale UF applications, the concentrate from membrane filtration (3 - 5 % of the feed) is further treated in the biological treatment plant. In this case, no reduction of the total solid load to the receiving water body is achieved. However, investigations into whether to treat the concentrate separately are still being carried out.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUF could be applied on super clear filtrate or on biotreated water from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP).

In special applications, such as coating chemical recovery from paper machine coating effluents, UF membrane technology is already a tested technology and several applications exist (see Section 7.3.5).\n\nIn general terms, paper machine water loop closure with self-contained removal of dissolved organic or inorganic constituents is a technique that is still undergoing some development. It is not as well established as biological treatment for example.\nEconomics\nThe operating costs of ultrafiltration depend on the energy price and on the achieved flux (filtrated volume per membrane surface and hour). Assuming electricity costs of EUR 0.05/kWh, the following operational costs can be calculated:\n\nRCF Testliner/fluting based on old corrugated container (175 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.42 per m3;\nprinting paper (300 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.25 per m3. \n\nAn example calculation for the operational costs of UF of white water of a printing paper mill that manufactures 350 000 tonnes/yr is given in Table   7 .186 (data from a supplier, 2010). The membrane treatment capacity is 3.0 m3/t, which corresponds to 126 m3/h or 300 l/m2h.\n\n\nTable 7.186:\tExample calculation for operational costs of ultrafiltration of white water from printing paper production\n\n\nAlthough membrane filtration consumes energy, in some cases savings can be achieved with regard to the dryer section energy consumption. When fresh water consumption decreases, the process temperature increases. It is easier to remove water and to achieve better web dryness after the press section and thus less heating energy is needed at the dryer section.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMembrane filtration may be applied in mills which face strict requirements for discharge either because they are situated near a sensitive recipient or because there are plans for a significant increase in capacity. Some authorities in Europe require that the effluent load does not increase with capacity. UF technology may also be applied in cases where availability of water is scarce. \n\nUF of white water may also reduce the downtime of the paper machine caused by the required washing off of substances concentrated in the recycled clear filtrate.\n\nExample plants\nMembrane filtration of process waters is applied in about six European pulp and paper mills, however there is no reference from a 'totally closed' mill. These membrane applications are mostly on white water clear filtrates with the objective of reducing fresh water demand. Example plants are the Sappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine and fine paper production), Finland; UPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (released paper), Finland; Holmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; Modern Karton Liner/Fluting mill, Turkey; Hokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany.\n\nIn the US, there are closed-cycle paper mills with membrane technology in combination with biological treatment (McKinley linerboard paper company, New Mexico, US).\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3263531_abstract", "x": 0.59733444, "y": 0.3083566, "title": "METHOD FOR OPERATING A MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR OF A WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM AND CORRESPONDING MEMBRANE BIOREACTOR AND WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM", "year": 2018, "text": "Method for operating a membrane bioreactor of a water treatment system for water production and corresponding bioreactor and water treatment system.

Thus small bacteria and colloids escape the filter media. However, this is only true for unflocculated solids and colloids. They can also be transformed into 100 - 1 000 mm flocs by flocculation and can be easily filtered off. But the addition of flocculants may have the drawback of undesirable salts being introduced into the water system (modern organic/synthetic flocculants do not introduce a significant salt burden).\n\nMembrane technologies, depending on the applicable membrane cut-off size (corresponding to the approximate 'molecular weight' of the organic compounds removed) and filtering pressure, can theoretically remove almost 100 % of the organic material (see Figure   7 .297) without introducing undesirable compounds into the water circuits.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.297:\tFiltration ranges of different filtration technologies\n\n\n\nAccording to the differences in pore size, different membrane processes can be distinguished:\n\nMicro-filtration (Micro-filtration (MF)), which operates at below 1 bar pressure and uses membranes with 0.1 - 0.2 mm pore size, could be used where 1 - 5 mg/l of very fine solids is acceptable after treatment.\nUltrafiltration (UF) operates at 1 - 2 bar pressure difference and is regarded a possible solution for 100 % removal of residual solids and colloids and high molecular weight organics from pulp and paper mills' water or effluent streams. In Europe, a few full-scale applications for white water treatment with UF technology exist. \nNano-filtration (Nano-filtration (NF)) or reverse osmosis (Reverse Osmosis (RO)) use pressures reaching 15 - 25 bars, but so far these methods have not been seriously considered for full-scale use in the pulp and paper industry in Europe (there is one full-scale application in the High Desert of north-western New Mexico).\n\nAny type of membrane filtration cannot handle sudden peaks of suspended solids. If the suspended solids are homogeneous, only a police filter is needed to avoid sudden peaks. \n\nKey issues affecting the selection of a membrane technology are as follows:\n\nInput stream, its composition and hydraulic load, including peak operating conditions.\nClean water quantity and quality required and the applicability of treatment output in varying operating conditions for intended end uses and the effect on pulp or paper quality.\nHigh-pressure filtration methods produce cleaner water, but consume more electricity and must be sized larger or equipped with more efficient pretreatment or counter-measures to protect against plugging.\nMaintenance requirements (symmetric or asymmetric membrane structure, washing with acids or alkaline solutions, spare capacity, automated or continuous cleaning). Symmetric membranes have a higher tendency to plug. Plugging can be avoided by maintaining highly turbulent conditions close to the membrane wall, but this requires somewhat more energy.\nFinal treatment and disposal of the concentrate or sludge, which in most cases is waste. Liquid waste may be concentrated enough to cause toxic effects at an effluent treatment or it may require further concentration or absorption into a solid fuel for disposal by incineration. Some inorganic salts in the concentrate are corrosive, which must be taken into account in the selection of equipment and piping materials.\n\nWhen considering these aspects, UF can be used as a kidney to handle disturbing matter in the white water and close the water system further. \n\nFor in-line white water treatment, the kidneys consist of a common disc filter, a pre-filter (pressure screen or bow screen) for the removal of long fibres that could harm the membranes and the UF system. The rejects from the pre-filters are recycled back to the process. Optionally, the cloudy filtrate can also be sent to the UF feed together with clear filtrate. This is for cases where the clear filtrate is so clean (Suspended Solids (SS) <20 mg/l) that some additional solids are beneficial to filtration by keeping the cross-flow membrane surface cleaner. Normally, the pre-filtered clear filtrate is piped to the UF system's feed tank and pumped into the UF unit. The number of filters in operation regulate the clean UF permeate capacity. The pressure difference is kept as low as possible at, for instance, 0.7 - 0.8 bars. The quality of the UF filtrate is sufficient for use as, for example, high-pressure (High-pressure (HP)) shower water, sealing water and for the dilution of chemical additives. The concentrate from the filters can be piped to the main effluent treatment. A possible layout for an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification is shown in Figure   7 .298.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.298:\tPossible layout of an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nUF technology is today commonly applied when fresh water consumption is to be decreased or when the hydraulic discharge load (not the organic load) needs to be reduced. By replacing warm fresh water with ultrafiltrated white water from the paper machine, a fresh water reduction of about 2 - 4 m3/t of paper is normally achieved.\n\nUltrafiltration in white water applications usually means the treatment of clear filtrate and/or parts of the cloudy filtrate from the disc filter. The UF membranes in practice remove 100 % of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 99 % of bacteria, 100 % of turbidity (all colloidal material is removed), and 45 - 70 % of anionicity. Dissolved Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is lowered by about 10 - 20 %. This means that UF still allows parts of the organic substances (e.g. all low molecular weight organics) and soluble inorganic matter to pass through. First of all, UF of white water gives better quality recirculated water which can be used for low- and high-pressure shower water in the wire section, dilution water for chemicals, press section lubrication water or other washing and cleaning purposes. There is not yet experience of using the permeate for felt cleaning.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nMembrane treatment processes used specifically for paper or board machines' white water have been tested basically at full scale for all common paper grades. The full-scale applications so far are:\n\nSappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine paper), Finland; white water treatment, feed from save-all, the permeate is used at wire section showers (high- and low-pressure) and as sealing water;\nUPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (back paper for labels), Finland; applications: wire section high-pressure and low-pressure showers;\nHolmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; applications: wire section high-pressure showers;\nModern Karton mill (Testliner/fluting) based on old corrugated container (Old Corrugated Container (OCC)), Turkey; applications: wire section high-pressure showers;\nHokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; applications: wire section high-pressure showers.\n\nThe practical limitations of membrane filters are usually set by the membrane material itself, which is sensitive to plugging unless the units are equipped with pretreatment for solids removal or in-built systems that provide cleaning or maintain strong turbulence close to the membrane surface. Regular washing of filters with acids or alkaline solutions (NaOH, detergents, and tensides) is required, generating small amounts of liquid waste. When the flux of permeate goes down, the membranes must also be changed from time to time (the lifetime of a membrane is about 15 months).\n\nCross-media effects\nThe electricity usage for UF technology depends on the paper grade and thus the process water quality to be treated (temperature, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), etc.). White water from RCF-based Testliner/fluting processes is usually colder and more concentrated than white water from mechanical and wood-free printing paper manufacturing and therefore achieves a 30 - 50 % higher flux. So, one UF unit gives significantly different treated volumes (m3/d). For printing paper, ultrafiltration requires electricity in the range of 2.6 kWh/m3 of treated white water and approximately 4.7 kWh/m3 for RCF-based Testliner/fluting mills.\n\nA possible reduction of water consumption can indirectly lead to a decrease of the discharged nutrients load (N and P) because the total N and P releases are governed by the minimum concentration that is required for the growth of biomass in waste water treatment plants.\n\nFor membrane filtration, the solution as to how to treat the liquid or solid wastes is crucial. In full-scale UF applications, the concentrate from membrane filtration (3 - 5 % of the feed) is further treated in the biological treatment plant. In this case, no reduction of the total solid load to the receiving water body is achieved. However, investigations into whether to treat the concentrate separately are still being carried out.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUF could be applied on super clear filtrate or on biotreated water from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). The treatment of excess white water with UF membrane filtration for reuse at wire section showers has become a proven and accepted technique at paper and board mills when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. Ultrafiltrated water has also been used for press section showers, but this application is still only used in special cases due to the UF only partially removing the dissolved materials.\n\nThis technique is also applicable in RCF-based mills and has already been proved with full-scale applications (e.g. Modern Karton Sanayi Ticaret AS in Corlu, Turkey; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany).\n\nFor process water with higher concentrations of organic substances, like that from the production of 'brown paper' from recycled fibre, biological treatment followed by sand filtration is another feasible option when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. It allows for the partial recycling of water from the long circulation. This technique is described in Section 6.3.4. \n\nThere are also combined systems under development, 'membrane bio-reactors' (MBR) as described in Section 2.9.11.2.1. In special applications, such as coating chemical recovery from paper machine coating effluents, UF membrane technology is already a tested technology and several applications exist (see Section 7.3.5).\n\nIn general terms, paper machine water loop closure with self-contained removal of dissolved organic or inorganic constituents is a technique that is still undergoing some development. It is not as well established as biological treatment for example.\nEconomics\nThe operating costs of ultrafiltration depend on the energy price and on the achieved flux (filtrated volume per membrane surface and hour). Assuming electricity costs of EUR 0.05/kWh, the following operational costs can be calculated:\n\nRCF Testliner/fluting based on old corrugated container (175 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.42 per m3;\nprinting paper (300 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.25 per m3. \n\nAn example calculation for the operational costs of UF of white water of a printing paper mill that manufactures 350 000 tonnes/yr is given in Table   7 .186 (data from a supplier, 2010). The membrane treatment capacity is 3.0 m3/t, which corresponds to 126 m3/h or 300 l/m2h.\n\n\nTable 7.186:\tExample calculation for operational costs of ultrafiltration of white water from printing paper production\n\n\nAlthough membrane filtration consumes energy, in some cases savings can be achieved with regard to the dryer section energy consumption.

But the addition of flocculants may have the drawback of undesirable salts being introduced into the water system (modern organic/synthetic flocculants do not introduce a significant salt burden).\n\nMembrane technologies, depending on the applicable membrane cut-off size (corresponding to the approximate 'molecular weight' of the organic compounds removed) and filtering pressure, can theoretically remove almost 100 % of the organic material (see Figure   7 .297) without introducing undesirable compounds into the water circuits.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.297:\tFiltration ranges of different filtration technologies\n\n\n\nAccording to the differences in pore size, different membrane processes can be distinguished:\n\nMicro-filtration (Micro-filtration (MF)), which operates at below 1 bar pressure and uses membranes with 0.1 - 0.2 mm pore size, could be used where 1 - 5 mg/l of very fine solids is acceptable after treatment.\nUltrafiltration (UF) operates at 1 - 2 bar pressure difference and is regarded a possible solution for 100 % removal of residual solids and colloids and high molecular weight organics from pulp and paper mills' water or effluent streams. In Europe, a few full-scale applications for white water treatment with UF technology exist. \nNano-filtration (Nano-filtration (NF)) or reverse osmosis (Reverse Osmosis (RO)) use pressures reaching 15 - 25 bars, but so far these methods have not been seriously considered for full-scale use in the pulp and paper industry in Europe (there is one full-scale application in the High Desert of north-western New Mexico).\n\nAny type of membrane filtration cannot handle sudden peaks of suspended solids. If the suspended solids are homogeneous, only a police filter is needed to avoid sudden peaks. \n\nKey issues affecting the selection of a membrane technology are as follows:\n\nInput stream, its composition and hydraulic load, including peak operating conditions.\nClean water quantity and quality required and the applicability of treatment output in varying operating conditions for intended end uses and the effect on pulp or paper quality.\nHigh-pressure filtration methods produce cleaner water, but consume more electricity and must be sized larger or equipped with more efficient pretreatment or counter-measures to protect against plugging.\nMaintenance requirements (symmetric or asymmetric membrane structure, washing with acids or alkaline solutions, spare capacity, automated or continuous cleaning). Symmetric membranes have a higher tendency to plug. Plugging can be avoided by maintaining highly turbulent conditions close to the membrane wall, but this requires somewhat more energy.\nFinal treatment and disposal of the concentrate or sludge, which in most cases is waste. Liquid waste may be concentrated enough to cause toxic effects at an effluent treatment or it may require further concentration or absorption into a solid fuel for disposal by incineration. Some inorganic salts in the concentrate are corrosive, which must be taken into account in the selection of equipment and piping materials.\n\nWhen considering these aspects, UF can be used as a kidney to handle disturbing matter in the white water and close the water system further. \n\nFor in-line white water treatment, the kidneys consist of a common disc filter, a pre-filter (pressure screen or bow screen) for the removal of long fibres that could harm the membranes and the UF system. The rejects from the pre-filters are recycled back to the process. Optionally, the cloudy filtrate can also be sent to the UF feed together with clear filtrate. This is for cases where the clear filtrate is so clean (Suspended Solids (SS) <20 mg/l) that some additional solids are beneficial to filtration by keeping the cross-flow membrane surface cleaner. Normally, the pre-filtered clear filtrate is piped to the UF system's feed tank and pumped into the UF unit. The number of filters in operation regulate the clean UF permeate capacity. The pressure difference is kept as low as possible at, for instance, 0.7 - 0.8 bars. The quality of the UF filtrate is sufficient for use as, for example, high-pressure (High-pressure (HP)) shower water, sealing water and for the dilution of chemical additives. The concentrate from the filters can be piped to the main effluent treatment. A possible layout for an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification is shown in Figure   7 .298.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.298:\tPossible layout of an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nUF technology is today commonly applied when fresh water consumption is to be decreased or when the hydraulic discharge load (not the organic load) needs to be reduced. By replacing warm fresh water with ultrafiltrated white water from the paper machine, a fresh water reduction of about 2 - 4 m3/t of paper is normally achieved.\n\nUltrafiltration in white water applications usually means the treatment of clear filtrate and/or parts of the cloudy filtrate from the disc filter. The UF membranes in practice remove 100 % of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 99 % of bacteria, 100 % of turbidity (all colloidal material is removed), and 45 - 70 % of anionicity. Dissolved Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is lowered by about 10 - 20 %. This means that UF still allows parts of the organic substances (e.g. all low molecular weight organics) and soluble inorganic matter to pass through. First of all, UF of white water gives better quality recirculated water which can be used for low- and high-pressure shower water in the wire section, dilution water for chemicals, press section lubrication water or other washing and cleaning purposes. There is not yet experience of using the permeate for felt cleaning.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nMembrane treatment processes used specifically for paper or board machines' white water have been tested basically at full scale for all common paper grades. The full-scale applications so far are:\n\nSappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine paper), Finland; white water treatment, feed from save-all, the permeate is used at wire section showers (high- and low-pressure) and as sealing water;\nUPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (back paper for labels), Finland; applications: wire section high-pressure and low-pressure showers;\nHolmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; applications: wire section high-pressure showers;\nModern Karton mill (Testliner/fluting) based on old corrugated container (Old Corrugated Container (OCC)), Turkey; applications: wire section high-pressure showers;\nHokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; applications: wire section high-pressure showers.\n\nThe practical limitations of membrane filters are usually set by the membrane material itself, which is sensitive to plugging unless the units are equipped with pretreatment for solids removal or in-built systems that provide cleaning or maintain strong turbulence close to the membrane surface. Regular washing of filters with acids or alkaline solutions (NaOH, detergents, and tensides) is required, generating small amounts of liquid waste. When the flux of permeate goes down, the membranes must also be changed from time to time (the lifetime of a membrane is about 15 months).\n\nCross-media effects\nThe electricity usage for UF technology depends on the paper grade and thus the process water quality to be treated (temperature, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), etc.). White water from RCF-based Testliner/fluting processes is usually colder and more concentrated than white water from mechanical and wood-free printing paper manufacturing and therefore achieves a 30 - 50 % higher flux. So, one UF unit gives significantly different treated volumes (m3/d). For printing paper, ultrafiltration requires electricity in the range of 2.6 kWh/m3 of treated white water and approximately 4.7 kWh/m3 for RCF-based Testliner/fluting mills.\n\nA possible reduction of water consumption can indirectly lead to a decrease of the discharged nutrients load (N and P) because the total N and P releases are governed by the minimum concentration that is required for the growth of biomass in waste water treatment plants.\n\nFor membrane filtration, the solution as to how to treat the liquid or solid wastes is crucial. In full-scale UF applications, the concentrate from membrane filtration (3 - 5 % of the feed) is further treated in the biological treatment plant. In this case, no reduction of the total solid load to the receiving water body is achieved. However, investigations into whether to treat the concentrate separately are still being carried out.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUF could be applied on super clear filtrate or on biotreated water from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). The treatment of excess white water with UF membrane filtration for reuse at wire section showers has become a proven and accepted technique at paper and board mills when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. Ultrafiltrated water has also been used for press section showers, but this application is still only used in special cases due to the UF only partially removing the dissolved materials.\n\nThis technique is also applicable in RCF-based mills and has already been proved with full-scale applications (e.g. Modern Karton Sanayi Ticaret AS in Corlu, Turkey; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany).\n\nFor process water with higher concentrations of organic substances, like that from the production of 'brown paper' from recycled fibre, biological treatment followed by sand filtration is another feasible option when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. It allows for the partial recycling of water from the long circulation. This technique is described in Section 6.3.4. \n\nThere are also combined systems under development, 'membrane bio-reactors' (MBR) as described in Section 2.9.11.2.1. In special applications, such as coating chemical recovery from paper machine coating effluents, UF membrane technology is already a tested technology and several applications exist (see Section 7.3.5).\n\nIn general terms, paper machine water loop closure with self-contained removal of dissolved organic or inorganic constituents is a technique that is still undergoing some development. It is not as well established as biological treatment for example.\nEconomics\nThe operating costs of ultrafiltration depend on the energy price and on the achieved flux (filtrated volume per membrane surface and hour). Assuming electricity costs of EUR 0.05/kWh, the following operational costs can be calculated:\n\nRCF Testliner/fluting based on old corrugated container (175 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.42 per m3;\nprinting paper (300 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.25 per m3. \n\nAn example calculation for the operational costs of UF of white water of a printing paper mill that manufactures 350 000 tonnes/yr is given in Table   7 .186 (data from a supplier, 2010). The membrane treatment capacity is 3.0 m3/t, which corresponds to 126 m3/h or 300 l/m2h.\n\n\nTable 7.186:\tExample calculation for operational costs of ultrafiltration of white water from printing paper production\n\n\nAlthough membrane filtration consumes energy, in some cases savings can be achieved with regard to the dryer section energy consumption. When fresh water consumption decreases, the process temperature increases. It is easier to remove water and to achieve better web dryness after the press section and thus less heating energy is needed at the dryer section.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMembrane filtration may be applied in mills which face strict requirements for discharge either because they are situated near a sensitive recipient or because there are plans for a significant increase in capacity. Some authorities in Europe require that the effluent load does not increase with capacity. UF technology may also be applied in cases where availability of water is scarce. \n\nUF of white water may also reduce the downtime of the paper machine caused by the required washing off of substances concentrated in the recycled clear filtrate.\n\nExample plants\nMembrane filtration of process waters is applied in about six European pulp and paper mills, however there is no reference from a 'totally closed' mill. These membrane applications are mostly on white water clear filtrates with the objective of reducing fresh water demand. Example plants are the Sappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine and fine paper production), Finland; UPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (released paper), Finland; Holmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; Modern Karton Liner/Fluting mill, Turkey; Hokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany.\n\nIn the US, there are closed-cycle paper mills with membrane technology in combination with biological treatment (McKinley linerboard paper company, New Mexico, US).\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3260427_abstract", "x": 0.61602926, "y": 0.30806923, "title": "SYSTEM FOR MAINTAINING WATER QUALITY IN LARGE WATER BODIES", "year": 2017, "text": "The present application relates to an optimized method system for maintaining water quality in water bodies such as excavated inland structures and floating structures with bottoms comprising flexible membranes, using a simplified economic filtration system and degreasing system that requires much smaller filtration equipment than conventional centralized filtration systems and provides for consumption of significantly lower amounts of energy.

Regular washing of filters with acids or alkaline solutions (NaOH, detergents, and tensides) is required, generating small amounts of liquid waste. When the flux of permeate goes down, the membranes must also be changed from time to time (the lifetime of a membrane is about 15 months).\n\nCross-media effects\nThe electricity usage for UF technology depends on the paper grade and thus the process water quality to be treated (temperature, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), etc.). White water from RCF-based Testliner/fluting processes is usually colder and more concentrated than white water from mechanical and wood-free printing paper manufacturing and therefore achieves a 30 - 50 % higher flux. So, one UF unit gives significantly different treated volumes (m3/d). For printing paper, ultrafiltration requires electricity in the range of 2.6 kWh/m3 of treated white water and approximately 4.7 kWh/m3 for RCF-based Testliner/fluting mills.\n\nA possible reduction of water consumption can indirectly lead to a decrease of the discharged nutrients load (N and P) because the total N and P releases are governed by the minimum concentration that is required for the growth of biomass in waste water treatment plants.\n\nFor membrane filtration, the solution as to how to treat the liquid or solid wastes is crucial. In full-scale UF applications, the concentrate from membrane filtration (3 - 5 % of the feed) is further treated in the biological treatment plant. In this case, no reduction of the total solid load to the receiving water body is achieved. However, investigations into whether to treat the concentrate separately are still being carried out.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUF could be applied on super clear filtrate or on biotreated water from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). The treatment of excess white water with UF membrane filtration for reuse at wire section showers has become a proven and accepted technique at paper and board mills when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. Ultrafiltrated water has also been used for press section showers, but this application is still only used in special cases due to the UF only partially removing the dissolved materials.\n\nThis technique is also applicable in RCF-based mills and has already been proved with full-scale applications (e.g. Modern Karton Sanayi Ticaret AS in Corlu, Turkey; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany).\n\nFor process water with higher concentrations of organic substances, like that from the production of 'brown paper' from recycled fibre, biological treatment followed by sand filtration is another feasible option when the fresh water consumption level has to be low. It allows for the partial recycling of water from the long circulation. This technique is described in Section 6.3.4. \n\nThere are also combined systems under development, 'membrane bio-reactors' (MBR) as described in Section 2.9.11.2.1. In special applications, such as coating chemical recovery from paper machine coating effluents, UF membrane technology is already a tested technology and several applications exist (see Section 7.3.5).\n\nIn general terms, paper machine water loop closure with self-contained removal of dissolved organic or inorganic constituents is a technique that is still undergoing some development. It is not as well established as biological treatment for example.\nEconomics\nThe operating costs of ultrafiltration depend on the energy price and on the achieved flux (filtrated volume per membrane surface and hour). Assuming electricity costs of EUR 0.05/kWh, the following operational costs can be calculated:\n\nRCF Testliner/fluting based on old corrugated container (175 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.42 per m3;\nprinting paper (300 l/m2 x h): EUR 0.25 per m3. \n\nAn example calculation for the operational costs of UF of white water of a printing paper mill that manufactures 350 000 tonnes/yr is given in Table   7 .186 (data from a supplier, 2010). The membrane treatment capacity is 3.0 m3/t, which corresponds to 126 m3/h or 300 l/m2h.\n\n\nTable 7.186:\tExample calculation for operational costs of ultrafiltration of white water from printing paper production\n\n\nAlthough membrane filtration consumes energy, in some cases savings can be achieved with regard to the dryer section energy consumption. When fresh water consumption decreases, the process temperature increases. It is easier to remove water and to achieve better web dryness after the press section and thus less heating energy is needed at the dryer section.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMembrane filtration may be applied in mills which face strict requirements for discharge either because they are situated near a sensitive recipient or because there are plans for a significant increase in capacity. Some authorities in Europe require that the effluent load does not increase with capacity. UF technology may also be applied in cases where availability of water is scarce. \n\nUF of white water may also reduce the downtime of the paper machine caused by the required washing off of substances concentrated in the recycled clear filtrate.\n\nExample plants\nMembrane filtration of process waters is applied in about six European pulp and paper mills, however there is no reference from a 'totally closed' mill. These membrane applications are mostly on white water clear filtrates with the objective of reducing fresh water demand. Example plants are the Sappi Kirkniemi mill (magazine and fine paper production), Finland; UPM-Kymmene Tervasaari mill (released paper), Finland; Holmen Paper Madrid, (newsprint), Spain; Modern Karton Liner/Fluting mill, Turkey; Hokuetsu Mill (fine paper), Japan; Propapier Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany.\n\nIn the US, there are closed-cycle paper mills with membrane technology in combination with biological treatment (McKinley linerboard paper company, New Mexico, US).\nReference literature\n, , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3981746_abstract", "x": 0.61508495, "y": 0.32309392, "title": "WATER TREATMENT METHOD AND EQUIPMENT FOR PERFORMING THIS METHOD", "year": 2022, "text": "The invention relates to a water treatment method, especially to drinking, technology, utility, feed and industrial, consisting of filtration, coagulation and flocculation where the inlet water is subjected to pressure coagulation and flocculation, and then it is filtered through a membrane filter, wherein pH and light absorbance are measured, and then pH and light absorbance are adjusted at the water inflow before pressure coagulation and flocculation.

Thus small bacteria and colloids escape the filter media. However, this is only true for unflocculated solids and colloids. They can also be transformed into 100 - 1 000 mm flocs by flocculation and can be easily filtered off. But the addition of flocculants may have the drawback of undesirable salts being introduced into the water system (modern organic/synthetic flocculants do not introduce a significant salt burden).\n\nMembrane technologies, depending on the applicable membrane cut-off size (corresponding to the approximate 'molecular weight' of the organic compounds removed) and filtering pressure, can theoretically remove almost 100 % of the organic material (see Figure   7 .297) without introducing undesirable compounds into the water circuits.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.297:\tFiltration ranges of different filtration technologies\n\n\n\nAccording to the differences in pore size, different membrane processes can be distinguished:\n\nMicro-filtration (Micro-filtration (MF)), which operates at below 1 bar pressure and uses membranes with 0.1 - 0.2 mm pore size, could be used where 1 - 5 mg/l of very fine solids is acceptable after treatment.\nUltrafiltration (UF) operates at 1 - 2 bar pressure difference and is regarded a possible solution for 100 % removal of residual solids and colloids and high molecular weight organics from pulp and paper mills' water or effluent streams. In Europe, a few full-scale applications for white water treatment with UF technology exist. \nNano-filtration (Nano-filtration (NF)) or reverse osmosis (Reverse Osmosis (RO)) use pressures reaching 15 - 25 bars, but so far these methods have not been seriously considered for full-scale use in the pulp and paper industry in Europe (there is one full-scale application in the High Desert of north-western New Mexico).\n\nAny type of membrane filtration cannot handle sudden peaks of suspended solids. If the suspended solids are homogeneous, only a police filter is needed to avoid sudden peaks. \n\nKey issues affecting the selection of a membrane technology are as follows:\n\nInput stream, its composition and hydraulic load, including peak operating conditions.\nClean water quantity and quality required and the applicability of treatment output in varying operating conditions for intended end uses and the effect on pulp or paper quality.\nHigh-pressure filtration methods produce cleaner water, but consume more electricity and must be sized larger or equipped with more efficient pretreatment or counter-measures to protect against plugging.\nMaintenance requirements (symmetric or asymmetric membrane structure, washing with acids or alkaline solutions, spare capacity, automated or continuous cleaning). Symmetric membranes have a higher tendency to plug. Plugging can be avoided by maintaining highly turbulent conditions close to the membrane wall, but this requires somewhat more energy.\nFinal treatment and disposal of the concentrate or sludge, which in most cases is waste. Liquid waste may be concentrated enough to cause toxic effects at an effluent treatment or it may require further concentration or absorption into a solid fuel for disposal by incineration. Some inorganic salts in the concentrate are corrosive, which must be taken into account in the selection of equipment and piping materials.\n\nWhen considering these aspects, UF can be used as a kidney to handle disturbing matter in the white water and close the water system further. \n\nFor in-line white water treatment, the kidneys consist of a common disc filter, a pre-filter (pressure screen or bow screen) for the removal of long fibres that could harm the membranes and the UF system. The rejects from the pre-filters are recycled back to the process. Optionally, the cloudy filtrate can also be sent to the UF feed together with clear filtrate. This is for cases where the clear filtrate is so clean (Suspended Solids (SS) <20 mg/l) that some additional solids are beneficial to filtration by keeping the cross-flow membrane surface cleaner. Normally, the pre-filtered clear filtrate is piped to the UF system's feed tank and pumped into the UF unit. The number of filters in operation regulate the clean UF permeate capacity. The pressure difference is kept as low as possible at, for instance, 0.7 - 0.8 bars. The quality of the UF filtrate is sufficient for use as, for example, high-pressure (High-pressure (HP)) shower water, sealing water and for the dilution of chemical additives. The concentrate from the filters can be piped to the main effluent treatment. A possible layout for an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification is shown in Figure   7 .298.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.298:\tPossible layout of an integrated paper mill using ultrafiltration for white water purification\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nUF technology is today commonly applied when fresh water consumption is to be decreased or when the hydraulic discharge load (not the organic load) needs to be reduced. By replacing warm fresh water with ultrafiltrated white water from the paper machine, a fresh water reduction of about 2 - 4 m3/t of paper is normally achieved.\n\nUltrafiltration in white water applications usually means the treatment of clear filtrate and/or parts of the cloudy filtrate from the disc filter. The UF membranes in practice remove 100 % of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 99 % of bacteria, 100 % of turbidity (all colloidal material is removed), and 45 - 70 % of anionicity. Dissolved Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is lowered by about 10 - 20 %. This means that UF still allows parts of the organic substances (e.g. all low molecular weight organics) and soluble inorganic matter to pass through. First of all, UF of white water gives better quality recirculated water which can be used for low- and high-pressure shower water in the wire section, dilution water for chemicals, press section lubrication water or other washing and cleaning purposes. There is not yet experience of using the permeate for felt cleaning.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nMembrane treatment processes used specifically for paper or board machines' white water have been tested basically at full scale for all common paper grades.

Usually, tertiary treatment is used when the nutrients, colour or Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the treated waste waters have to be reduced beyond Best Available Techniques (BAT) levels (e.g. for a very sensitive receiving water body) or the disturbance effects of temporary overflows have to be prevented. It is also used to improve the efficiency of waste water treatment (e.g. in the case of aerated lagoons). Low reduction efficiencies for phosphorus and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in aerated lagoons in wintertime can be improved.\n\nExample plants\nBiological treatment plus chemical flotation of waste water from the manufacturing of kraft pulp is used at some plants in Sweden, e.g. Skoghall, Billingfors, Backhammar or Iggesund.

Another advanced waste water treatment process (tertiary treatment) is described in Section 7.3.12 (chemical precipitation).\n\nDescription and achieved environmental benefits\nBiological treatment of waste water from paper mills is the standard treatment method in most European paper mills thus reducing emissions to water significantly (see Section 6.3.7 and 6.3.8). In some cases, the best possible biological elimination of organic substances is not good enough to protect the receiving water body. Then, an advanced treatment of remaining pollutants after biological treatment is necessary that aims at a further reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), AOX, colour and Total Suspended Solids (TSS).\n\nOzone treatment - unless partial flows can be successfully pretreated - is normally applied most effectively and economically downstream of the biological stage. A combination of ozonation with fixed bed biofilm reactors reduces Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), colour and AOX, not readiliy degradable optical brighteners and chelating agents and bacteria depending on the amount of ozone applied. The layout of the ozone installation at SCA Laakirchen, AT, is shown in Figure   6 .259.\n\nFigure 6.259:\tLayout of the ozonation stage with a subsequent biofilter\n\n\nThis process layout prevents full oxidation of organic matter by ozonation thus reducing the amount of required ozone and optimising the operational costs. The target of this layout is not to consume ozone for readily biodegradable matter but to only oxidise the persistent organic matter.\n\nOzonation is applied in two full-scale applications in Europe (AT, DE) to a completely biodegraded effluent, i.e. with low BOD concentrations. However, the persistent organic compounds are still at a level that is considered to be too high for the receiving water body. The process system chosen allows for parts of the persistent organic compounds (residual Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), AOX, and colour) to be transformed into biodegradable fractions. The combination of ozonation and subsequent biofiltration makes use of this effect of partial oxidation by limiting the use of expensive chemical oxidants (O3) to the amount necessary to meet the targets. The partially oxidised compounds, now biodegradable, are then eliminated in the subsequent bioreactor. Figure   6 .260 shows this effect. The three pairs of columns show the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and BOD5 gradient during ozonation, biofiltration and at the discharge point for a daily sampling with a specific ozone input of 0.15 kg O3/kg CODinflow.\n\nFigure 6.260: \tDevelopment of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and BOD5 concentration during ozonation and biofiltration\n\n\nDue to the relatively low concentrations of biodegradable compounds following the partial oxidation (BOD5 <50 mg/l), for the subsequent biotreatment only biofilm reactors are used, which give good results.\n\nThis type of advanced treatment is able to eliminate Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) by 60 % (single stage) to up to 85 % (two stages), related to the waste water after biological treatment, with a specific ozone consumption of 0.4 - 1.0 kg/kgCODeliminated. Operational costs of a plant like this will be EUR 0.3 - 0.4/m3 of treated effluent (2009 data from Lang Ettringen paper mill, DE), depending on the type of waste water and the size and technical standard of the plant.\n\nApart from the enhanced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal, depending on the pretreatment and the O3 dosing, ozonation may also reduce the colour of the effluent, the adsorbable organic compounds (AOX), the poorly biodegradable chelating agents such as DTPA and EDTA and the toxicity of the effluent (if it is still relevant). Ozonation can also be used for the disinfection of the treated waste water .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAt the SCA Laakirchen paper mill, AT, the combination of ozonation and subsequent biofiltration is applied to meet the following objectives:\n\nenhanced Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction, which cannot be obtained by using conventional mechanical and biological treatment alone;\ncontrollability of the additional Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction and elimination of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) peaks which accompany special production situations (high brightness grades);\nreduction of operational costs by tailored dosing of ozone to Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) peak loads in the biologically treated water and the combination of ozonation and subsequent biofiltration;\ndecolourisation of waste water.\n\nThe higher residual Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) peaks (up to 40 % higher) normally occur when the high brightness grades are manufactured (more intensive bleaching of groundwood pulp associated with more poorly biodegradable chemical additives, more NaOH, peroxide, chelating agents and more poorly degradable Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)). The ozonation-biofiltration allows the treatment to be applied in such a way that the predictable peaks are eliminated (compensated) and the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) target values are met. By this means, the additional costs are reduced. Figure   6 .261 shows the typical production and emission data over a complete year (2008) before and after ozonation-biofiltration. It shows that without ozonation the permitted limit values would not be met on many days of the year. The purple line at the bottom of the figure shows the production time intervals when the share of higher brightness grades is increased (more intensively bleached groundwood pulp). The manufacturing of higher brightness grades (73 - 80 ISO % instead of 67 - 68 ISO % for standard grades) is associated with higher initial Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) loads (approximately 50 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/t intensively bleached GWP instead of approximately 35 kg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/t bleached standard GWP). The pink line at the top shows the daily Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load before entering the ozonation stage. The shape of this line basically follows the purple line. The blue line shows the daily Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load after ozonation-biofiltration. It shows that the adjustment of the treatment system allows for effectively meeting the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) emission targets (indicated as maximum allowed Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) value and 80th percentile, see red and orange horizontal lines).\n\n\nFigure 6.261:\tTypical production and emission data before and after ozonation and biofiltration\n\n\nAt the paper mill in Gmund, DE, ozonation is used as internal treatment. White water from the manufacturing of a large variety of coloured grades is recovered and the suspended solids are removed in a pressure disc filter. The coloured white water then enters an ozonation step where it is decoloured and subsequently sent to a storage tank. From there it is recirculated to the process and used for different purposes. Thus, water consumption has been reduced by 50 %.\n\nCross-media effects\nWith the exception of the small amount of biological excess sludge produced in the biofilters, polluting substances are really eliminated and not only separated. Therefore, this treatment does not generate a concentrate that requires further treatment, as is the case when membranes or evaporation are used. \n\nNegative cross-media effects are the energy consumption for the ozone generator, which is in the range of 10 - 13 kWh/kg ozone, and a smaller amount of energy consumption for the production of pure oxygen. Furthermore, power is needed for the aeration pumps of the biofilter and its backwashing.\n\nBased on the 2005 production (30 % high brightness grades) and cost data (for energy and oxygen), an example of the annual average energy consumption of this advanced treatment is given .\n\n\n\nEnergy consumption related to CODeliminated:\nBiological treatment:\t\t\t1.5 kWh/kg CODeliminated\nOzone treatment:\t\t\t20.8 kWh/kg CODeliminated\nOxygen consumption for ozonation:\t7.9 kg O2/kg CODeliminated.\n\nEnergy consumption related to gross paper production:\nBiological treatment:\t\t\t18.9 kWh/tonne of paper (gross)\nOzone treatment:\t\t\t7.5 kWh /tonne of paper (gross)\nOxygen consumption for ozonation:\t2.8 kg O2/ tonne of paper (gross).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nPrincipally, this treatment is applicable to all effluents where the residual Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) levels are still too high to be discharged (see Figure   6 .261). The ozone-treated water can then be either discharged or reused in the production process. At the Lang paper mill, DE, a similar concept to that used at Laakirchen is applied.\n\nDecrease of the colour of the ozonated waste water results in better possibilities for reuse of the treated effluent in the paper mill. For the application of an ozone step for decolourisation and partial recirculation of the decoloured process water, an almost complete and stable fibre recovery before the ozonation is crucial. A partial rearrangement of the water system of the mill is associated with this application.\n\nEconomics\nIn comparison with other advanced treatment techniques such as flocculation/precipitation, ozone treatment provides an economically viable alternative under certain conditions. Ozone treatment can also achieve a more or less complete colour stripping at reasonable costs.\n\nThe investment costs in 2004 for the advanced treatment shown in Figure   6 .261 were EUR 7.6 million (Source: Informationsfolder zur Klaranlage SCA-Laakirchen, 'High tech fur eine saubere Traun').\n\nThe operational costs depend to a large extent on the targeted Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction. It is less informative to express the specific treatment costs per m3 of treated effluent, as the ozone demand depends exclusively on the organic substance to be oxidised (e.g. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load). It is therefore more meaningful to report operational costs related to the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load eliminated. Based on the 2005 production (30 % high brightness grades) and cost data (for energy and oxygen) and the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction described under 'Environmental performance and operational data', the following data on operational costs  give an impression of the order of magnitude of the costs:\n\nbiological Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) reduction: EUR 0.27/kg CODeliminated,\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) elimination O3 + biofilter: EUR 1.33/kg CODeliminated,\nbiological waste water treatment: approximately EUR 3.7/tonne of paper,\nozonation + biofiltration: EUR 0.53/tonne of paper.\n\nAlthough the costs for the elimination of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) by use of advanced treatment (ozonation and subsequent biofiltration) are considerably higher than those for conventional biological treatment only, it should be noted that the additional costs per tonne of paper are less significant as the readily biodegradable organic matter is already completely eliminated before the ozonation step. This allows the ozone dosage and the operational costs to be kept at a lower level. Thus, the ozone is effectively directed towards the poorly biodegradable organic substances.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nWhen the elimination of organic substances after two-stage biological treatment is not sufficient, ozonation with subsequent biofiltration is a stable and reliable option. Advanced effluent treatment is normally applied at mills that are located at sensitive or very small receiving water bodies. It is also applied by mills which significantly increase their capacity and have no permit for increasing the load of effluent to the river accordingly. Advanced effluent treatment allows for compensating for higher organic loads caused by the manufacturing of higher brightness grades.\n\nExample plants\nSCA Laakirchen (ozonation for reduction of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) peak emissions), AT; Myllykoski Lang Papier Ettringen (ozonation for Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load reduction), DE; Papierfabrik Gmund (decolourisation of process water before discharge and partial recirculation), DE.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n, .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4023972_abstract", "x": 0.7716874, "y": 0.38256302, "title": "REFRIGERATOR", "year": 2022, "text": "A refrigerator (100) includes a storage compartment (101) and an air sanitation device (1) mounted on a top wall (1001) of the storage compartment.

Accordingly, the NOX formation in the black liquor recovery boiler is lower than from other furnaces. Modifications to the air systems have proved successful with respect to NOX reductions.\n\nOn top of the conventional air feeding levels (commonly three), an additional air feeding level (fourth air level) positioned at a higher elevation from the boiler floor is incorporated in the boiler. Many black liquor recovery boilers have four air feeding levels, some even have five. Modifying the air feed system by introducing additional air inlets in the upper part of the boiler reduces NOX formation.\n\nThe reduction of NOX emissions with air staging depends on the black liquor recovery boiler design and load, and the Nitric Oxide (NO) emission level and will normally be 10 - 25 %.\n\nAdditional air levels above the conventional ones provide more freedom for managing Nitric Oxide (NO) emissions with combustion technology.\n\nIt has become apparent that Nitric Oxide (NO) reduction techniques based on optimising air distribution are not efficient if the boiler load is very high, as is the case at several pulp mills . On the other hand, all retrofitted or more recently built black liquor recovery boilers for which low NOX emissions were reported have several air levels. No more specific data about the success of specific air distribution systems have been provided.\nAchieved environmental benefits\nLower NOX emissions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe reduction of NOX emissions attributable to the use of this technique is variable and depends on several factors. In many cases, about 10 - 25 % lower NOX emissions have been reached \n, . In contrast, for example, the IP kraft pulp mill in Saillat, France, reported that the introduction of a fourth air level did not result in any significant NOX reductions (no data about boiler load or further details were provided). The technique has to be adapted to the specific conditions of black liquor recovery boilers.\n\nThe achievements of two kraft pulp mills that have implemented advanced air systems and are running a fourth air level are shown in Figure   3 .121 and Figure   3 .122 as examples. \n\nThe first example is a European kraft pulp mill that uses softwood (pine and spruce) as pulpwood. The black liquor recovery boiler runs slightly below the design capacity and has a fourth air level. In the black liquor recovery boiler, black liquor (approximately 75 % Dry Solids (DS)), natural gas and light fuel oil as supporting fuel and Dilute Non-condensable Gases (DNCG) are burnt. The emission concentrations for NOX and CO are shown in Figure   3 .121. In the filled-in questionnaires, the mill reported an emission level of 1.25 kg NOX/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) on an annual basis for the recovery boiler.\n\n\nFigure 3.121:\tContinuously measured daily average data for the NOX and CO emissions of a black liquor recovery boiler\n\n\nThe second example is the Sodra Varo kraft pulp mill in Sweden that uses softwood (spruce and pine) as pulpwood. The recovery boiler has a fourth air level. In the black liquor recovery boiler, black liquor (approximately 75 % Dry Solids (DS)), some fossil fuel and Dilute Non-condensable Gases (DNCG) are burnt. The achieved emission levels for NOX and CO are shown in Figure   3 .122. The yearly average emission concentration corresponds to a specific NOX emission from the black liquor recovery boiler of 1.02 kg/Air Dry Tonnes (ADt) on an annual basis.\n\nFigure 3.122:\tContinuously measured daily average data for the NOX and CO emissions of the recovery boiler of the Sodra Varo kraft pulp mill\n\n\nNewer recovery boilers where the combustion air is distributed through four or more air registers can achieve levels down to below 150 mg NOX/Nm3 (at 3 % O2) or under 1 kg NOX/t in some cases (see Figure   3 .86 ). \n\nA very exact process control is required to prevent an increase of CO formation during lean-oxygen combustion. In order to reduce NOX emissions, black liquor recovery boilers are operated at low oxygen levels. Oxygen levels of 2.5 - 3 % in the exhaust gas are typical. An increase in excess O2 may increase NOX.\n\nCross-media effects\nNo cross-media effects occur.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to both new and existing mills. This technique will require considerable changes to the air feed systems of the furnace and in certain cases the special furnace wall tubes that can withstand corrosion in a reducing atmosphere would have to be extended from the lower part of the boiler to the highest air level, which would be a significant alteration in a boiler. The size and dimensions of the boiler may restrict the applicability of this measure in some cases.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required for modifying the air introduction to the recovery boiler of a bleached kraft mill with a production capacity between 250 000 and 500 000 tonnes/year amounts to EUR 1.7 million and EUR 2.3 million respectively. The investment includes new air inlets to the recovery boiler, instrumentation, pipes and fans. There is a small change in operating costs (installing an additional fan slightly increases the electricity consumption).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nNOX has an acidifying potential and may increase eutrophication. In some sensitive lake areas in Europe a further reduction of NOX emissions by primary measures is therefore regarded as necessary. \n\n\n\nExample plants\nMany black liquor recovery boilers have four air levels, several secondary and tertiary elevations or vertical air systems on new and existing boilers.\n\nReference literature\n, , , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3492559_abstract", "x": 0.60598785, "y": 0.18657841, "title": "METHODS FOR RENEWABLE FUEL", "year": 2019, "text": "The present application generally relates to the introduction of a renewable fuel oil as a feedstock into refinery systems or field upgrading equipment.

The bubble concept is a regulatory tool applied in several EU countries. As represented in the picture below, the bubble approach for emissions to air reflects a \"virtual single stack\" for the whole refinery. The treatment of process water in the refinery is typically done in a single waste water treatment plant (for technical and economical reasons) and conceptually can be regarded as a similar approach to the \"bubble concept\" for air. \n\n\nFigure 4.50:\tThe bubble concept\n\n\nWhy is it applied to refineries?\nThe bubble concept is used for refineries because it is recognised that they meet some or all of their energy needs with a variety of gaseous and liquid fuels that are by-products of the various processes. In this respect, refineries differ from other industries that generally buy all their specified fuels from outside.\n\nThe technical justification of the bubble concept in refineries is the complexity of the installation. Aspects of this complexity include the number of emission points and the technical and economic interrelationships in a modern refinery between feedstock, types of processes and the variations in different operating conditions in relation to product slate and product quality requirements.\n\nThe economic justification is that the refinery should be allowed to use, at different plants and at different times, the various fuels it produces in-house. At the same time, it enables the operator to:\n\nchoose the most cost-effective place to reduce emissions\nrespond to opportunities in the crude oil market and the supply & demand situation for oil products\noperate effectively in a competitive environment. \n\nThe environmental justification is that the authority should be allowed to define emission conditions in line with its environmental targets while allowing the refinery operator flexibility in the operation of its processing units and in the selection of the various technical and economic options to fulfil the energy requirements of the refinery in competitive market conditions. Moreover, it allows easy comparison of the emission performance of a refinery and between refineries. \n\nDefinition and applicability\nFor the application of the bubble concept, the associated emission levels need to be given in a transparent way. This includes:\n1. the pollutants involved\n2. the approach used to define the bubble (concentration bubble and load bubble). (See below)\n3. a comprehensive list of installations included in the bubble concept (see below)\n4. the corresponding flue gas volumes and their measurement conditions (e.g. under standard conditions, dry)\n5. reference data (oxygen content and averaging time (daily, monthly, yearly, 3-yearly)) (see below)\n\nFollows explanations of the above points:\n\nSelf-explanatory (See Description in this Section)\n\nDifferent approaches (point 2 above) can be used to define the bubble, i.e: \nin a concentration units of the flue gas emitted by the refinery, whereby the complexity of the refinery is reflected in the energy consumption of the refinery, or\nin a annual load per tonne of crude oil processed which can be combined with the complexity factor (Nelson index) of the refinery\n\nThe load bubble includes energy efficiency of a refinery and the concentration approach does not. This is the major advantage of the load bubble. There are simplified factors (See Table 3.2) for switching between the two approaches. It should be notised that such a factor calculated on an average European energy consumption value could, however, be misleading because energy efficiencies in European refineries vary greatly (See Section 3.10.1). The conversion between the two approaches in each specific refinery is more accurate.\n\nOther methods may be used. It is more a question of convenience and custom than of principle how and in which units of measurement the bubble is defined, as long as it is clear which approach is used, which methodology is used to define the unit of measurement and which units are included. \n\nThere are different interpretations in various countries of the units to be considered (e.g. combustion only, including or excluding Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) and/or Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and/or flares). As an example, a Member State has reported that for an existing EU+ refinery the bubble concentration increases by 20% when flares are included in the bubble. Another example was given by Concawe were the calculated average of the SO2 fuel bubble was 1000 whereas the average was 1600 if all installations are included within the bubble.\n\nSelf-explanatory\n\nWhen the short averaging time is defined (e.g. daily, monthly), additional flexibility for outages, changes of feedstock and other technical problems may be granted by allowing the high values in the current period to be corrected by lower values in the next period, when the technical problems have been sorted out. The mass bubble limit (g/tonne crude oil processed) is typically defined over a long period (e.g. one year). In one EU+ refinery, a period of three years is applied. Also, it has been recognised by the Technical Working Group (TWG) that the averaging time may depend on the pollutant. (e.g. environmental and health effects of NOx and SOx are different). The averaging period is also related to the stringency of the bubble emission level (the more stringent the levels, the longer the averaging period, to allow flexibility).\n\nThe above paragraphs imply that a large amount of data is needed to continuously calculate the bubble value. For example, for SO2:\nRefinery Fuel Gas (RFG) sulphur contents need to be continually measured (e.g. by mass spectrometer) and hourly values produced; SO2 is then calculated by recording hourly fuel flows to furnaces and boilers.\nFuel oil S content is measured daily.\nFluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) figures are estimated based on a percentage of the S feed to the unit (the daily flow of feed to the unit; the S content is measured after any change of crude slate). This needs months of data collection to establish a relationship.\nSRUs, calciners etc all have different algorithms to estimate releases continously based on data collection.\nData are also needed to continuously estimate moisture and O2 content in the flue gases to correct to the reference conditions.\n\nThe last paragraph indicates the scope for considerable variability in the way refiners calculate the bubble and thus in the accuracy and reliability of the data when comparing bubble values. However when a good sample schedule is establish together with an approved calculation method, the follow up of the emissions become very easy. \n\nEnvironmental concerns\nAs in some situations refineries are physically or logistically connected to a nearby chemical plant, there may be a temptation to extend the bubble to the \"non-refinery\" processes which then may create misuse of the bubble concept because of dilution effects. These dilution effects can occur due to the high volumes of flue gases generated by some non-refinery processes that typically contain low levels of SO2 and NOx. An example of such dilution was submitted by a Member State where a refinery bubble profits from a large chemical plant and the bubble concentration is reduced by 50% (included in the LVOC BREF). Dilution effects do not affect the load approach.\n\nA second concern may be that the concentration bubble is defined as a relative standard, directly related to the fuel use in the refinery, and therefore not enhancing efficient use of energy in the refinery. This can be addressed by defining the bubble according to a load per tonne of crude oil processed or by defining an absolute ceiling (in tonnes/year), in addition to emission values in mg/Nm3 flue gas in the bubble. However, there is a possible trade-off between the stringency of the environmental requirements and the need for flexibility in the operation of a refinery. Special care should be taken not to introduce additional complexity into the regulatory system, thereby losing part of the attractiveness of the bubble concept. For example, in a MS a 3-year average is chosen for the SO2 bubble (load) for the refinery. In the case of NOx, however, the differences in long-term environmental and health effects of SO2 and NOx need to be borne in mind.\n\nAnother possible environmental concern with this concept, is the possibility of high emissions at the lower stacks (e.g. Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU)). This can easily be redressed by requiring that the flue gases of the cleaner fuels be discharged at the lower stacks and the high stacks are used to avoid high concentrations of pollutants at ground level, affecting workers and the neighbourhood. Of course, the regulator should be aware that traditional measures used to ensure that ground level concentrations of hazardous pollutants are within Air Quality Standards are still required when using the bubble concept. This comment can be extended to all legislation, because the use of the bubble concept as a regulatory tool does not prevent other existing/new limit values for specific units/facilities within the refinery for being applied.\n\nEstablishing associated emission values in the bubble concept\nIf the bubble concept is to be used as an instrument to enforce the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the refinery, then the emission values defined in the refinery bubble should be such that they indeed reflect Best Available Techniques (BAT) performance for the refinery as a whole. The most important notion is then to: \nidentify the total fuel use of the refinery;\nassess the contribution of each of the fuels to the total fuel consumption of the refinery;\nquantify the emissions from process units implicated in such emissions (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC), Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU));\nreview the applicability of Best Available Techniques (BAT) to each of these fuels and/or the process units \ncombine this information with the technical and economical constraints in using these techniques.\n\nThis may imply different emission values associated with the use of Best Available Techniques (BAT), depending on the type of fuels used and their contribution to the total refinery fuel use, together with emissions of process units such as the Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) and the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and their contribution to the total refinery emissions. \n\nAssociated emission values in the case of a gas-fired refinery will be inherently lower than the emissions in a situation where a major part of the fuel use of the refinery is provided by liquid fuels. In this latter case Best Available Techniques (BAT) may be defined by assessing the emissions associated with the gaseous fuels used in combination with the emissions associated with using liquid residual fuels and flue gas treatment, or using clean liquid fuels, i.e. gas oil with limited S-content. If deemed necessary, these emission values for a bubble based on concentrations can easily be translated into a yearly or monthly load bubble, i.e. tonne of SO2 and/or NOx per million tonnes of crude oil processed.\n\nIn Annex V, several examples show how, emission values for the bubble concept can be defined which reflect the SO2 and NOx performance that is technically feasible for the refinery as a whole. The assessment of Best Available Techniques (BAT)-associated emission values involves however also an economic and an environmental assessment of these values. The investment decision to convert an existing refinery into a full conversion, gas-fired refinery involves much more technical, economic and environmental considerations than only the SO2 and NOx emissions from the refinery itself. Similarly, the decision to invest in flue gas desulphurisation and/or NOx abatement via Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) may also involve the concentration of liquid fuel firing of the refinery in one or two larger combustion plants, which will have major implications on the way the refinery will be able to respond to commercial pressures. The same holds true for the other technical options that a refinery will be faced with. However, maximum flexibility will be high on the agenda in assessing the various technical considerations open to the refinery. By defining emission values in the bubble that respect this need for operational flexibility, the permitting authority can support the proper environmental outcome of the investment decision process by the refinery\n\nThe bubble concept is an environmental regulatory instrument that may be used to enforce the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the refinery without becoming entangled in the complex technical-economic interrelationships in the refinery. As mentioned before, there is a link to the Best Available Techniques (BAT) concept provided that the bubble is set at a level that reflects Best Available Techniques (BAT) performance of the refinery as a whole. \n\n\nExamples\nTechnical Working Group (TWG) has provided some reference numbers when bubble concept is applied to refineries.

The bubble concept is a regulatory tool applied in several EU countries. As represented in the picture below, the bubble approach for emissions to air reflects a \"virtual single stack\" for the whole refinery. The treatment of process water in the refinery is typically done in a single waste water treatment plant (for technical and economical reasons) and conceptually can be regarded as a similar approach to the \"bubble concept\" for air. \n\n\nFigure 4.50:\tThe bubble concept\n\n\nWhy is it applied to refineries?\nThe bubble concept is used for refineries because it is recognised that they meet some or all of their energy needs with a variety of gaseous and liquid fuels that are by-products of the various processes. In this respect, refineries differ from other industries that generally buy all their specified fuels from outside.\n\nThe technical justification of the bubble concept in refineries is the complexity of the installation. Aspects of this complexity include the number of emission points and the technical and economic interrelationships in a modern refinery between feedstock, types of processes and the variations in different operating conditions in relation to product slate and product quality requirements.\n\nThe economic justification is that the refinery should be allowed to use, at different plants and at different times, the various fuels it produces in-house. At the same time, it enables the operator to:\n\nchoose the most cost-effective place to reduce emissions\nrespond to opportunities in the crude oil market and the supply & demand situation for oil products\noperate effectively in a competitive environment. \n\nThe environmental justification is that the authority should be allowed to define emission conditions in line with its environmental targets while allowing the refinery operator flexibility in the operation of its processing units and in the selection of the various technical and economic options to fulfil the energy requirements of the refinery in competitive market conditions. Moreover, it allows easy comparison of the emission performance of a refinery and between refineries. \n\nDefinition and applicability\nFor the application of the bubble concept, the associated emission levels need to be given in a transparent way. This includes:\n1. the pollutants involved\n2. the approach used to define the bubble (concentration bubble and load bubble). (See below)\n3. a comprehensive list of installations included in the bubble concept (see below)\n4. the corresponding flue gas volumes and their measurement conditions (e.g. under standard conditions, dry)\n5. reference data (oxygen content and averaging time (daily, monthly, yearly, 3-yearly)) (see below)\n\nFollows explanations of the above points:\n\nSelf-explanatory (See Description in this Section)\n\nDifferent approaches (point 2 above) can be used to define the bubble, i.e: \nin a concentration units of the flue gas emitted by the refinery, whereby the complexity of the refinery is reflected in the energy consumption of the refinery, or\nin a annual load per tonne of crude oil processed which can be combined with the complexity factor (Nelson index) of the refinery\n\nThe load bubble includes energy efficiency of a refinery and the concentration approach does not. This is the major advantage of the load bubble. There are simplified factors (See Table 3.2) for switching between the two approaches. It should be notised that such a factor calculated on an average European energy consumption value could, however, be misleading because energy efficiencies in European refineries vary greatly (See Section 3.10.1). The conversion between the two approaches in each specific refinery is more accurate.\n\nOther methods may be used. It is more a question of convenience and custom than of principle how and in which units of measurement the bubble is defined, as long as it is clear which approach is used, which methodology is used to define the unit of measurement and which units are included. \n\nThere are different interpretations in various countries of the units to be considered (e.g. combustion only, including or excluding Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) and/or Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and/or flares). As an example, a Member State has reported that for an existing EU+ refinery the bubble concentration increases by 20% when flares are included in the bubble. Another example was given by Concawe were the calculated average of the SO2 fuel bubble was 1000 whereas the average was 1600 if all installations are included within the bubble.\n\nSelf-explanatory\n\nWhen the short averaging time is defined (e.g. daily, monthly), additional flexibility for outages, changes of feedstock and other technical problems may be granted by allowing the high values in the current period to be corrected by lower values in the next period, when the technical problems have been sorted out. The mass bubble limit (g/tonne crude oil processed) is typically defined over a long period (e.g. one year). In one EU+ refinery, a period of three years is applied. Also, it has been recognised by the Technical Working Group (TWG) that the averaging time may depend on the pollutant. (e.g. environmental and health effects of NOx and SOx are different). The averaging period is also related to the stringency of the bubble emission level (the more stringent the levels, the longer the averaging period, to allow flexibility).\n\nThe above paragraphs imply that a large amount of data is needed to continuously calculate the bubble value. For example, for SO2:\nRefinery Fuel Gas (RFG) sulphur contents need to be continually measured (e.g. by mass spectrometer) and hourly values produced; SO2 is then calculated by recording hourly fuel flows to furnaces and boilers.\nFuel oil S content is measured daily.\nFluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) figures are estimated based on a percentage of the S feed to the unit (the daily flow of feed to the unit; the S content is measured after any change of crude slate). This needs months of data collection to establish a relationship.\nSRUs, calciners etc all have different algorithms to estimate releases continously based on data collection.\nData are also needed to continuously estimate moisture and O2 content in the flue gases to correct to the reference conditions.\n\nThe last paragraph indicates the scope for considerable variability in the way refiners calculate the bubble and thus in the accuracy and reliability of the data when comparing bubble values. However when a good sample schedule is establish together with an approved calculation method, the follow up of the emissions become very easy. \n\nEnvironmental concerns\nAs in some situations refineries are physically or logistically connected to a nearby chemical plant, there may be a temptation to extend the bubble to the \"non-refinery\" processes which then may create misuse of the bubble concept because of dilution effects. These dilution effects can occur due to the high volumes of flue gases generated by some non-refinery processes that typically contain low levels of SO2 and NOx. An example of such dilution was submitted by a Member State where a refinery bubble profits from a large chemical plant and the bubble concentration is reduced by 50% (included in the LVOC BREF). Dilution effects do not affect the load approach.\n\nA second concern may be that the concentration bubble is defined as a relative standard, directly related to the fuel use in the refinery, and therefore not enhancing efficient use of energy in the refinery. This can be addressed by defining the bubble according to a load per tonne of crude oil processed or by defining an absolute ceiling (in tonnes/year), in addition to emission values in mg/Nm3 flue gas in the bubble.

At the same time, it enables the operator to:\n\nchoose the most cost-effective place to reduce emissions\nrespond to opportunities in the crude oil market and the supply & demand situation for oil products\noperate effectively in a competitive environment. \n\nThe environmental justification is that the authority should be allowed to define emission conditions in line with its environmental targets while allowing the refinery operator flexibility in the operation of its processing units and in the selection of the various technical and economic options to fulfil the energy requirements of the refinery in competitive market conditions. Moreover, it allows easy comparison of the emission performance of a refinery and between refineries. \n\nDefinition and applicability\nFor the application of the bubble concept, the associated emission levels need to be given in a transparent way. This includes:\n1. the pollutants involved\n2. the approach used to define the bubble (concentration bubble and load bubble). (See below)\n3. a comprehensive list of installations included in the bubble concept (see below)\n4. the corresponding flue gas volumes and their measurement conditions (e.g. under standard conditions, dry)\n5. reference data (oxygen content and averaging time (daily, monthly, yearly, 3-yearly)) (see below)\n\nFollows explanations of the above points:\n\nSelf-explanatory (See Description in this Section)\n\nDifferent approaches (point 2 above) can be used to define the bubble, i.e: \nin a concentration units of the flue gas emitted by the refinery, whereby the complexity of the refinery is reflected in the energy consumption of the refinery, or\nin a annual load per tonne of crude oil processed which can be combined with the complexity factor (Nelson index) of the refinery\n\nThe load bubble includes energy efficiency of a refinery and the concentration approach does not. This is the major advantage of the load bubble. There are simplified factors (See Table 3.2) for switching between the two approaches. It should be notised that such a factor calculated on an average European energy consumption value could, however, be misleading because energy efficiencies in European refineries vary greatly (See Section 3.10.1). The conversion between the two approaches in each specific refinery is more accurate.\n\nOther methods may be used. It is more a question of convenience and custom than of principle how and in which units of measurement the bubble is defined, as long as it is clear which approach is used, which methodology is used to define the unit of measurement and which units are included. \n\nThere are different interpretations in various countries of the units to be considered (e.g. combustion only, including or excluding Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) and/or Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and/or flares). As an example, a Member State has reported that for an existing EU+ refinery the bubble concentration increases by 20% when flares are included in the bubble. Another example was given by Concawe were the calculated average of the SO2 fuel bubble was 1000 whereas the average was 1600 if all installations are included within the bubble.\n\nSelf-explanatory\n\nWhen the short averaging time is defined (e.g. daily, monthly), additional flexibility for outages, changes of feedstock and other technical problems may be granted by allowing the high values in the current period to be corrected by lower values in the next period, when the technical problems have been sorted out. The mass bubble limit (g/tonne crude oil processed) is typically defined over a long period (e.g. one year). In one EU+ refinery, a period of three years is applied. Also, it has been recognised by the Technical Working Group (TWG) that the averaging time may depend on the pollutant. (e.g. environmental and health effects of NOx and SOx are different). The averaging period is also related to the stringency of the bubble emission level (the more stringent the levels, the longer the averaging period, to allow flexibility).\n\nThe above paragraphs imply that a large amount of data is needed to continuously calculate the bubble value. For example, for SO2:\nRefinery Fuel Gas (RFG) sulphur contents need to be continually measured (e.g. by mass spectrometer) and hourly values produced; SO2 is then calculated by recording hourly fuel flows to furnaces and boilers.\nFuel oil S content is measured daily.\nFluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) figures are estimated based on a percentage of the S feed to the unit (the daily flow of feed to the unit; the S content is measured after any change of crude slate). This needs months of data collection to establish a relationship.\nSRUs, calciners etc all have different algorithms to estimate releases continously based on data collection.\nData are also needed to continuously estimate moisture and O2 content in the flue gases to correct to the reference conditions.\n\nThe last paragraph indicates the scope for considerable variability in the way refiners calculate the bubble and thus in the accuracy and reliability of the data when comparing bubble values. However when a good sample schedule is establish together with an approved calculation method, the follow up of the emissions become very easy. \n\nEnvironmental concerns\nAs in some situations refineries are physically or logistically connected to a nearby chemical plant, there may be a temptation to extend the bubble to the \"non-refinery\" processes which then may create misuse of the bubble concept because of dilution effects. These dilution effects can occur due to the high volumes of flue gases generated by some non-refinery processes that typically contain low levels of SO2 and NOx. An example of such dilution was submitted by a Member State where a refinery bubble profits from a large chemical plant and the bubble concentration is reduced by 50% (included in the LVOC BREF). Dilution effects do not affect the load approach.\n\nA second concern may be that the concentration bubble is defined as a relative standard, directly related to the fuel use in the refinery, and therefore not enhancing efficient use of energy in the refinery. This can be addressed by defining the bubble according to a load per tonne of crude oil processed or by defining an absolute ceiling (in tonnes/year), in addition to emission values in mg/Nm3 flue gas in the bubble. However, there is a possible trade-off between the stringency of the environmental requirements and the need for flexibility in the operation of a refinery. Special care should be taken not to introduce additional complexity into the regulatory system, thereby losing part of the attractiveness of the bubble concept. For example, in a MS a 3-year average is chosen for the SO2 bubble (load) for the refinery. In the case of NOx, however, the differences in long-term environmental and health effects of SO2 and NOx need to be borne in mind.\n\nAnother possible environmental concern with this concept, is the possibility of high emissions at the lower stacks (e.g. Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU)). This can easily be redressed by requiring that the flue gases of the cleaner fuels be discharged at the lower stacks and the high stacks are used to avoid high concentrations of pollutants at ground level, affecting workers and the neighbourhood. Of course, the regulator should be aware that traditional measures used to ensure that ground level concentrations of hazardous pollutants are within Air Quality Standards are still required when using the bubble concept. This comment can be extended to all legislation, because the use of the bubble concept as a regulatory tool does not prevent other existing/new limit values for specific units/facilities within the refinery for being applied.\n\nEstablishing associated emission values in the bubble concept\nIf the bubble concept is to be used as an instrument to enforce the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the refinery, then the emission values defined in the refinery bubble should be such that they indeed reflect Best Available Techniques (BAT) performance for the refinery as a whole. The most important notion is then to: \nidentify the total fuel use of the refinery;\nassess the contribution of each of the fuels to the total fuel consumption of the refinery;\nquantify the emissions from process units implicated in such emissions (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC), Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU));\nreview the applicability of Best Available Techniques (BAT) to each of these fuels and/or the process units \ncombine this information with the technical and economical constraints in using these techniques.\n\nThis may imply different emission values associated with the use of Best Available Techniques (BAT), depending on the type of fuels used and their contribution to the total refinery fuel use, together with emissions of process units such as the Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) and the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) and their contribution to the total refinery emissions. \n\nAssociated emission values in the case of a gas-fired refinery will be inherently lower than the emissions in a situation where a major part of the fuel use of the refinery is provided by liquid fuels. In this latter case Best Available Techniques (BAT) may be defined by assessing the emissions associated with the gaseous fuels used in combination with the emissions associated with using liquid residual fuels and flue gas treatment, or using clean liquid fuels, i.e. gas oil with limited S-content. If deemed necessary, these emission values for a bubble based on concentrations can easily be translated into a yearly or monthly load bubble, i.e. tonne of SO2 and/or NOx per million tonnes of crude oil processed.\n\nIn Annex V, several examples show how, emission values for the bubble concept can be defined which reflect the SO2 and NOx performance that is technically feasible for the refinery as a whole. The assessment of Best Available Techniques (BAT)-associated emission values involves however also an economic and an environmental assessment of these values. The investment decision to convert an existing refinery into a full conversion, gas-fired refinery involves much more technical, economic and environmental considerations than only the SO2 and NOx emissions from the refinery itself. Similarly, the decision to invest in flue gas desulphurisation and/or NOx abatement via Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) may also involve the concentration of liquid fuel firing of the refinery in one or two larger combustion plants, which will have major implications on the way the refinery will be able to respond to commercial pressures. The same holds true for the other technical options that a refinery will be faced with. However, maximum flexibility will be high on the agenda in assessing the various technical considerations open to the refinery. By defining emission values in the bubble that respect this need for operational flexibility, the permitting authority can support the proper environmental outcome of the investment decision process by the refinery\n\nThe bubble concept is an environmental regulatory instrument that may be used to enforce the application of Best Available Techniques (BAT) in the refinery without becoming entangled in the complex technical-economic interrelationships in the refinery. As mentioned before, there is a link to the Best Available Techniques (BAT) concept provided that the bubble is set at a level that reflects Best Available Techniques (BAT) performance of the refinery as a whole. \n\n\nExamples\nTechnical Working Group (TWG) has provided some reference numbers when bubble concept is applied to refineries. Data has been divided in two groups. One group represents actual performance of refineries and the second one represents proposals provided by different Technical Working Group (TWG) member(s).\n\n\n\n\nData on legislation applying bubble concept in some countries are provided in Annex I.\n\nReference literature\nAustria, Belgium, Concawe, France, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, UK, [248, Ademe, 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3919591_abstract", "x": 0.60626274, "y": 0.18670404, "title": "METHODS FOR RENEWABLE FUEL", "year": 2021, "text": "The present application generally relates to the introduction of a renewable fuel oil as a feedstock into refinery systems or field upgrading equipment.

By means of bacteria nearly all dissolved hydrocarbons and other organics are removed. In case deep nitrogen removal is required, denitrification in a biotreater is an option. Oxygen using (aerobic) bacteria is able to convert ammonia into nitrate and in a so-called anoxic stage (without aeration) in the biotreater other bacteria are able to convert nitrate into atmospheric nitrogen, which escape as bubbles. The generated biomass or biosludge is allowed to settle in a clarifier and for the main part recycled to the biotreater. Primary sludge from the flocculation-unit and excess biosludge are usually sent to a thickener prior to dewatering and disposal (Figure   4 .63). Air Flocculation Flotation processes can be operated with Dissolved or Induced Air (DAF or IAF resp.).\n\nOther techniques to consider are:\nheterotroph denitrification combined with autotrophic sulphide oxidation (the reductive potential of sulphide is used to eliminate nitrogen via denitrifiction, simultaneously sulphide oxidised, so that sulphide precipitation in subsequent biological treatment unit is unnecesary)\ngranular activated carbon (Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)). Pollutants are adsorbed and biologically treated in an oxygen rich atmosphere. (attainable COD: <100 mg/l)\npowdered activated carbon (Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)). Similar to Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)\ncover of the waste water treatment plant. Fixed covers are to be avoided for loss prevention purposes (building up of explosive vapours)\nemissions to air of Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) (including benzene) and odorous components (hydrogen sulphides and mercaptans), are not uncommon and cannot always be controlled fully by up-stream measures. Therefore sometimes the aeration basins of biotreaters can be provided with covers as an emission reduction measure, sometimes with off-gas treatment (biofilter or re-injected into the aeration basin). Safety aspects (explosiveness of Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC)-air mixtures) are to be attended, however they are less dangerous than in up-stream units.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA biotreater can remove 80  90 % of dissolved oil and COD as well as 90  98 % BOD under normal operating conditions. Natural nitrogen removal is normally about 10 % in an activated sludge unit (Activated Sludge Unit (ASU)), 70  80 % in a nitrification/denitrification biotreater (DNB) and up to 90 % in a tertiary (add-on) denitrification unit. For MAH/phenol >95 % removal can be achieved based on a well-adapted biological system. Oxygen aireation in activated sludge plants can be up to 50 % more efficient than air aeration techniques. \n\nCross-media effects\nEnergy consumption, activated carbon wastes when Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) or Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) are appplied and methanol consumption when denitrification is applied. Waste water treatment generate sludge. If waste water treatment is not properly operated the amount of sludge can be increased.\n\nOperational data\nIf a denitrification biotreater is applied pumping energy is relatively high. If a tertiary treatment unit is used for ammonia removal by biological nitrification, methanol can be used as in a subsequent denitrification stage as an oxygen receptor for denitrifiying bacteria. In some refinery biotreaters powdered activated carbon is dosed for meeting discharge specs.

By means of bacteria nearly all dissolved hydrocarbons and other organics are removed. In case deep nitrogen removal is required, denitrification in a biotreater is an option. Oxygen using (aerobic) bacteria is able to convert ammonia into nitrate and in a so-called anoxic stage (without aeration) in the biotreater other bacteria are able to convert nitrate into atmospheric nitrogen, which escape as bubbles. The generated biomass or biosludge is allowed to settle in a clarifier and for the main part recycled to the biotreater. Primary sludge from the flocculation-unit and excess biosludge are usually sent to a thickener prior to dewatering and disposal (Figure   4 .63). Air Flocculation Flotation processes can be operated with Dissolved or Induced Air (DAF or IAF resp.).\n\nOther techniques to consider are:\nheterotroph denitrification combined with autotrophic sulphide oxidation (the reductive potential of sulphide is used to eliminate nitrogen via denitrifiction, simultaneously sulphide oxidised, so that sulphide precipitation in subsequent biological treatment unit is unnecesary)\ngranular activated carbon (Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)). Pollutants are adsorbed and biologically treated in an oxygen rich atmosphere. (attainable COD: <100 mg/l)\npowdered activated carbon (Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)). Similar to Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)\ncover of the waste water treatment plant. Fixed covers are to be avoided for loss prevention purposes (building up of explosive vapours)\nemissions to air of Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) (including benzene) and odorous components (hydrogen sulphides and mercaptans), are not uncommon and cannot always be controlled fully by up-stream measures. Therefore sometimes the aeration basins of biotreaters can be provided with covers as an emission reduction measure, sometimes with off-gas treatment (biofilter or re-injected into the aeration basin). Safety aspects (explosiveness of Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC)-air mixtures) are to be attended, however they are less dangerous than in up-stream units.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA biotreater can remove 80  90 % of dissolved oil and COD as well as 90  98 % BOD under normal operating conditions. Natural nitrogen removal is normally about 10 % in an activated sludge unit (Activated Sludge Unit (ASU)), 70  80 % in a nitrification/denitrification biotreater (DNB) and up to 90 % in a tertiary (add-on) denitrification unit. For MAH/phenol >95 % removal can be achieved based on a well-adapted biological system. Oxygen aireation in activated sludge plants can be up to 50 % more efficient than air aeration techniques. \n\nCross-media effects\nEnergy consumption, activated carbon wastes when Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) or Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) are appplied and methanol consumption when denitrification is applied. Waste water treatment generate sludge. If waste water treatment is not properly operated the amount of sludge can be increased.\n\nOperational data\nIf a denitrification biotreater is applied pumping energy is relatively high. If a tertiary treatment unit is used for ammonia removal by biological nitrification, methanol can be used as in a subsequent denitrification stage as an oxygen receptor for denitrifiying bacteria. In some refinery biotreaters powdered activated carbon is dosed for meeting discharge specs.

The Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) market is dominated by the so-called wet lime/limestone process followed by spray dry scrubbers, and the application of sorbent injection and regenerable processes.

The process often involves an alkaline sorbent which captures SO2 and transforms it to a solid product. SO2 in refinery waste gases may have unabated concentration levels of 1500 - 7500 mg/m3. Various Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) methods exist with varying SO2 removal efficiencies. The Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) market is dominated by the so-called wet lime/limestone process followed by spray dry scrubbers, and the application of sorbent injection and regenerable processes. More information can be found in the Waste gas waste water BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001].\n\nSystems either of the regenerable or the non-regenerable type, do exist for SOx removal only, but also for simultaneous removal of dust and NOx.

Sulphates give rise to the fouling and corrosion of downstream equipment. Storage of gaseous ammonia has a great hazardous potential. Therefore a liquid solution of ammonia (25 %) is preferred. The use of urea causes higher emissions of CO and N2O and can cause high-temperature corrossion.\n\nOperational data\nMore information can be found in 4.23.3.2.\n\nApplicability\nSelective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) requires temperatures above 650 oC.

In that BREF the techniques used for the recovery of metals from secondary materials (e.g. refinery catalysts) is extensivelly treated.\n\nThe use of catalytic processes in refineries has increased significantly in the last 20 years. This increase is mainly due to the introduction of catalytic residue conversion processes such as heavy oil residue cracking, hydrocracking and residue hydroconversion, hydrodemetallisation and hydrofinishing and also Hydrogen production. Since 1980 a significant expansion has taken place of the hydrotreating and hydrodesulphurisation capacity as well as of sulphur recovery units and associated tail gas treatment, which processes also utilise catalysts. Traditional catalytic processes such as fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming and isomerisation are also generators of spent catalysts.  \n\nDescription\nThe purpose of spent catalyst management is to minimise environmental and health impacts. To achieve this goal spent catalysts are carefully handled, safely removed, carefully packed and sent for reactivation or metal reclamation. Metal recovery aims at conversion of spent catalysts into useful products, which can be recycled and re-used with minimum impact on the environment.\n\nThe principle of spent catalyst management is a scheduled, strictly regulated and safe handling of the materials involved, usually executed by specialised contractors during plant turn-arounds. Arrangements with the supplier of fresh catalyst can sometimes be made for them to take back the spent catalyst.\n\nRegeneration of hydroprocessing catalysts is usually possible 3 or 4 times. The ultimate spent catalysts are almost exclusively reworked by third parties into commercial metal oxides or metal salt solutions. Although a regeneration process has been developed for spent Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) catalysts, this process is hardly used due to the availability of cheaper alternatives. The catalyst carrier (alumina and/or silica) can sometimes be converted into products or is disposed of otherwise. Some refineries practise storage of spent catalysts at the refinery site with permission of the authorities. Spent catalysts are distinguished by type, process, composition and recyclability. A summary is given in Table   3 .97.\n\nCo/Mo catalysts from hydrodesulphurisation, hydrocracking, hydrotreating. Extensive regeneration and reclamation options are available.\n\nNi/Mo catalysts are typically used in hydrotreaters and hydrocracking units. Regeneration and reclamation capacity is available.\n\nNi/W catalysts are used in lube oil hydrofinishing. This category experiences limitations to dispose off in view of the high Tungsten content (24 % w/w). \n\nFluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) spent catalysts, also including heavy oil and residue cracking spent catalysts (Residue Catalytic Cracking (RCC)), are the largest catalyst waste category in refineries. Outlets in road building are becoming available.\n\nReformer and Isomerisation catalysts are exclusively reprocessed by the suppliers of the fresh catalysts. Replacement contracts have been concluded since the introduction of these processes due to the very expensive noble Pt metal involved. \n\nHydrodemetallisation catalysts typically have high vanadium contents (10  20 %) and are currently alumina based (used to be silica). Direct disposal to the steel industry is possibly the most cost-effective option.\n\nZn containing beds from H2 plants are typically recycled to the Zn-industry where ZnS ores are processed. Amounts are some 50 t/yr.\n\nThe applied regeneration processes are based on pyrometallurgical techniques (roasting-, calcination, smelting-, sintering- and reduction furnaces) for thermal destruction of the inorganic matrix and on hydrometallurgical methods (aqueous/acid extraction, crystallisation, precipitation, separation and drying) for recovery/purification of metal salts either in dry form or as liquid metal concentrates. \n\nThe reclamation plants (more information in Non-Ferrous BREF) are typically operated in batch mode and contain many different unit operations. From the total spent catalysts only some 5 % pure products are produced. The remainder is either ferro-alloy feed or ceramic raw material. The plant usually processes relatively small batches. Spent hydroprocessing catalysts can vary considerably in composition. Hence the plants have limited process automation. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRecover of metals from catalyst\n\nCross-media effects\nThe management of spent catalysts is an area of environmental concern because prolonged uncontrolled storage may lead to soil and groundwater contamination with heavy metals.\n\nIf the refinery has taken proper catalyst management measures the environmental concerns focus usually on the spent catalyst regeneration facilities. Most of these plants currently operate with proper flue gas and effluent treatment facilities and comply with present day emission standards. This is an important requirement for being acceptable for oil companies to make use of these spent catalyst reclamation contractors. Covering spent catalyst reception facilities is operational or being considered.\n\n\n\nOperational data\nSafe handling of chemicals is an important issue for spent catalyst metal reclaimers as toxic and pyrophoric materials are being handled. For the refinery utilisation of energy and process materials during spent catalyst handling are not particularly relevant. \n\nEconomics\nCost for processing and metal recovery depend strongly on the composition of the spent catalyst concerned. For high metal waste even a recovery fee will be paid to the waste generator. Current processing costs for an average HDS catalyst could be in the order of EUR 500/tonne. Recent stringent internationally accepted legal procedures, amongst which special packaging (for rent 2 m3 containers at EUR 5/day), labelling and acceptance requirements as well as transportation costs could add considerably to these costs. On-site processing of spent catalysts is not economic for a refinery.\n\nSpent Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) catalysts with limited V/Ni concentrations are accepted with consent of authorities, by raw material suppliers to the road building industry. The material is sometimes used in cement and as asphalt filler. \n\nExample plants\nThe regeneration of spent catalysts started in the early 1980s. All processors use pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes with varying degrees of sophistication, recovery capabilities and environmental performance. The pyro- and hydrometallurgical processes currently applied are considered acceptable and proven technology.\n\nReference literature\n[118, VROM, 1999; 122, REPSOL, 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3073082_abstract", "x": 0.7017677, "y": 0.21201497, "title": "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR MONITOING THE HEALTH OF A SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION CATALYST", "year": 2016, "text": "A system includes a controller (24) programmed to monitor an NH3 storage state of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst (14).

The ammonia vapour is mixed with the flue gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300  500 degC, traditional base metals employed between 200  400 degC, for low temperature applications 150  300 degC metals and activated carbon are used. More information about this technique can be found in the Waste gas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIt is especially suitable for situations where emission standards are strict. With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) removal efficiencies of 80 to 95 % can be obtained. Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.

The ammonia vapour is mixed with the flue gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300  500 degC, traditional base metals employed between 200  400 degC, for low temperature applications 150  300 degC metals and activated carbon are used. More information about this technique can be found in the Waste gas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIt is especially suitable for situations where emission standards are strict. With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) removal efficiencies of 80 to 95 % can be obtained. Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker).

As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker). The investment costs of new Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system depend largely on the flue gas volume, its sulphur and dust content and the retrofit complexity. The total erection costs for an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (including all material costs - i.e. reactor system + first catalyst charge, NH3 dosage & storage, piping & instrumentation -, engineering and construction costs) for a flue gas flow of 100000 Nm3 are EUR 1  3 million for gas firing and between EUR 3 - 6 million for liquid fuel firing. For existing installations the possible location of the catalyst bed is often constrained by space limitations, which will lead to additional retrofit costs.\n\nOperation costs comprise costs of energy, NH3 and catalyst replacement. Specific costs for NH3 and the catalyst charge are of the order of EUR 250 per tonne NH3 respectively EUR 1 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing gas and EUR 1.5 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing oil.\n\n\n\nThe following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) under different conditions\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOx emissions\n\nExample plants\nIt has been applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) off-gases, gas turbines, process boilers, process heaters. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied successfully on a large variety of applications: coal and oil fired power plants, waste incineration plants, diesel and gas engines, gas turbine plants, steam boilers and refinery furnaces (such us naphtha reformers, steam reformers, crude and vacuum distillations units, thermal cracking and hydroprocessing units) and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) plants. Some examples are shown in Figure   4 .55. Less experience is available with flue gas from firing high-sulphur residual oil. \n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is used extensively on power plant in Japan, Germany, Austria and on gas turbine plant in Netherlands, California in the USA- Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are also widely used in waste incineration plants. To date, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been sucessfully applied worldwide in refinery processes as power plants and the FCCs. For example, at refineries in Japan, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applications are common. In European refineries, more than 6 applications have been found (Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden).\n\nReference literature\n[302, UBA Germany, 2000], [211, Ecker, 1999], [118, VROM, 1999], [257, Gilbert, 2000], [175, Constructors, 1998], [181, High Pressure (HP), 1998], [115, CONCAWE, 1999], [268, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2889463_abstract", "x": 0.68383914, "y": 0.19923398, "title": "HIGH PERFORMANCE SCR CATALYST SYSTEM", "year": 2015, "text": "The present invention relates to a high performance SCR catalyst system for solving problems of an SCR catalyst system to be applied for the treatment of an exhaust gas of a marine diesel engine, particularly, a turbocharged engine, wherein a catalyst module for removing SOF components is attached to the back end of an engine, and a SCR catalyst module is successively provided downstream thereof, thereby enabling effective removal of nitrogen oxides.

The ammonia vapour is mixed with the flue gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300  500 degC, traditional base metals employed between 200  400 degC, for low temperature applications 150  300 degC metals and activated carbon are used. More information about this technique can be found in the Waste gas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIt is especially suitable for situations where emission standards are strict. With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) removal efficiencies of 80 to 95 % can be obtained. Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst).

If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker). The investment costs of new Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system depend largely on the flue gas volume, its sulphur and dust content and the retrofit complexity. The total erection costs for an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (including all material costs - i.e. reactor system + first catalyst charge, NH3 dosage & storage, piping & instrumentation -, engineering and construction costs) for a flue gas flow of 100000 Nm3 are EUR 1  3 million for gas firing and between EUR 3 - 6 million for liquid fuel firing. For existing installations the possible location of the catalyst bed is often constrained by space limitations, which will lead to additional retrofit costs.\n\nOperation costs comprise costs of energy, NH3 and catalyst replacement. Specific costs for NH3 and the catalyst charge are of the order of EUR 250 per tonne NH3 respectively EUR 1 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing gas and EUR 1.5 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing oil.\n\n\n\nThe following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) under different conditions\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOx emissions\n\nExample plants\nIt has been applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) off-gases, gas turbines, process boilers, process heaters. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied successfully on a large variety of applications: coal and oil fired power plants, waste incineration plants, diesel and gas engines, gas turbine plants, steam boilers and refinery furnaces (such us naphtha reformers, steam reformers, crude and vacuum distillations units, thermal cracking and hydroprocessing units) and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) plants.

The ammonia vapour is mixed with the flue gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300  500 degC, traditional base metals employed between 200  400 degC, for low temperature applications 150  300 degC metals and activated carbon are used. More information about this technique can be found in the Waste gas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIt is especially suitable for situations where emission standards are strict. With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) removal efficiencies of 80 to 95 % can be obtained. Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction.

The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker). The investment costs of new Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system depend largely on the flue gas volume, its sulphur and dust content and the retrofit complexity. The total erection costs for an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (including all material costs - i.e. reactor system + first catalyst charge, NH3 dosage & storage, piping & instrumentation -, engineering and construction costs) for a flue gas flow of 100000 Nm3 are EUR 1  3 million for gas firing and between EUR 3 - 6 million for liquid fuel firing. For existing installations the possible location of the catalyst bed is often constrained by space limitations, which will lead to additional retrofit costs.\n\nOperation costs comprise costs of energy, NH3 and catalyst replacement. Specific costs for NH3 and the catalyst charge are of the order of EUR 250 per tonne NH3 respectively EUR 1 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing gas and EUR 1.5 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing oil.\n\n\n\nThe following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) under different conditions\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOx emissions\n\nExample plants\nIt has been applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) off-gases, gas turbines, process boilers, process heaters. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied successfully on a large variety of applications: coal and oil fired power plants, waste incineration plants, diesel and gas engines, gas turbine plants, steam boilers and refinery furnaces (such us naphtha reformers, steam reformers, crude and vacuum distillations units, thermal cracking and hydroprocessing units) and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) plants. Some examples are shown in Figure   4 .55. Less experience is available with flue gas from firing high-sulphur residual oil. \n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is used extensively on power plant in Japan, Germany, Austria and on gas turbine plant in Netherlands, California in the USA- Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are also widely used in waste incineration plants. To date, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been sucessfully applied worldwide in refinery processes as power plants and the FCCs. For example, at refineries in Japan, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applications are common.

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency.

Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker). The investment costs of new Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system depend largely on the flue gas volume, its sulphur and dust content and the retrofit complexity. The total erection costs for an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (including all material costs - i.e. reactor system + first catalyst charge, NH3 dosage & storage, piping & instrumentation -, engineering and construction costs) for a flue gas flow of 100000 Nm3 are EUR 1  3 million for gas firing and between EUR 3 - 6 million for liquid fuel firing. For existing installations the possible location of the catalyst bed is often constrained by space limitations, which will lead to additional retrofit costs.\n\nOperation costs comprise costs of energy, NH3 and catalyst replacement. Specific costs for NH3 and the catalyst charge are of the order of EUR 250 per tonne NH3 respectively EUR 1 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing gas and EUR 1.5 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing oil.\n\n\n\nThe following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) under different conditions\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOx emissions\n\nExample plants\nIt has been applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) off-gases, gas turbines, process boilers, process heaters. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied successfully on a large variety of applications: coal and oil fired power plants, waste incineration plants, diesel and gas engines, gas turbine plants, steam boilers and refinery furnaces (such us naphtha reformers, steam reformers, crude and vacuum distillations units, thermal cracking and hydroprocessing units) and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) plants. Some examples are shown in Figure   4 .55. Less experience is available with flue gas from firing high-sulphur residual oil. \n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is used extensively on power plant in Japan, Germany, Austria and on gas turbine plant in Netherlands, California in the USA- Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are also widely used in waste incineration plants. To date, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been sucessfully applied worldwide in refinery processes as power plants and the FCCs.

Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300  500 degC, traditional base metals employed between 200  400 degC, for low temperature applications 150  300 degC metals and activated carbon are used. More information about this technique can be found in the Waste gas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIt is especially suitable for situations where emission standards are strict. With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) removal efficiencies of 80 to 95 % can be obtained. Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker). The investment costs of new Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system depend largely on the flue gas volume, its sulphur and dust content and the retrofit complexity. The total erection costs for an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (including all material costs - i.e. reactor system + first catalyst charge, NH3 dosage & storage, piping & instrumentation -, engineering and construction costs) for a flue gas flow of 100000 Nm3 are EUR 1  3 million for gas firing and between EUR 3 - 6 million for liquid fuel firing. For existing installations the possible location of the catalyst bed is often constrained by space limitations, which will lead to additional retrofit costs.\n\nOperation costs comprise costs of energy, NH3 and catalyst replacement. Specific costs for NH3 and the catalyst charge are of the order of EUR 250 per tonne NH3 respectively EUR 1 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing gas and EUR 1.5 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing oil.\n\n\n\nThe following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) under different conditions\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOx emissions\n\nExample plants\nIt has been applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) off-gases, gas turbines, process boilers, process heaters.

The ammonia vapour is mixed with the flue gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300  500 degC, traditional base metals employed between 200  400 degC, for low temperature applications 150  300 degC metals and activated carbon are used. More information about this technique can be found in the Waste gas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIt is especially suitable for situations where emission standards are strict. With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) removal efficiencies of 80 to 95 % can be obtained. Residual NOx stack levels of 10  20 mg/Nm3 can be obtained by application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas fired boilers and furnaces. When firing heavy residues emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 (3% O2, half hourly mean value, efficiencies up to 90 %) can be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has some cross-media effects as NH3 slip of less than <2 - 20 mg/Nm3 depending on the application and requirements or sulphate aerosols are controllable to very low levels. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operation at the end of its catalyst life may also entail bigger slip of NH3. This means a constraint in conversion efficiency. The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country. N2O generation can occur with some catalysts. At the end of its life, some components of the catalyst can be recycled and the other are dispose.\n\nOperational data\nThe ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The catalytic deNOx, process operates at low temperatures (250 oC to 450 oC). Operator and maintenance requirements are low for clean gas applications. More attention is required for applications where fouling substances like SO3 and soot or dust are present in the off-gas. The presence of SO3 will lead to formation of ammonium sulphates, which have a detrimental effect on the activity of the catalyst and lead to fouling of downstream heat exchangers. However sulphate deactivation can be avoided with a relevant temperature control. Reactivation of the catalyst can be executed by heating at 400degC, to counteract fouling a water washing step is generally applied. Soot has to be removed by blowing of the catalyst with steam or inert gas (e.g. nitrogen), while a 'dummy' layer can optionally be applied for extra protection of the catalyst. If the flue gas contain particulates containing metals, metal deactivation may occur. \nThe NH3 consumption is directly related to the NOx concentration in the flue gas and amounts to about 0.4 tonne NH3 per tonne of NOx removed. The amount of ammonia is normally dosify in a 10 % more than the stoquiometric needs. The catalyst has a lifetime of 4 to 7 years for oil firing, for gas firing 7 to 10 years. The pressure drop of the catalyst bed will lead to a minor amount of additional power consumption from fans in the system or loss of efficiency in case of a gasturbine application (equivalent to 0.5  1 % of the heat-input). Additional fuel in the event of reheating the flue gas is necessary, corresponding to a loss of energy efficiency of 1  2 %. Common safety precautions need to be taken when using pure NH3. To avoid elaborate safety measures (required for larger volumes of NH3) the trend is towards using aqueous NH3 or urea. The NH3 storage also varies in size allowing 1  3 week operational hold-up.\n\nWhen a so-called tail-end configuration is preferred (e.g. where the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is projected behind a wet scrubber, or at the end of a gasfired unit where the flue gas has reached a temperature of less than 150degC), it may be necessary to reheat the flue gases to have an adequate temperature for the reduction reaction. For these applications in-line burners are required. If the required temperature rise is larger than 70  100degC heat recuperation by means of a gas-to-gas heat exchanger could be cost-effective.\n\nApplicability\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) has been applied to combustion flue gases or process off-gases (e.g. Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)). The introduction of an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system into an existing installation is a challenge due to space, pressure and temperature problems. Creative solutions can often be found to reduce the retrofit costs. Higher operating temperatures reduce the catalyst size and costs but introduce retrofit complexity. Lower operating temperatures increase the required catalyst volume and costs but often allow a simple retrofit. \n\nSofar, predominantly operating temperatures between 200 and 450degC prevail. These temperatures are normally available before the economiser section or the air preheater of a boiler. Gas fired refinery furnaces generally have a stack temperature of 150 - 300degC. Dependent on the flue gas sulphur content a medium (MT) or low temperature (Low Temperature (LT)) catalysts can be applied in tail-end configuration. Zeolite type catalysts have reached the market place. In the USA a number of gas turbines have been fitted with these catalysts, some other applications also exist (the DESONOX process, a combined technique for SO2 and NOx removal, has such catalyst). As for oil firing, only MT catalysts can be applied, because of the presence of sulphur and particulates. MT catalysts have been widely applied in coal fired power plants predominantly at conditions where the flue gas still contain all the fly-ash and SO2 from the boiler. Two other configurations are low dust / high SO2 level and low dust / low SO2 level (tail-end configuration). There is little experience with the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) for units applying vacuum residue as fuel. However, the power plant of the refinery Mider in Germany uses vacuum residue, visbreaker residue and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-slurry as fuel in its three oil-fired heaters. A Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-plant in high dust configuration is installed after the heaters, cleaning the gas of NOx to concentration less than 150 mg/Nm3. The particular difference oil firing represent, lies in the nature of its fly ash. In contrast to coal, the fly ash is extremely fine (> 90 % fall in the category of PM2.5), though the quantity is much less. The composition is also quite different. Coal fly ash predominantly consists of silica compounds, with a minimum of unburnt HCs. Oil fly ash contains metal oxides, soot and coke. Unabated fly-ash concentrations for oil firing are in the range of 100 - 600 mg/Nm3 (with highest values for vacuum residues). Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied under these conditions may suffer from clogging by fly ash and sulphates (at coal firing the fly ash by its sandblasting effect keeps the catalyst clean). The potential for sulphate precipitation is generally higher with vacuum residue, due to its high sulphur content (2.5 - 4 %).\n\nPressure drop can be an important consideration as to whether Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) can be applied to a flue gas system.  For this reason natural draft furnaces could probably not be fitted with it.\n\nSee Section 4.23.8 for combined flue gas desulphurisation and deNOxing.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.55:\tSome examples of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) retrofit situations in refineries (clean gas situations)\n\n\nEconomics\nSee applications in each Section (Energy, catcracker and coker). The investment costs of new Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)-system depend largely on the flue gas volume, its sulphur and dust content and the retrofit complexity. The total erection costs for an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system (including all material costs - i.e. reactor system + first catalyst charge, NH3 dosage & storage, piping & instrumentation -, engineering and construction costs) for a flue gas flow of 100000 Nm3 are EUR 1  3 million for gas firing and between EUR 3 - 6 million for liquid fuel firing. For existing installations the possible location of the catalyst bed is often constrained by space limitations, which will lead to additional retrofit costs.\n\nOperation costs comprise costs of energy, NH3 and catalyst replacement. Specific costs for NH3 and the catalyst charge are of the order of EUR 250 per tonne NH3 respectively EUR 1 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing gas and EUR 1.5 per Nm3 of flue gas when firing oil.\n\n\n\nThe following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) under different conditions\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOx emissions\n\nExample plants\nIt has been applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) off-gases, gas turbines, process boilers, process heaters. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied successfully on a large variety of applications: coal and oil fired power plants, waste incineration plants, diesel and gas engines, gas turbine plants, steam boilers and refinery furnaces (such us naphtha reformers, steam reformers, crude and vacuum distillations units, thermal cracking and hydroprocessing units) and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) plants. Some examples are shown in Figure   4 .55. Less experience is available with flue gas from firing high-sulphur residual oil. \n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is used extensively on power plant in Japan, Germany, Austria and on gas turbine plant in Netherlands, California in the USA- Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are also widely used in waste incineration plants.

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied successfully on a large variety of applications: coal and oil fired power plants, waste incineration plants, diesel and gas engines, gas turbine plants, steam boilers and refinery furnaces (such us naphtha reformers, steam reformers, crude and vacuum distillations units, thermal cracking and hydroprocessing units) and Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) plants. Some examples are shown in Figure   4 .55. Less experience is available with flue gas from firing high-sulphur residual oil. \n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is used extensively on power plant in Japan, Germany, Austria and on gas turbine plant in Netherlands, California in the USA- Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) are also widely used in waste incineration plants. To date, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been sucessfully applied worldwide in refinery processes as power plants and the FCCs. For example, at refineries in Japan, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applications are common.

This increase of the use of gas is typically accompanied with a balance and control of the Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) system between suitable pressure limits to give the system flexibility, with make-up available from clean fuels such as Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) or imported gas. In those cases, an state-of-the-art controls to optimise the performance of the Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) is necessary. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA full switch to a 100% gas-fired refinery would reduce SO2 emissions by up to 99 %, CO2 by 30  38 % and NOx by 30 - >50 %. Releases of heavy metals would also be slashed. Furthermore, the use of gas generates very little dust and very low SO2 emissions, as the refinery gases are usually cleaned in amine scrubbers (see next section). Sulphur emissions are significantly lower when clean refinery fuel gas is used instead of a distillate such as automotive gasoil, i.e. 10  20 times better than low-sulphur (1 %) conventional fuel oil. Because of the low SO2 concentrations in the flue gases of gas fired boilers, the emission temperatures at the stack can be lowered to 150 degC (dew point corrosion is less of or no longer a constraint). The lower flue gas temperature represents a difference in energy efficiency and inherent CO2 emission reduction. Gaseous fuels typically release less NOx per unit of energy compared to liquid fuels, especially liquid refinery fuels. For gaseous fuels usually only thermal NOx is relevant. Oil burning normally leads to higher levels of NOx releases for several reasons, especially the problem of fuel NOx arising from the nitrogen content, the need to balance NOx and particulate releases and the frequent design requirement for firing in combination with gas. More detailed information for achievable emission values can be found in Table   4 .112 to Table   4 .118.\n\nAs a matter of summary the benefits for a switch to 100% gas-fired refinery are:\nSO2 emissions will be reduced to nil for the single unit and for the refinery bubble will be given by the emissions from other sources (very small from refinery gas, from the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU), from the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU), the flare etc)\nparticulate emissions including heavy metals will be reduced \nNOx will be reduced to the levels typical for natural gas firing for energy production techniques, and consequently other sources as catcrackers will become predominant emitters in the refinery\nCO2 emission reduction is achieved mainly because of the lower carbon content of gas, its higher calorific value and in addition because of a higher attainable efficiency (Stack gases can be cooled further).\n\nCross-media effects\nIt is acknowledged that the residual fuel replaced by gas results in a further surplus of residue, which has to be considered in any integrated solution for the fuel system of a refinery. It can be the case that those residual fuels can be burned unproperly outside, so emissions produced by that can be seen as an emission shift to outside the refinery. Furthermore, the conversion of heavy fractions into light products and the targets for lower sulphur specifications of fuels require considerable extra energy. This will lead to an inevitable increase in CO2 emissions. As a first approximation, NOx emissions can be magnified by the use of hydrogen and residual fuels containing fuel bound nitrogen. High-hydrogen fuels result in higher flame temperatures, which typically lead to higher NOx levels. Although not all the fuel nitrogen ends up as NOx emissions, the fuel NOx contributions can range from non-existent, as in the case of natural gas fuelled equipment, to several times the thermal NOx contribution of the equipment for refinery fuels. Refinery fuel gas may contain amines (nitrogen compounds) and other compounds. Further information on conversion techniques of heavy fractions to refinery fuel gas can be found in Section 4.10.3.5, coking sections and hycroconversion processes.\n\nOperational data\nThe move from liquid to gas fuel would require process upgrades and gas grid connections. \n\nApplicability\nSome gases are used locally, i.e. in the process of origin or an adjacent process, but most refineries operate a common Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) main into which most Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) is fed and transferred to the gas users. In a modern refinery the Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) main is carefully \"balanced\" with respect to supply and demand; necessary flexibility is obtained by control of production (i.e. reformer throughput, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) evaporation). The relationship to the refinery flare system is important and Refinery Fuel Gas (RFG) will normally include gas received from flare gas recovery. It may also release excess gas to flare if the upper limit pressure is exceeded. The application of energy conservation concepts (see Section 4.10.1) can help refineries to meet all their needs with refinery gas produced in-house.\n\nEconomics\nThe cost of switching to gas can be up to EUR 30 million per year for a 10Mt/yr refinery.\nUse of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) in lieu of fuel oil: Approximate capital cost is small (some reburnering) and the approximate operating cost per year is 120EUR per tonne of fuel (cost differential between Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and fuel oil). However, operating costs can vary significantly, depending on the season of the year and on the price of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) in the market.\nUse of natural gas in lieu of fuel oil: Approximate capital cost of installation is around GBP 4 million. The approximate operating cost per year may vary from below 50 EUR per tonne to above 100 EUR per tonne (cost differential between natural gas and fuel oil). Again, operating cost can vary significantly, depending on the season of the year and on the market.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of CO2, NOx, SO2 and particulate emissions (including metals)\n\nExample plants\nThe amount of refinery gas plus natural gas combusted by European refineries typically account from 60 to 100 % (in terms of megawatts fired). However data from some single European refineries shows that the amount of heavy fuel oil fired can approach to 60 %. \n\nReference literature\n[118, VROM, 1999], [292, HMIP UK, 2000], [317, EIPPCB, 2002], [249, BMUJF, 1999], [268, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3797613_abstract", "x": 0.7076836, "y": 0.3834138, "title": "LIQUID STORAGE TANK FOR A VAPOUR PROVISION SYSTEM", "year": 2021, "text": "A liquid storage tank of an electronic vapour provision device comprises one or more boundary walls defining an interior volume of the tank for accommodating source liquid to be vaporised in the electronic vapour provision device; and one or more baffles, each baffle protruding from an inner surface of the boundary wall into the interior volume to impede a flow of source liquid between portions of the interior volume between which the baffle is located.

As Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) emission abatement by VRUs is only one aspect of total Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) control in a refinery, this section should be considered in combination with storage, handling and integrated Refinery management. Several commercial techniques are available for the recovery of Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC). Those techniques can be divided in two large groups according to the type of separation. One group includes techniques where the separation of the Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) from the air due to pressure swing adsorption on activated carbon, absorption by lean oil washing (kerosene), selective membrane separation or condensation by cooling or compression (this is a special case because separation and re-condensation are both achieved in a single process). The other group integrates those techniques that the Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) are separated by condensation to liquid state. It includes re-absorption into the gasoline or crude oil, condensation and compression. Follows a short description of those techniques.\n\nabsorption: The vapour molecules dissolve in a suitable absorption liquid (water, lyes, glycols or mineral oil fractions such as reformate)\nadsorption: The vapour molecules adhere physically to activate sites on the surface of solid materials, like activated carbon (Activated Carbon (AC)) or zeolite\nhybrid systems.

The resulting waste is usually an easily handled solid with low leachability. Several processes exists:\n\nCementbased processes. In this process the slurried waste is mixed with cement and during the hardening process is incorporated in the rigid concrete matrices. In the same line, spent catalytic cracker unit (Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU)) catalyst may be used as an additive in cement manufacturing. When the cement is used, the catalyst component forms insoluble hydrates with the chalk present in the cement mixture, which also gives beneficial fixation of heavy metals. \nThermoplastic techniques. In general the use of thermoplastic solidification techniques is restricted to dry solid materials. \nMixing with bitumen. The processing of waste with bitumen is applied in the oil manufacturing industry as a disposal method. This process allows treatment of soils with high levels (up to 10 %) of high boiling range hydrocarbons.\n\nStabilisation - The conversion of a waste to a chemically stable form that resists leaching. This may be accomplished by a pH adjustment. Stabilisation also generally results in a solidification of some sort (monolith or dry granular solid).\n\nChemical Stabilisation. These processes are based on the reaction of lime with waste materials and water to form a chemically stable product. When compacted, the porosity to water is very low. This reduces the risk of leaching.\n\nEncapsulation - Complete coating or enclosure of a waste with a new, non-permeable substance. Two type of encapsulation techniques exists: Micro-encapsulation and macro-encapsulation. \n\nThe micro-encapsulation techniques are based on the reduction to surface-to-volume ratio of the waste by formation of monolithic, hard mass with a very low permeability. \nMacro-encapsulation is the enclosing of a relatively large quantity of waste, such as an entire waste container.

In the case of spent catalyst, most metal compounds are present as hydroxides which as such may also increase the strength and stability of the waste containing concrete. On the other hand, the presence of organic impurities may act as interfering agents to the curing of the concrete and this limits the application of this disposal route.\n\nThermoplastic techniques.

This technique is not suitable to be used for wastes, containing:\norganic chemicals (these may act as solvents)\noxidising salts (these can react with the organic material causing deterioration to the matrix material; at elevated temperatures these mixtures are extremely flammable)\ndehydrated salts (e.g. sodium sulphate easily dehydrates at temperatures required to plasticise bitumen; when the bitumen matrix is soaked in water, rehydration of the sodium sulphate can occur, and this can cause the bitumen to swell and split apart).\n\nMixing with bitumen. It is applied as a disposal method for spent Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit (FCCU) catalyst and used for the production of a filler component in road asphalt where the catalyst is present as a minor component. The catalyst particles are completely encapsulated which makes aqueous extraction unlikely. This process allows treatment of soils with high levels (up to 10 %) of high boiling range hydrocarbons. The soil is mixed with bitumen to produce a stable end-product suitable for use in road construction.\nChemical Stabilisation.

General information about this technique can be found in Waste water and wastegas BREF [312, EIPPCB, 2001]\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReductions of 40  70 % can be achieved giving values of less than 200 mg/Nm3 by the use of this technique. Higher reduction figures (up to 80 %) can only be achieved under optimal conditions.\n\nCross-media effects\nAmmonia injection produces significantly less N2O and CO emissions than other reagents. When the temperature lower it is needed to reheat-up the flue gas with the consequent use of energy. The systems also need the equipment necessary for the storage of ammonia or urea. Disadvantages are also NH3 slip (5  40 mg/Nm3) and possible side reactions (N2O). The U.S. EPA identified ammonia as the single largest precursor of fine particulate (2.5 microns in size and smaller) air pollution in the country.\n\nOperational data\nSelective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) process needs to achieve temperatures of 800 oC to 1200 oC for efficient conversion. With the injection of hydrogen along with the NH3 and carrier, optimum temperatures can be shifted to as low as 700 oC. To achieve good mixing, the small amount of reactant is injected along with a carrier gas, usually air or steam. The ammonia produced in the sour water stripping (see Section 4.24.2) can be used as denox agent. The effectiveness of this process is very temperature dependent.\n\nApplicability\nIt is typically applied to flue gases from heaters and boilers. No or very small space requirements. Space requirements are mainly restricted to NH3 storage.\n\nEconomics\nCost considerations include the initial capital costs for modifying the furnace or boiler, piping to inject the reactant, the reactant supply system and a recurring cost for ammonia or urea to react with the NOx. Cost estimates for the use of an Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) after a power plant are reported in the Section 4.10.4.6. The following table gives cost effectiveness of the use of Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) under different conditions\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of nitrogen oxide emissions\n\nExample plants\nApplied to FCCs and boilers\n\nReference literature\n[211, Ecker, 1999], [302, UBA Germany, 2000], [115, CONCAWE, 1999], [181, High Pressure (HP), 1998], [247, UBA Austria, 1998], [268, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2929936_abstract", "x": 0.6347081, "y": 0.19196995, "title": "A pseudoboehmite additive support and a process for the preparation thereof", "year": 2015, "text": "The invention relates to a CO oxidation promoter additive and a method of its preparation.

In the partial combustion mode considerable CO is present in the flue gas and it is consumed downstream of the regenerator in a CO boiler, both to recover the energy produced in a CO boiler and to meet environmental requirements. This system can be seen as two stage regeneration in comparison with the total combustion mode, where a single regeneration step is present. Another technique to consider is the modification of the design and operation of regenerator especially to avoid high temperature spots that tend to increase the NOx formation.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe use of partial combustion mode together with a CO boiler generates less CO and NOx emissions compared with full combustion. The use of a CO boiler or high-temperature regeneration technology can significantly reduce the CO emissions. CO achieved emissions are from less than 50 - 400 mg/Nm3 (3 % O2 daily average). In the CO boiler, refinery fuel gas addition is required to incinerate CO (~900 degC). The advantage of partial combustion coupled with a CO boiler is lower NOx (100 - 500 mg/Nm3 (3 % O2, daily average, standard conditions)), ammonia and hydrocarbons emissions. Emissions of SOx and particulates are not affected by this mode of operation. \n\nThe emission factors for a cracking unit with an electrostatic precipitator and a CO boiler are shown below.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.100:\tEmission factors for cracking (units in kg/1000 litres of fresh feed)\n\n\nCross-media effects\nFuel gas is needed for the incineration of CO. If fuel contains sulphur, emissions of SO2 may occur. Other benefits are greater throughputs and heat/power recovery.\n\nOperational data\nWhere a CO boiler is installed it should be carefully designed and operated to minimise CO and NOx releases. \n\nApplicability\nThis mode of combustion is fully applicable. In general it can be said that feed having a Conradson carbon figure up to 2 - 3 % can be processed in a 'standard' Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) without CO boiler as well as partial-burn Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC). A Conradson figure from 2 - 5 % would require a CO boiler and from 5 - 10 % a cat cooler would be needed. It should be noted that the above figures are only indicative and depend also on the severity of cracking.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment cost necessary to convert a Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) from total to partial combustion mode is around EUR 2.5 - 4 million. A major revamp of a Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) to change the design and/or operation is very expensive and typically is not justified only by environmental reasons.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProduction process.\n\nExample plants\nCarbon monoxide boiler is normally a standard practice in fluidised catalytic cracking units in the USA.

Gas-fired boilers generate hardly any dust and low SO2 emissions, when the refinery gases are cleaned in amine scrubbers. NOx emissions are also much lower than those of oil-fired boilers. Because of the low SO2 concentrations in the flue gases of gas fired boilers the emission temperatures at the stack can be lowered to 150 degC. The lower flue gas temperature represents a difference in energy efficiency and inherent CO2 emission reduction.\n\nTable   4 .112 to Table   4 .117 provide the achievable emission levels when primary measures are implemented in furnaces and boilers for each air pollutant. Other measures, such as low- NOx, flue gas desulphurisation and others are reviewed later in this chapter.

To be effective at containing oil pollution, these have to extend below the water table.  Monitoring wells will also be required to ensure that if oil does build up behind the barrier, it can be removed before it has a chance to escape under the barrier. A second form of barrier is a ditch also extending to below the groundwater table.  Any oil leaving the site can be observed floating on the water in the ditch and recovered.  The outer face of the ditch can be sealed with an impervious layer such as concrete, plastic, clay, steel piling etc\ngroundwater, like surface water basically flows downhill.  Therefore, groundwater can be prevented from leaving a site by lowering the level inside the site by pumping so that it is lower than the level outside.  Water will then flow into the site rather than outwards. The pumped water has obviously to be disposed of.  It may be possible to use this water for supply purposes on site.  If it is to be discharged, then monitoring will be required to ensure that it is not contaminated.  If it is, then it will have to be treated in which case, this method will be limited by the capacity of the effluent treatment system\nminimisation of underground piping. Underground piping can be a source of undetected releases to the soil and groundwater. Inspecting, repairing or replacing underground piping with surface piping can reduce or eliminate these potential sources. Retrofitting can be very expensive\nperform a risk analysis to rank in order of significance cases where accidental leak may occur (elements to consider are the product in the tanks/pipes, the age of the equipment, the nature of the soil and groundwater that would be affected).

Solids entering the sewer system (primarily soil particles) become coated with oil and are deposited as oily sludges in the API oil/water separator. Because a typical sludge has a solids content of 5 to 30 percent by weight, preventing one kg of solids from entering the sewer system can eliminate 3 to 20 kg of oily sludge. The Amoco/USAEPA study estimated that at the Yorktown facility 1000 tonnes of solids per year enter the refinery sewer system. Methods used to control solids include: using a street sweeper on paved areas, paving unpaved areas, planting ground cover on unpaved areas, re-lining sewers, cleaning solids from ditches and catch basins, and reducing heat exchanger bundle cleaning solids by using antifoulants in cooling water.\nA significant portion of refinery waste arises from oily sludges found in combined process/storm sewers. Segregation of the relatively clean rainwater runoff from the process streams can reduce the quantity of oily sludges generated. Furthermore, there is a much higher potential for recovery of oil from smaller, more concentrated process streams.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe aim of such a programme is to prevent contamination of the soil and the groundwater as well as reduce the amount of waste generated.\n\nReference literature\n[195, The world refining association, 1999], [316, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2000], [115, CONCAWE, 1999]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3000865_abstract", "x": 0.6457085, "y": 0.25938988, "title": "METHOD FOR CONVERTING THE RDF FRACTION INTO A SYNTHESIS GAS", "year": 2016, "text": "The present invention relates to a method for producing a synthesis gas from municipal solid waste (MSW) and, more particularly, from the fraction thereof called refuse-derived fuel (RDF).

Certain techniques can be applied to the calcination process to prevent emissions. Some of those considered to be beneficial are the following:\nThe kilns can be directly fuelled by coke gas or coke fines, driving off volatile matter and burning it within the kiln. \nThe hot stream of waste gas from the calcination of petroleum coke in rotary kilns contains considerable quantities of particulate, which - possibly after heat recovery from the waste gas - is separated with suitable filter devices, e.g. high efficiency multi-cyclones, bag filters and electrostatic precipitators (see also Chapter 4.7.8.2). During calcination in multiple-hearth furnaces, particulate abatement techniques are not usually used because of the comparatively low emissions in the waste gases.\nThe unburnt gases from the calcinator are burned in an incinerator, then passed through a waste heat boiler before being released to the atmosphere via a dust collection system.\nThe calcined coke discharges to rotary cooler where it is cooled by direct water injection. Off-gases from the cooler pass to gas cleaning by multi-cyclones and water scrubber. \nCollected fines from the dust abatement techniques should be conveyed to a silo with exit air filters. Collected cyclone fines may be recycled to product or may be used within the refinery or may be sold as product.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSome of the techniques mentioned above increase the heat integration of the calciner, reducing the consumption of fuel in the refinery. Others just decrease the amount of particulates emitted to the atmosphere, re-using the coke fines generated during the calcination process. The emission values for petroleum coke production plants attainable in continuous operation are presented in Table 4.13. Those values can be achieved by applying the techniques mentioned above.\n\n\n\nTable 4.108:\tEmission values for petroleum coke production plants (calcination of green coke) \n\n\nOperational data\nSome operational data of petroleum coke calciners can be found in Sections 2.7 and 3.7.\n\nApplicability\nApplied to coke produced by delayed cokers and fluid cokers.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProduction process.

In refineries a number of different types of sludges are generated at the following sources: crude and product tanks (bottoms), API separation units, flocculation and flotation units, DAF, contaminated soil. Biological sludges represent an important different category of sludges in terms of oil content and dewaterability. According to CONCAWE, in 1993, 44 % of the European refinery sludges were incinerated, 9 % was land farmed and  30 % land filled. It is foreseen that land filling and land farming of sludges will be increasingly prohibited by forthcoming EU legislation, which means that the scope for sludge prevention reduction but also for incineration at third parties will increase in the future.\n\nThe purpose of sludge treatment by dewatering, drying and/or incineration is to reduce the volume and the residual hydrocarbon content in order to save costs in subsequent processing or disposal. The principle of mechanical dewatering by decanters is based on centrifugal forces and on the density difference between water, oil and solids. The principle of the thermal treatment steps is based on a combination of evaporation by indirect heating and/or destruction of the organic constituents by thermal oxidation (incineration).\n\nDecanter centrifuges are the most widely used for dewatering both oily and for biosludges. Steam dryers are almost exclusively applied for biosludge and function often as a pretreatment step for incineration. Landfarming of sludge cakes is still being practised but is increasingly restricted in view of emissions and soil contamination risks.\n\nDecanter centrifuges are widely used in sludge dewatering and deoiling applications throughout the (refining) industry, either as fixed facilities or as a mobile service rendered by contractors. Dewatered biological and oily sludges can be further processed using drying and/or incineration techniques resulting into virtually oil free residues for which useful applications are available. \n\nOily sludge dewatering is only applied at refineries that dispose of sludge cakes outside their premises in order to reduce the volume and associated disposal cost. Disposal to cement kilns, coal fired power plants, dedicated sludge incinerators, municipal and hazardous waste incinerators are all practised. Drying is currently hardly employed by refineries due to safety risks. de-oiling/dewatering of sludges gives small volume of solid, low solvent waste, (centrifuging or filtration). De-oiling/dewatering of sludges gives small volume of solid, low solvent waste, (centrifuging or filtration).\n\nIn Figure   4 .64 a simplified process flow diagram is shown of a decanter combined with a fluidised bed incinerator (Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI)) being the most appropriate technique for sludge incineration. The feeding of sludge cake into the sand bed of the Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI) can be accomplished with a positive displacement pump. The oxygen for incineration is provided by air injection into the bed via a wind box and a perforated floor. An air ventilator enables the sand in the bed to fluidise. The burned out ash particulates leave the bed and are removed by flue gas treatment. This can consist of a waste heat boiler (Waste Heat Boiler (WHB)), an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), a scrubber section, a flue gas heater (to avoid a visible steam plume), a flue gas ventilator and a stack. The ash is transported by a chain/bucket conveyor combination or pneumatically to a hopper, and it usually requires dedusting by water spray and agglomeration in a double paddle mixer. At smaller incinerators a water quench is used to cool the flue gas from 850degC to about 150 degC prior to fabric (bag) filtration.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.64:\tSimplified process flow diagram of sludge handling and incineration\n\nOperating temperatures of the bed can be controlled at respectively 800 - 850 degC and 850 - 950 degC. The Waste Heat Boiler (WHB) operates between 250 and 450 degC, the ESP at 220 degC and the scrubber between 200 and 50 degC. In a Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI) all ash is carried over the top with the flue gas, which provides a large dust loading (typically 50000 mg/Nm3) to the Waste Heat Boiler (WHB) and ESP. Some 50 % of the dust is collected in the Waste Heat Boiler (WHB), which can be regarded as a settling chamber. The catchment efficiency of an ESP is typically 99 %, leaving the (venturi) scrubber system to eliminate  500 mg/Nm3 to the stringent CEC limit of 5 mg/Nm3. The ash might find a useful outlet in concrete or asphalt dependent on the quality.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, organic compound, PAH, heavy metals generated by those systems should be properly controlled by suitable abatement techniques.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nGeneration of sludges can be minimised and can be maintained to values between 0.1 to 0.5 kg per tonne of feedstock processed within the refinery. \n\nCross-media effects\nScrubbing might require caustic if acidic (SO2 and NOx) components are present in the flue gas in concentrations which need to be removed to legal limits. The Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI) with flue gas treatment and ash handling is a closed system, with fully automated control. The system is kept under slight negative pressure. The described system is regarded state-of-the-art for sludge incineration and is able to fulfil all legal stack emission requirements. Dioxins (PCDD/F) could be an issue at high chlorine loading combined with sub-optimum operation conditions. In flue gas treatment systems of domestic sludge incinerators impregnated activated carbon filters (Activated Carbon Filters (ACF)) or zeolites are installed for mercury/dioxin control. Effluent from the scrubber system can be substantial. Recirculation of scrubber water is only a cost effective proposition if treatment is required prior to discharge.\n\nOperational data\nSafety issues are associated with start-up and (planned or emergency) shut-down, for which a flame control interlock and a nitrogen purging system is required. Anaerobic and pyrophoric sludges (tank bottoms) can cause safety problems during storage and drying. The energy requirements of sludge drying and incineration depend strongly on the sludge cake characteristics (water and residual oil contents). Energy integration with Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI) is two fold: air preheating of the primary fluidisation air is standard, and steam generation can be economically accomplished with systems able to generate >8 tonnes of Medium Pressure (MP) steam/hour. An intrinsic disadvantage of Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI) is the relatively large excess of air utilised in order to keep the bed fluidised. \n\nApplicability\nBecause its high cost, options as reduction/recycling of waste are more typical waste minimisation options to be applied before waste incineration. Fluidised bed incinerators may be an option for third-party waste industry receiving waste streams.\n\nEconomics \nFor a Fluidised Bed Incinerator (FBI) with a capacity of 4 t/h sludge cake (20 % dry solids) a footprint of about 50x100 m is required including tankage and complete flue gas and ash handling. The installation is normally 12  15 m high (tanks, incinerator, Waste Heat Boiler (WHB), ESP, ash hopper) and the stack height is usually at least 40 m, dependent on ancillary installations. The above-described system would be suitable for a large 20 Mt/yr refinery and requires a capital investment of about EUR 37.5 million (including installation). The operational costs could amount to EUR 500  700/tonne dry solids. If large scale domestic sludge incinerators are available, which are entitled to take industrial sludges, the installation of a dedicated sludge incineration system is not economically justifiable. This certainly would be the case for smaller refineries, indicating that contract dewatering, drying and incineration are competitive to own processing.\n\nA combination of decanters with an advanced drying system for oily sludge occupies only 10  15 % of the above indicated space, and would involve a capital investment of EUR 5 million due to the fact that expensive flue gas treatment is avoided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nAt some locations it has become common in the last 5  10 years to minimise sludges, collect them in tanks or basins and recover as much as possible the oil and water phases after gravity settling. \n\nExample plants\nDecanter centrifuges are reliable, advanced and proven technology with minimum emissions. At refinery locations permanent decanter centrifuges have for example been installed at refineries in Godorf, Gothenburg and Stanlow. A few times per year contractors are hired in either for on-site sludge processing or for collection and off-site processing (decanting, drying, incineration in cement kilns, power plants or in industrial/domestic waste or dedicated sludge incinerators).\n\nSludge incineration plants using the fluidised bed system are state-of-the-art but require advanced design and process control. At several refineries Mobil, Wilhelmshafen, Shell Pernis and Godorf, Esso Botlek these systems were already built in the 1970s. Some of them have been dismantled due to the current availability of more economic options as compared with necessary investment and operation in additional flue gas cleaning equipment. For oily sludges mixing with other wastes and use as secondary fuel in cement kilns and/or power plants represents an attractive disposal route if those plants use appropriate abatement techniques. International sludge contractors employ either mobile decanter and drying systems for oil recovery (Impex, EPMS, Soil Recovery A/S) or fixed oily sludge treatment systems (ATM). \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3002257_abstract", "x": 0.5735834, "y": 0.27880028, "title": "WATER TREATMENT METHOD, AND WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM", "year": 2016, "text": "Provided are a water treatment system and a water treatment method with which salt-containing water can be recovered with a high water recovery rate.

Consequently the identification of hydrocarbon sources is the first measure to consider.\n\nNitrogen or air stripping for benzene recovery from waste water. Nitrogen stripping can be used to strip benzene and other low aromatic compounds from waste water. The mixture is treated by activated carbon beds that capture the organic allowing cleaned nitrogen to recycle to the waste water stripper.

Sources of contamination with hydrocarbons are desalters (40 %), storage tanks (20 %), slop-systems (15 %) and other processes (25 %). It is possible to recognise type and extent of water contamination directly at the source by use of electromagnetically high frequencies (EA - Energy Absorption Technology). \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA refinery has used that system to reduce 1895 l/d of waste water containing benzene 50 ppm, 100 ppm toluene/xylenes and 100 ppm of other hydrocarbons liquids. The recovery unit consistently reduced benzene to below 500 ppb. About 35000 kg of hydrocarbon liquid are returned to the refinery feedstock annually. This technique can be also applied to remove Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE)\nRecoveries greater than 99 % or raffinate concentrations well below 1ppm can be achieved. With this technique waste water containing > 1 % phenols was treated to get purified water with a phenol content lower than 1 ppm (Efficiencies: higher than 99 %; Koch Process Technology, Inc.). Phenol containing waste water may also be treated microbiologically\nThe efficiency of this process is stated to be 99 % for a COD of 30000 mg/l.

More information can be found in Section 2.10.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSyngas produced in this process has a sulphur content of 0.01  0.05 % and could be used, as refinery fuel gas for hydrogen, fuel or chemical production. Water containing the soot particulates is filtered and the filter cake is subjected to a controlled burning process. The process is in principle autothermic, the heat of combustion being sufficient to evaporate the moisture content of the filter cake. \n\nThe Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a highly integrated and efficient process which can supply power, hydrogen and steam. Furthermore, it offers in principle an acceptable outlet for heavy residues and feedstocks or even refinery sludges, provided the latter are less than 1 % of feed. Hot gas clean-up systems have the potential to increase system efficiency and lower system costs. The achieved emissions to the atmosphere from that system are: SO2 50 mg/Nm3, NOx 65 mg/Nm3 @ 3 % O2, particulate 5 mg/Nm3 and carbon monoxide 10  30 mg/Nm3.\n\nThe emissions from the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) show a significant decrease compared with conventional power/steam plants. The SO2 concentration in the refinery exhaust is reduced by 80 % but CO2 emissions increase.\n\nThe use of by-product and residual streams to meet the fuel requirement of refineries cannot only be cost-effective, but also is environmentally beneficial in that it makes use of what would otherwise be a waste refinery stream that would be flared without recovering the energy content.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn some cases, some difficulties may occur in burning low calorific value gas produced. Water effluent is normally sent to the existing waste water treatment plant of the refinery. It may contain significant amounts of metals as V, Cr or Ni and PAHs.\n \nOperational data\nUtility requirements for the gasification processes are 1800  4900 kWh/t of power and 1140 kg/t of steam consumption. The soot product is about 50  75 % w/w V2O5 residue, which can be sold to metal reclaimers. The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) complex is also equipped with all the necessary auxiliary systems, including cooling water (mixed system with an open seawater circuit for large users and a closed clean water circuit for the other users), demi-water, air, nitrogen, water and fuel gas networks, fire fighting, flare, storage, electrical distribution, buildings, etc.\n\nIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a technology with high flexibility in start-up, shutdown and part-load operation, depending on the level of integration between the different sections. Typically, systems that use heat exchange equipment are more efficient than those using quench cooling; however, the capital cost of the system with heat exchange is higher and there is a risk of fouling. Handling of the soot and filter cake should be done with care to avoid dust (even at 80 % moisture) due to the toxic properties of the residue.\n\nApplicability\nThis technique can be seen as an alternative approach to removing sulphur using feed hydrotreatment (see Section 4.10.2.3). During normal refinery operation the gasifiers of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant are able to convert almost any refinery residue (atmospheric residues, vacuum residues, visbroken or thermal tars, etc.) to heat and power.

The present invention proposes a method for combining different thermochemical processes and selecting different types of biomass or waste to obtain the highest possible H2/CO ratio suitable for further gas conversion to biomaterials (biomethane, biomethanol and other bio-CxHyOz hydrocarbons). The present invention differs in that the proposed method for the production of synthetic gas allows the thermal decomposition of different fractions of biomass at the same time, selecting different types of biomass with different H/C ratios.

More information can be found in Section 2.10.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSyngas produced in this process has a sulphur content of 0.01  0.05 % and could be used, as refinery fuel gas for hydrogen, fuel or chemical production. Water containing the soot particulates is filtered and the filter cake is subjected to a controlled burning process. The process is in principle autothermic, the heat of combustion being sufficient to evaporate the moisture content of the filter cake. \n\nThe Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a highly integrated and efficient process which can supply power, hydrogen and steam. Furthermore, it offers in principle an acceptable outlet for heavy residues and feedstocks or even refinery sludges, provided the latter are less than 1 % of feed. Hot gas clean-up systems have the potential to increase system efficiency and lower system costs. The achieved emissions to the atmosphere from that system are: SO2 50 mg/Nm3, NOx 65 mg/Nm3 @ 3 % O2, particulate 5 mg/Nm3 and carbon monoxide 10  30 mg/Nm3.\n\nThe emissions from the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) show a significant decrease compared with conventional power/steam plants. The SO2 concentration in the refinery exhaust is reduced by 80 % but CO2 emissions increase.\n\nThe use of by-product and residual streams to meet the fuel requirement of refineries cannot only be cost-effective, but also is environmentally beneficial in that it makes use of what would otherwise be a waste refinery stream that would be flared without recovering the energy content.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn some cases, some difficulties may occur in burning low calorific value gas produced. Water effluent is normally sent to the existing waste water treatment plant of the refinery. It may contain significant amounts of metals as V, Cr or Ni and PAHs.\n \nOperational data\nUtility requirements for the gasification processes are 1800  4900 kWh/t of power and 1140 kg/t of steam consumption. The soot product is about 50  75 % w/w V2O5 residue, which can be sold to metal reclaimers.

Typically, systems that use heat exchange equipment are more efficient than those using quench cooling; however, the capital cost of the system with heat exchange is higher and there is a risk of fouling. Handling of the soot and filter cake should be done with care to avoid dust (even at 80 % moisture) due to the toxic properties of the residue.\n\nApplicability\nThis technique can be seen as an alternative approach to removing sulphur using feed hydrotreatment (see Section 4.10.2.3). During normal refinery operation the gasifiers of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant are able to convert almost any refinery residue (atmospheric residues, vacuum residues, visbroken or thermal tars, etc.) to heat and power.

Water containing the soot particulates is filtered and the filter cake is subjected to a controlled burning process. The process is in principle autothermic, the heat of combustion being sufficient to evaporate the moisture content of the filter cake. \n\nThe Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a highly integrated and efficient process which can supply power, hydrogen and steam. Furthermore, it offers in principle an acceptable outlet for heavy residues and feedstocks or even refinery sludges, provided the latter are less than 1 % of feed. Hot gas clean-up systems have the potential to increase system efficiency and lower system costs. The achieved emissions to the atmosphere from that system are: SO2 50 mg/Nm3, NOx 65 mg/Nm3 @ 3 % O2, particulate 5 mg/Nm3 and carbon monoxide 10  30 mg/Nm3.\n\nThe emissions from the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) show a significant decrease compared with conventional power/steam plants. The SO2 concentration in the refinery exhaust is reduced by 80 % but CO2 emissions increase.\n\nThe use of by-product and residual streams to meet the fuel requirement of refineries cannot only be cost-effective, but also is environmentally beneficial in that it makes use of what would otherwise be a waste refinery stream that would be flared without recovering the energy content.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn some cases, some difficulties may occur in burning low calorific value gas produced. Water effluent is normally sent to the existing waste water treatment plant of the refinery. It may contain significant amounts of metals as V, Cr or Ni and PAHs.\n \nOperational data\nUtility requirements for the gasification processes are 1800  4900 kWh/t of power and 1140 kg/t of steam consumption. The soot product is about 50  75 % w/w V2O5 residue, which can be sold to metal reclaimers.

More information can be found in Section 2.10.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSyngas produced in this process has a sulphur content of 0.01  0.05 % and could be used, as refinery fuel gas for hydrogen, fuel or chemical production. Water containing the soot particulates is filtered and the filter cake is subjected to a controlled burning process. The process is in principle autothermic, the heat of combustion being sufficient to evaporate the moisture content of the filter cake. \n\nThe Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a highly integrated and efficient process which can supply power, hydrogen and steam. Furthermore, it offers in principle an acceptable outlet for heavy residues and feedstocks or even refinery sludges, provided the latter are less than 1 % of feed. Hot gas clean-up systems have the potential to increase system efficiency and lower system costs. The achieved emissions to the atmosphere from that system are: SO2 50 mg/Nm3, NOx 65 mg/Nm3 @ 3 % O2, particulate 5 mg/Nm3 and carbon monoxide 10  30 mg/Nm3.\n\nThe emissions from the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) show a significant decrease compared with conventional power/steam plants. The SO2 concentration in the refinery exhaust is reduced by 80 % but CO2 emissions increase.\n\nThe use of by-product and residual streams to meet the fuel requirement of refineries cannot only be cost-effective, but also is environmentally beneficial in that it makes use of what would otherwise be a waste refinery stream that would be flared without recovering the energy content.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn some cases, some difficulties may occur in burning low calorific value gas produced. Water effluent is normally sent to the existing waste water treatment plant of the refinery. It may contain significant amounts of metals as V, Cr or Ni and PAHs.\n \nOperational data\nUtility requirements for the gasification processes are 1800  4900 kWh/t of power and 1140 kg/t of steam consumption. The soot product is about 50  75 % w/w V2O5 residue, which can be sold to metal reclaimers. The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) complex is also equipped with all the necessary auxiliary systems, including cooling water (mixed system with an open seawater circuit for large users and a closed clean water circuit for the other users), demi-water, air, nitrogen, water and fuel gas networks, fire fighting, flare, storage, electrical distribution, buildings, etc.\n\nIntegrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a technology with high flexibility in start-up, shutdown and part-load operation, depending on the level of integration between the different sections. Typically, systems that use heat exchange equipment are more efficient than those using quench cooling; however, the capital cost of the system with heat exchange is higher and there is a risk of fouling. Handling of the soot and filter cake should be done with care to avoid dust (even at 80 % moisture) due to the toxic properties of the residue.\n\nApplicability\nThis technique can be seen as an alternative approach to removing sulphur using feed hydrotreatment (see Section 4.10.2.3). During normal refinery operation the gasifiers of the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant are able to convert almost any refinery residue (atmospheric residues, vacuum residues, visbroken or thermal tars, etc.) to heat and power.

The acid relief neutraliser is operated so as to minimise the hydrogen fluoride content of the incondensable gas stream. Emissions levels of <1mg HF/Nm3 can be achieved. The vent gas should pass to flare not to the refinery fuel gas system; a dedicated flare/stack is normally retained for this.

Consequently, storage and handling it should comply with all safety rules. \n\nKF (or NaF) is formed during the neutralisation process.

Some techniques that may be applied to prevent emission from the flexicoker are:\n\n\nThe flexicoking process has a high level of heat integration. The only source of heat in the Flexicoker process is the gasifier, where the coke is partially oxidised. The remainder of the heat in the coker gas is recovered by generating steam. The energy efficiency can be further increased if the coke gas is combusted in a gas turbine of a combined cycle unit. See Section 4.10.\nAs coke cutting from drums is not needed, emissions and dirty effluent generation are avoided compared to delayed coking. Moreover, the sulphur components from the coke gas are easy to eliminate. Some 84 - 88 % w/w of the hydrocarbon feed is recovered as hydrocarbon product, the remainder is converted into CO, CO2 and H2O.\nThe coke gas from the heater is passed through a cyclone set to remove the coarser coke particles and is subsequently cooled by generation of high-pressure steam and by preheating boiler feed water. About 75 % of coke fines which pass through the two stages of heater cyclones are recovered in tertiary cyclones. Almost all the coke fines which escape the tertiary cyclones are scrubbed out in the venturi scrubber. The water slurry from the venturi scrubber is steam stripped to remove absorbed hydrogen sulphide and ammonia.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIncreases the energy efficiency of the flexicoking process. \nGenerates less waste than delayed coking. \nPrevents particulate, hydrogen sulphide and ammonia emissions. \n\nOperational data\nSome operational data for flexicokers can be found in Sections 2.7. and 3.7.\n\nApplicability\nFully applicable.

The stage 1 directive only allows oxidation in special situations, e.g. when energy is recovered by a gas motor\nbiofiltration: Decomposition to CO2 and H2O is achieved at temperatures slightly above ambient by micro-organisms located in a solid humidified mass. \n\nVolatile Organic Carbons (VOC) collection and destruction\nAnother control technique is to collect VOCs from vents, pumps and compressors and to route them to a flare system. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThermal oxidation: 99  99.9 %, Catalytic oxidation 95  99 %, Biofilters 95  99 %. The efficiency of the biofilters is normally a controversy. Since high removal efficiencies are only reaqched with high inlet loads, emission concentrations well below 50 mg/Nm3 Non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC) are rarely achieved.\nBiotreatment: The units are rugged, silent, need minimal maintenance and no inputs. No fuel or chemicals are required. Biofilters remove and destroy aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, other Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC), H2S and odors in off-gases from process streams, tank vents, relief valves, soil vapour extracion, waste water treatments, etc.\n\nCross-media effects\nThermal oxidation can give unwanted combustion products such as NOx, requiring extra treatment. Catalytic oxidation requires less energy to arrive at combustion temperatures, and can be competitive with thermal oxidation at low inlet concentrations. Thermal oxidation requires good primary and/or secondary safety measures to prevent explosions, while the efficiency of catalytic oxidation may be reduced by catalyst poisoning and ageing. Incineration of Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) also generates CO2. Combustion of streams with low concentrations and for preheating of catalysts additional fuel is consumed.\n\nWaste is only relevant in case biofilters are exhausted. No secondary pollutants or wastes are created. \n\nOperational data\nUsually operating times are longer than two years. Biofilters: Input air should be 5  55 oC and moist. \n\nApplicability\nBiofilters: Any gas that can burn in air will oxidise in biofilters. Installation for the treatment of flows of 17 m3/h up to 135000 m3/h are found in the literature.\nBioxidation: The method is highly suited for treatment of continuous constant-composition air streams with low concentrations of organic pollutants. The method is not suitable for the direct treatment of the vapour/air mixtures often encountered in transshipments, because such mixtures have mostly higher vapour concentrations (>1 % v/v) and appear as sudden peak flows during the rather infrequent unloading operations. Biotreatment facilities are certainly sensitive to poisoning by presence of unexpected compounds in the incoming vapour stream. Consequently most of those systems needs continuous monitoring to prevent the entrance of undesired compounds.\n\nEconomics\nThermal oxidation of VOCs. The economics of a thermal oxidation system with heat recovery will depend on many factors, including the calorific value of the waste stream. If a thermal oxidiser is furnished with a gas-to-gas heat exchanger that has an efficiency of 60 % and a gas flow of 4720 l/s, the payback for heat recovery will be impressive. Assume natural gas, used as supplementary fuel, costs $20/ million of kcal and electric power cost $0.08/kWh. If a system runs 24 h/day, 350 d/yr, the payback for the 200000$ additional capital investment for a plant-type heat exchanger would be less than five months.\n\nBiofilters: Biofiltration costs significantly cost less than the other air pollution control techniques. Capital costs vary with flowrate and the destruction/removal efficiency. Capital costs start at about $15/m3/h. Operation and maintenance costs are extremely low because no fuel or chemicals are required.\n\n\nTable 4.144:\tVolatile Organic Carbons (VOC) control technique applied to refinery \nSource: UN-ECE EC AIR/WG6/1998/5\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of VOCs\n\nExample plants\nThermal incineration: More than 107 units operaring in the world and over 76 portables.\n\nReference literature\n[118, VROM, 1999], [181, High Pressure (HP), 1998]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3647280_abstract", "x": 0.52874136, "y": 0.44144076, "title": "METHOD AND APPARATUS OF CONTINUOUS INTENSIVE GLASS MELTING", "year": 2020, "text": "The invention relates to a method of continuous intensive glass melting from a batch containing raw materials of mineral and/or chemical origin, wherein the batch is continuously fed to a furnace and Joule-heated by a plurality of electrodes and a plurality of bubbling gas streams is injected into a glass melt.
