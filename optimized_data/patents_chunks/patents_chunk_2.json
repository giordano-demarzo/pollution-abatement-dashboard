The purity of EDC and HCl from external sources (in the case of non-balanced plants) are also important.\n\nDirect chlorination: A slight excess of chlorine (or ethylene) is preferred in order to ensure complete ethylene (or chlorine) conversion. \n\nThe use of high-purity chlorine will minimise the formation of brominated by-products. However, the bromine content of the feed chlorine is directly affected by the source of the salt used in its manufacture (see the CAK BREF). The formation of impurities involves the occurrence of radicals. For this reason small amounts of oxygen, often present in the chlorine produced by electrolysis, may increase the selectivity to EDC, by inhibiting the secondary reactions.\n\nOxychlorination\nPurity of HCl (fresh and recycled): In most cases, HCl from the EDC cracking section is used as a source of chlorine, and the organic content has to be controlled to prevent the formation of more highly chlorinated side products. For example, the Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) content in the recycled HCl needs to be reduced to about 100 ppm.\n\nThe acetylene content (from Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) cracking) in the recycled HCl may be critical and should be controlled (below 0.1 %), as acetylene tends to form highly chlorinated side products (such as dichloroethylenes, trichloroethylenes, tetrachloroethane and pentachloroethylene) and tars, which can lead to catalyst deactivation by coking (pore plugging) and may also influence downstream operations (trichloroethylene hinders the distillation of the light ends in order to recover EDC). Selective hydrogenation to ethylene is often used to remove acetylene from this HCl stream.

Gaseous fuels generally have a lower sulphur content than liquid fuels. For existing plants, the applicability may be restricted by the design of the burners.\n\nThe applicability may be limited by the need to take into account the overall hydrocarbon balance of the plant: Some LVOC processes produce liquid residues or by-products which are used as internally generated, non-commercial fuels because it would not be economic to recover any of the compounds they contain, e.g. lower and heavy ends from the styrene monomer / propylene oxide process and ethylene cracker residue. These streams usually have a sulphur content < 1 000 ppm so burning them as fuels creates SOX emissions. However, if these streams were not burnt as fuels they would have to be incinerated on site or off site, which would create emissions, and the plant would have to burn more conventional fuel, which would increase costs, emissions and raw material usage and decrease energy efficiency. \n\nSecondary techniques for SOX: Wet scrubbing with caustic\nSOX is removed by wet gas scrubbing using an alkaline absorbent, such as sodium hydroxide (caustic soda).

A full description of the thermal oxidation process (including regenerative thermal oxidation) is given in the CWW BREF. A summary of this description and its applicability to LVOC is given below.\n\nDescription\nThermal oxidation (often referred to as 'incineration', although the term 'incineration' should be limited to combustion of liquid and solid waste) is the oxidation of the VOC content of waste gases and/or odorants in a waste gas stream that is heated above its auto-ignition temperature in a combustion chamber for sufficient time to ensure complete combustion to carbon dioxide and water.\n\nTechnical description\nTechniques to reduce VOC emissions to air from the process under normal operating conditions include:\n\ncombustion control: controlling the oxygen concentration and the temperature profile within the oxidiser;\noxidiser design: sizing (e.g. residence time), design features (mixing);\noxidiser type: regenerative, once-through, etc.\n\nThe combustion is optimised to maximise the removal of organic compounds, while minimising emissions to air of CO and NOX.\n\nTechniques to reduce NOX emissions within the thermal oxidiser include:\n\nthe use of low-NOX burners; \nthe reduction of the need for support fuel, e.g. by using a regenerative thermal oxidiser (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO));\nthe choice of a support fuel with a low nitrogen content.\n\nOther techniques to reduce NOX emissions are:\n \nremoval of NOX precursors from the process off-gas streams: remove (if possible, for reuse) most of the NOX precursors prior to thermal treatment, e.g. by scrubbing, condensation or adsorption (see for example Section 10.4.1.1 for DNT plants);\nfinal abatement by Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) (see Section 2.4.2.1). \n\nA full description of the thermal oxidation process and the types of thermal oxidation equipment available is given in the CWW BREF.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThermal oxidation can achieve almost complete destruction of the VOC species present in the waste gas stream.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe VOC destruction rate is 98 % to > 99.9 %, with residual VOCs (expressed as Total Organic Carbon (TOC)) of 0.5-30 mg/Nm3.\n\nData for emissions of VOCs when using thermal oxidation as an abatement technique have been reported for the production of:\n\nTDI/MDI (see Section 10.4.1);\nformaldehyde (see Section 6.4.1);\nphenol (see Section 8.4.1);\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\nNOX emissions from thermal oxidation depend on the concentration of nitrogen-containing compounds in the waste gas, the flame temperature and the need for support fuel. Low NOX emissions can be achieved with regenerative thermal oxidation, especially when replacing the combustion of support fuel with electric heating (see example in Section 10.4.1).\n\nData for emissions of NOX and PCDD/F when using thermal oxidation as an abatement technique have been reported for the production of:\n\nTDI/MDI (see Section 10.4.1);\nEDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\nCross-media effects\nThermal oxidation will also generate emissions typical of combustion plants, i.e. CO and NOX. NOX emissions may require subsequent abatement..\nIn the unfavourable event that the VOC content of the waste gas stream is not sufficient to support combustion, support fuels are used. The use of a support fuel will have a negative effect on the overall energy efficiency of the process and may increase emissions to air (e.g. NOX, CO).\nAny sulphur present in the waste gas (or support fuel) will be emitted as SO2, and halogens as hydrogen halides. Further treatment of the exhaust gas may be needed to abate these emissions.\nIf the VOCs have a high chlorine content, the thermal oxidiser will need to be designed and operated to prevent and minimise the formation of dioxins and furans, e.g. by rapid cooling of the exhaust gases.\nAbatement of the exhaust gases emitted from the thermal oxidiser may produce liquid and/or solid wastes requiring further treatment or disposal.\nHeat from thermal oxidation can be used to generate steam and electricity to be used on or off site if the heat available is sufficient to justify the additional investment.\n\nMeasures to reduce the cross-media effects can be found in the Large Combustion Plants (LCP), CWW and REF BREFs. The following table is not exhaustive.\n\n\nTable 2.7:\tTechniques to reduce emissions from thermal oxidisers\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThermal oxidisers can be used to reduce emissions from almost all VOC sources, including reactor vents, distillation vents, solvent operations and operations carried out in ovens, dryers and kilns. They can handle minor fluctuations in flow and load, but large fluctuations may require the use of a flare. They are best suited to those processes with moderate to high VOC loadings where recovery of the VOCs is not possible. Low VOC loadings will result in high consumption of support fuel.\n\nThe applicability for low-NOX burners and RTOs  may be restricted by design and/or operational constraints at existing units. The applicability of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to existing units may be restricted by space availability. The applicability of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to existing units may be restricted by the residence time needed for the reaction.\n\nEconomics\nThermal oxidisers are a significant part of the site infrastructure, with associated capital and operating costs. Further information is provided in the CWW BREF.\nBoiler plants can be used for the thermal oxidation of VOCs if the temperature and residence time are in the correct range.

Formaldehyde leaks can be detected without a sophisticated monitoring system because of the strong odour (detectable at about 0.8 ppm). Fugitive emissions are monitored indirectly by tests on the workspace formaldehyde concentrations to which operators may be exposed. \n\nThe occupational exposure limits (OELs) depend on national regulations in the Member States. Limits are normally expressed as an 8-hour and/or 15-minute time-weighted average. Sometimes a maximum exposure level (Maximum Exposure Level (MEL)) is given. In 2014 in Belgium, the OEL was 0.3 ppm as an 8-hour average with a maximum of four peaks of 0.6 ppm as a 15-minute average and a maximum value of 1 ppm. Whilst the values in other countries may vary, these numbers are not unusual.\n\nFormaldehyde solutions with high concentrations solidify when spilt. Vapour emissions from spills are therefore low and the resulting solid material can be easily removed. If vapours do escape from liquid formaldehyde spills then foams can be used to reduce the loss and water can be sprayed over the vapour cloud.\n\nThe main technique to minimise fugitive emissions is a leak detection and repair (LDAR) programme (see Section 3.5.4.4 of the CWW BREF). Although it is difficult to predict the exact reductions in fugitive emissions that can be achieved by LDAR, it is reported that a quarterly inspection and maintenance programme (I/M) for pumps and valves has an overall efficiency for formaldehyde emissions of about 57 % (see Table 6.6). Monthly I/M for pumps and valves has an overall efficiency of about 69 %. The use of double sealed pumps, application of a rupture disc to relief valves, and monthly I/M for other valves has an overall efficiency of about 91 %. Double mechanical seals and rupture discs are virtually 100 % efficient in reducing emissions from pumps and relief valves .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3951549_abstract", "x": 0.7052562, "y": 0.4744238, "title": "WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD", "year": 2022, "text": "A water management method for controlling at least one operational parameter of at least one water control device, wherein the operational parameter is associated with water used by the water control device, the method comprising the steps of: determining, using a computing device, a mode of operation for the water control device based on water supply, developing control data based on determining mode of operation and the operational parameter, and sending the control data to an electronic controller of the water control device; and the electronic controller receiving the control data and controlling the operational parameter based on the received control data, and a corresponding water management system.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"12.4.1.1.3\" title=\"Condensation\">\n\n<content>\nCondensation\n\nSee the CWW BREF on condensers.\nTechnical description\nAfter oxidation, the waste gas and working solution are separated.

Concerning the production of sodium or potassium methylate or ethylate, the Regulation prohibits the use of mercury electrodes from 1 January 2028. Also, direct and indirect releases of mercury and of mercury compounds into air, water and land in terms of per tonne of substances produced have to be reduced by 50 % by 2020 as compared to 2010.

These towers are installed in parallel configuration inside the filtration sector. On the lateral sides of the filtration sector, two horizontal, bidirectional channels for feeding and discharge are installed, as depicted on Figure 4 and 5.Each modular case is filled with filter media, composed by a selected mixture of highly adsorbing materials, to maximize the performance.Each modular case is equipped, on its front and back sides, with a calibrated-pore system, in order to calibrate the entering and exiting flowrates of water and guarantee an adequate contact time between water and filtration media, thus enhancing adsorption performance and reducing headlosses (figure 2 and 5).SWID system can be managed and controlled remotely by means of a SCADA software,connected to a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) computing system, in order to monitor and control the whole treatment process at each phase, and manage emergencies and maintenance operations.A tank is located on the front side of the SWID plant for the storage of untreated water during maintenance, emergencies or exceptional contaminant spillovers. Another tank is available for the storage and settlement of the process sludge, collected during the cleaning process run at the end of each process cycle (Figure 9).When biodegradable organic pollutants (for example, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) are present in water, SWID system is integrated with a process, based on Ozone, to regenerate the filtration media through the destruction of the organic substances.CONCLUSIONSWith SWID technology, it is possible to manage and treat stormwater runoff flowing on large surface areas, and waste water, by means of highly performing plants, which are also volumetrically compacted, easily to move and without necessity of ground excavation.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"8.4.2.2.1\" title=\"Hydrolysis to decompose organic peroxides\">\n<references_to>8.3.2.1</references_to>\n\n<content>\nHydrolysis to decompose organic peroxides\n\nDescription\nIn order to reduce emissions to water of organic peroxides from the oxidation unit and, if necessary, to protect the downstream biological waste water treatment plant, waste water (mainly from the condensers and the adsorber regeneration, after phase separation) is treated thermally (at temperatures above 100 degC and a high pH) or using a solid catalyst to decompose organic peroxides to non-ecotoxic and more readily biodegradable compounds (such as methanol and formic acid). \n\nThe decomposition reaction may lead to the formation of gas (hydrogen).\nTechnical description\nNo information provided.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nPrevention of increased emissions to water due to malfunctions of the biological treatment which can be caused by high levels of organic peroxides.\nReduced emissions of peroxides to water (although the effect may be low, depending on the removal efficiency in the biological treatment).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor information on environmental performance, see Table 8.2 in Section 8.3.2.1.\n\nNo data were provided for the concentration of peroxides at the outlet of the final treatment but it is expected to be far beyond the detection limits reported in Table 8.2 (50-100 mg Combined Heat and Power (CHP)/l).\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumption of energy (heat).\nPotentially a small waste gas stream (mainly hydrogen).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nNo information provided.\n\nEconomics\nOperational costs are estimated to be low (mainly supply of heat and, if needed, caustic).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental protection.\n\nExample plants\nOf the seven plants in the European Union (EU), four use thermal treatment (Borealis (SF), Porvoo (FI); Ineos Phenol, Gladbeck (DE); Ineos Phenol, Antwerp (BE);  Novapex S.A.S., Roussillon (FR))  and one catalytical treatment (DOMO Caproleuna, Leuna (DE)) (see Table 8.2 in Section 8.3.2.1).\n\nReference literature\n.

Criteria governing the choice of the catalyst for first-stage hydrogenation are:\n\na high hydrogenation activity to fully hydrogenate the diolefins, alkenyl aromatics and other gum precursor compounds, at the lowest possible temperature;\na low polymerisation activity to reduce gum formation to a minimum and allow long enough operating cycles even with highly reactive feeds;\na high selectivity towards the hydrogenation of diolefins and alkenyl aromatics while minimising the hydrogenation of the olefins into paraffins.\n\nCatalysts for first-stage reactors are of two basic types, palladium- or nickel-based catalysts. Both catalysts make use of an alumina carrier. Palladium catalysts are generally more active than nickel catalysts but are (typically) less tolerant to feed poisons. However, this depends to a great extent on the anticipated poisons (feed impurities) that can (occasionally) be present in the pygas feed. Nickel catalyst is disadvantaged in that it requires more stringent loading, activation and unloading procedures. The option of switching from palladium to nickel or vice versa in existing units is restricted due to differences in the activity and the handling procedures.\n\nThe catalyst type is generally dictated by the (anticipated) quality of the raw pygas feed. For clean feed applications, use of palladium catalysts will result in a smaller reactor volume requirement. \n\nThere are various measures that reduce spent catalyst generation:\n\nFeed pretreatment / optimisation of upstream conditions to reduce the ingress of impurities. For example, water or dust removal by applying decanters and coalescers/filters for  protection from water and suspended solids from storage. \nFeed purification: First-stage hydrogenation and removal of the high-boiling fraction, as well as C5 hydrocarbons. C5 hydrocarbons can reduce the amount of fouling-forming compounds in the feed to the second hydrotreatment stage. The two distillation columns involving the removal of the heavy fraction, as well as C5 hydrocarbons, can reduce the amount of fouling-forming compounds in the feed to the first-stage hydrogenation, but feasibility is dependent on the configuration of the plant. Stabilisation of the high-boiling fraction can be important to avoid issues in downstream processes or fuel oil blending, e.g. when hydrogenated C5 hydrocarbons are routed to the petrol production in a refinery.\nLower operating temperatures to avoid oligomer or gum formation. \nProper liquid recycling to dilute the inlet concentration of diolefins to minimise polymerisation and subsequent coking.\nProper regeneration of the catalyst.\nTimely regeneration as coke on the catalyst becomes harder and, as such, hydrogen stripping becomes less effective and steam-air stripping is required.

The process technology addresses the management of strategically important REEs resources relevant for green energy and smart/hybrid technology. The methodology involves cheap mineral acid for near quantitative RE metal sequential digestion and extractive (liquid-liquid) separation protocols using the selective extractant ligand molecules and hydrometallurgical process conditions to separate Y, Eu, and Tb, to more than 99% purity and Gd, La and Ce to elevated purities each from the metal digested FP waste fractions.

The process can be employed to REE mixtures from e-waste as well as mining tailings origin. The process has the advantage over inseparable combined digested phosphor fractions as well as over inefficient leaching of Tb from LAP phosphor.

Unless otherwise stated, all the technique descriptions (10-heading format) can be found in the Large Combustion Plants (LCP) BREF and so are not repeated here.\n\n\nPrimary techniques for NOX\n\nChoice of fuel: Increasing the use of gas (i.e. natural gas and/or fuel gas) instead of liquid fuels will reduce the formation of NOX. However, the applicability may be limited by several factors: if the fuel gas has a high hydrogen content this could result in higher combustion temperatures and hence increased NOX formation; the design of the burners in the case of existing plants; or the overall hydrocarbon balance of the site (liquid or solid residues, produced on site, that have a high calorific value will be burnt on site to provide energy where it is not economical to recover substances from the residues).\n\nLow-NOX and ultra-low-NOX burners: `Low-NOX' burners have the potential to reduce NOX formation because of their ability to reduce both peak flame temperature and peak oxygen concentration through the use of the staged addition of either air or fuel. The effect can be enhanced by the recycling or entrainment of combustion gases as in the case of `ultra-low-NOX' burners. For existing process furnaces/heaters, the applicability may be restricted by their design.\n\nFlue-gas recirculation: Recirculation of part of the flue-gas within the combustion chamber to replace part of the fresh combustion air, with the effect of reducing the oxygen content and therefore reducing the temperature of the flame.  This will reduce the potential for NOX formation. Flue-gas recirculation can be an inherent feature of ultra-low-NOX burners (as discussed above), sometimes referred to as internal flue-gas recirculation, or it can be implemented as a distinct strategy that is not directly linked to ultra-low-NOX burners (external flue-gas recirculation). For existing process furnaces/heaters, the applicability may be restricted by their design (e.g. not applicable to existing EDC crackers).\nStaged combustion: Staged combustion achieves lower NOX emissions by staging the injection of either air or fuel in the near-burner region. The division of fuel or air reduces the oxygen concentration in the primary burner combustion zone, thereby lowering the peak flame temperature and reducing thermal NOX formation. The applicability may be restricted by space constraints when upgrading small process furnaces, limiting the retrofit of fuel/air staging without reducing capacity.  For existing EDC crackers, the applicability may be restricted by the design of the process furnace.  \n\nUse of inert diluents: 'Inert' diluents, e.g. steam, water, nitrogen, are used (either by being premixed with the fuel prior to its combustion or directly injected into the combustion chamber) to reduce the temperature of the flame. Steam injection may increase CO emissions. The technique is generally applicable.\n\n\nSecondary techniques for NOX\n\nSelective non-catalytic reduction (Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)). Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) is a non-catalytic process for removing nitrogen oxides from combustion flue-gases by gas phase reaction with ammonia or urea at high temperatures (850-1 100 degC). Reductions of 25 % to 75 % can be achieved, reducing NOX emissions to less than 200 mg/m3. Wet scrubbers can be used downstream of Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to remove ammonia slip and so enable the deliberate overdosing of ammonia into the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system. The ammonia recovered in the scrubber can be recycled to the Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) unit. Applicability to existing process heaters/furnaces may be restricted by the temperature window (900-1 050 degC) and the residence time needed for the reaction. \n\nSelective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)), also known as catalytic DeNOX. The ammonia/urea vapour is mixed with the flue-gas through an injection grid before being passed through a catalyst to complete the reaction. Various catalyst formulations are available for different temperature ranges: zeolites for 300-500 degC, traditional base metals employed at 200-400 degC, and metals and activated carbon for the lowest temperature applications at 150-300 degC. The catalyst's minimum operating temperature depends on the concentration of SO3 (see the CWW BREF). With Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), removal efficiencies of 80 % to 95 % can generally be achieved for inlet concentrations over 200 mg/Nm3. Residual NOX stack levels of 10-20 mg/Nm3 can be achieved by using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in gas-fired boilers and furnaces and NOX emissions of < 100 mg/Nm3 can be achieved when firing heavy residues. Applicability to existing process furnaces/heaters may be restricted by space availability.\n\nIt is important to take account of emissions to air of ammonia from the application of both Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). The dosing of ammonia or urea should be optimised for achieving effective NOX reduction without excessive ammonia slip; typical emissions of ammonia from these units are in the range of 5 mg/Nm3 to 15 mg/Nm3.\n\nData for emissions of NOX in connection with abatement techniques have been reported for the process furnaces used to produce:\n\nlower olefins (see Section 3.4.1);\nVinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) (see Section 11.4.1).\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4154967_abstract", "x": 0.66804856, "y": 0.25089565, "title": "FLUE GAS INTEGRATED DESULFURIZATION AND DENITRATION METHOD BASED ON LOW-TEMPERATURE ADSORPTION PRINCIPLE", "year": 2023, "text": "Provided is a method for desulphurizating and denitrating a flue gas in an integrated manner based on low-temperature adsorption.

The resulting mixture is heated, and then maintained at the desired temperature and pressure for a fixed period of time whilst passing through a plug flow reactor. \n\nThe temperature range employed is between 269 degC and 290 degC for high-pressure wet oxidation and between 120 degC and 220 degC for low-pressure oxidation. The operating pressure ranges from 80 bar to 120 bar for the high-pressure process and from 8 bar to 29 bar for the low-pressure process. The spent scrubbing liquor's residence time within the plug flow reactor is normally between 45 and 90 minutes, although longer times are required for low operating temperatures. For low-pressure oxidation, a catalyst (e.g. Fe(II)) is required.\n\nSee also the CWW BREF.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAchieved environmental benefits include the reduction of emissions of volatile compounds to air and the reduction of odour emissions.\n\nSulphides will be converted to thiosulphates, sulphites and/or sulphates. This may remove the immediate problem of odorous emissions to air, but the potential for the formation of sulphides still exists, and the likelihood of this will depend on the handling of the effluent, and the operation of the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP), which falls within the scope of the CWW BREF. The potential conversion of sulphides only to sulphites may not necessarily avoid problems with the operation of any downstream biological effluent treatment plant. \n\nBesides Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC) may also be reduced, including the organic load from phenols and oils. This could also help reduce the possibility of the performance of any downstream waste water biological treatment plant being adversely affected by receipt of this effluent. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe operating regime of the wet air oxidation plant will have a significant bearing on performance. Increasing the operating temperature, retention time or partial oxygen pressure will increase the proportion of sulphides converted to sulphates (and correspondingly reduce the proportion of sulphides converted to thiosulphates and sulphites), and will also increase the reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) that is achieved.\n\nCross-media effects\nThere will be an energy demand for pumping, heating and pressurisation. However, the oxidation is exothermic and carried out under pressure, so a high degree of heat recovery should be possible, and the process could be autothermal in some circumstances.\n\nThe depressurisation of the treated liquor could liberate some VOCs to air, which may need to be destroyed by incineration, which necessitates further energy (fuel) consumption.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUnder higher temperature operation, bisulphate formation in the absence of sufficient residual caustic could result in acid corrosion. The plant's materials of construction must be appropriate.\n\nEconomics\nLow-temperature (and therefore low-pressure) plants do not need to be constructed to withstand such high pressures, so their capital costs may be lower. However, the need to supply greater airflows in order to maintain efficient mass transfer means that their operating costs can be much higher.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProtection of the workforce by reducing the risk of exposure to hydrogen sulphide. \nImprovement of the operability and robust operation of any downstream biological effluent treatment plant.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique is reported to be used by 11 plants responding to the questionnaire.\n\nReference literature\nNo reference literature provided.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2995320_abstract", "x": 0.74054444, "y": 0.3107783, "title": "DEVICE FOR THE EVAPORATION OF VOLATILE SUBSTANCES", "year": 2016, "text": "The volatile substances evaporation device comprises a body (1) which can house an element (2) impregnated with volatile substances; an electric resistance (4); and a plug (5) for connection to a power grid; and said electrical resistance (4) is positioned in said plug (5) and said plug (5) is movable with respect to said body (1) so that the distance between the element (2) and said electrical resistance (4) is variable, defining at least one position of maximum evaporation and one position of minimum evaporation.It permits very simple adjustable evaporation with a reduced cost compared to other devices with adjustable evaporation.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"10.4.2.3.2\" title=\"Evaporation\">\n\n<content>\nEvaporation\n\nSee the CWW BREF for a description of the technique.\n\nKey steps normally involve concentrating the contaminant in the water stream using evaporation (either single or multiple stages).

The techniques that reduce Total Suspended Solids (TSS) will also reduce the PCDD/F content.\n\nBesides the measurement of pH for the operation of the treatment, monitoring of the solids content in the outlet is required to ensure good performance.  \n\nChemical precipitation, flocculation and membrane filtration are all described in more detail in the CWW BREF.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of pollutant emissions to water (copper and PCDD/F) and in waste (sewage sludge from biological treatment).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTable 11.26 lists the average concentrations from the data collection and the corresponding specific loads for copper, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and PCDD/F after pretreatment. Table 11.27 gives the ranges of annual averages for these parameters.\n\n\nTable 11.26:\tAverage pollutant content in EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) effluent after pretreatment \n\n\nTable 11.27:\tPollutant content in EDC/Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) effluent after pretreatment - ranges of yearly averages \n\n\nAll plants reported using flocculation/precipitation and filtration. Membrane filtration of the waste water is expected to result in very low levels of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and PCDD/F, which is confirmed by the PCDD/F data for Plant #3 (Table 11.23). Higher values reported for pretreatment indicate that in those cases filtration is not fully applied.   \n\nThe average emissions of suspended solids (Total Suspended Solids (TSS)) vary from 7 mg/l to 75 mg/l which mainly reflect differences in the operation of the treatment since they deal with similar waste water from the same process. The data show a correlation of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and PCDD/F concentrations.   \n\nFor Total Suspended Solids (TSS), two out of seven sites reported average Total Suspended Solids (TSS) concentrations (average of one to five years) of <= 10 mg/l (with 15 mg/l as the maximum annual average), a third site (Plant #8) reported having improved from concentrations of about 60 mg/l (first three years) to 9 mg/l (last two years). Two other sites reported average concentrations <= 20 mg/l (with 26 mg/l as the maximum annual average).\n\nFor PCDD/F, these plants are in the range of 0.2-0.6 ng TEQ/l (or 0.2-1.6 ng TEQ/l regarding maximum annual averages), corresponding to a specific load of 0.1-0.5 ug TEQ/t of oxychlorination capacity (or 0.2-2.1 ug/t regarding maximum annual averages) which for most sites/years is less than the ELV of 1 ug/t for the final effluent given in OSPAR Decision 98/4.\n\nThe average concentration for copper is in the narrow range of 0.2-0.6 mg/l for all plants. Discarding the worst performer for solids removal (Plant #15), all plants are in the range of 0.05-0.5 g/t of oxychlorination capacity (or 0.1-0.6 g/t regarding maximum annual averages) which is less than the ELV of 1 g/t for the final effluent given in OSPAR Decision 98/4. \n\nFor the pollutant content after combined final biological treatment (see Table 11.23), if related to the oxychlorination (fluidised bed) as the hypothetical only source, the corresponding specific loads would range from 0.03 g/t to 0.08 g/t of oxychlorination capacity for copper (discarding Plant #2 and, again, Plant #15) and 0.01-0.19 ug TEQ/t of oxychlorination capacity for PCDD/F which compares favourably with the ELVs from OSPAR Decision 98/4 mentioned above.\n\nCross-media effects\nSludge from solids removal (hazardous waste).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental legislation (e.g. OSPAR Decision 98/4).\n\nExample plants\nAnwil, Wloclawek (PL); Ercros, Vila-Seca (ES); SolVin, Jemeppe-sur-Sambre (BE); Innovyn, Martorell (ES); SolVin, Rheinberg (DE); SolVin, Tavaux (FR); SolVin, Zandvliet (Antwerp) (BE); Ineos ChlorVinyls, Tessenderlo (BE)\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3719397_abstract", "x": 0.7468779, "y": 0.3532846, "title": "BURNER FOR COMBUSTION OF GASEOUS FUELS IN SHAFT FURNACE, ESPECIALLY FOR HEAT PROCESSING OF MINERALS IN GRANULAR FORM", "year": 2020, "text": "The burner is placed inside the burner chamber (1) in a sheath of the shaft furnace and it has a supply pipe (2), which is connected to the source of the gaseous fuel.
