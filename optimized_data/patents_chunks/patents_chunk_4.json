However, this needs an overall view taking into account, for example:\n\nthe details of the objectives\nthe existing equipment (including infrastructure such as existing waste water treatment plant), existing or planned changes in process\nthe condition/suitability of the equipment for the current or planned tasks\npressures for change, such as meeting environmental quality standards\ncosts, including point in the depreciation curve for existing equipment.\n\nThere are trade-offs between the point source options and centralised or combined systems for purification/recovery. For example, a single fixed location recovery systems (e.g., centralized reverse osmosis/ion exchange for recycling rinse-waters from several process lines). Another combined strategy would be to use a mobile system to perform intermittent purification/recovery of several point sources. For example, a single mobile diffusion dialysis system might be used to purify/recycle several different acid baths. Combined strategies may be more cost-effective, due to economy of scale, unless there are substantially increased plant interface requirements: for example, a typical waste water treatment plant is based on combining all the flows (see Sections 2.13.1 and 4.16). Point source systems, in part or completely, may offer more flexibility, redundancy, reliability and may be more cost-effective. In some cases, techniques can be combined to achieve zero, or close to zero, discharge (see Section 4.16.12). \n\nExamples of combining techniques\nThere are several techniques that can be used to enable water to be re-used in processes and/or for the final cleaning of waste waters to meet low emission requirements, see Annexes 8.5 and 8.11. \n\nDescription\nThe final cleaning of waste waters by using chelating cation exchange resin is more efficient when carried out after effective metal removal. This can be by prevention and retention of raw materials (for example, see Sections 4.6 and 4.7), electrolytes (see Section 4.11.9) and/or precipitation (see Section 4.16.7). The efficiency of chelating cation exchange resin depends also on the effluent pH. The optimum pH is different for each metal. [121, France, 2003].\n\nThe removal of the metal (for example, with electrolysis,) may be most easily achieved at the rinsing stages (see Figure   4 .76 Section 4.7), where it most concentrated and prior to mixing with any other contaminants. High efficiency electrolytic cells increase the lifetime of the exchange resin.\n\nA combination of electrolysis and fluid bed technologies can be used on their own or in combination with semi-permeable membranes and ion-exchange technologies for the recovery of metals from polluted aqueous solutions, see Section 4.12.1(some of these are proprietary and patented).\n\nFigure 4.76: Removal of metal lost in rinsing prior to ion exchange\nChemelec cell, BEWT Environmental Services Ltd.\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAchieving low levels of metal discharged.\nPotential to re-use rinse-waters.\n\nIon exchange systems require space, not only for the resin columns but also for the regeneration plant. They also require sufficient expertise to control the regeneration and the produced water quality. For small installations, commercial systems operate where the resin columns are exchanged with a supplier who regenerates the resins at a central facility.\n\nCross-media effects\nPower consumption, especially at low concentrations, unless a high efficiency cell is used.\n\nOperational data\nSee Section \n\nApplicability\nWide applicability on precious and non-precious metals.\n\nEconomics\nThere are several parameters that can have a significant effect on the capital cost but the central ones are the sustained flow through the ion-exchange and the level of metal contamination. Introducing metal recovery in the process line can remove 95 % of the metal transferred to the ion exchange resulting in a 2000 % increase in the time before the resin needs to be 'refreshed' (or alternatively the amount of resin and therefore the size and cost of the equipment can be reduced significantly):\n\nnominal capacity:\t\t\n<1 m3/hr at 100 ppm\t\tGBP 25000 (June 2003)\n<3 m3/hr at 100 ppm \t\tGBP 47000\n\nEffluent treatment: The standalone units, which require minimal civil engineering works to install (i.e. pipe runs and level hard-standing) are modular in design and cater for a range of continuous flow of effluent from 0.5 to 9.0 cubic metres/hour of rinse solution. Capital costs vary dependant upon the number of stages of treatment prior to the final settlement tank and the level of process monitoring that has to be included and the method of off-site discharge.

This replaces depleted solution at the surfaces and prevents the build-up of gas bubbles and contaminants at the workpiece or substrate surface, giving uneven finishes, pitting, etc. In barrel treatments, sufficient agitation is usually achieved by the turning of the barrels and movement of the workpieces within.\n\nAgitation of anodising solutions is essential to maintain a constant temperature in the bath and remove heat from the surface of the aluminium.\n\n\nThe options are:\n\ncompressed air through nozzles\nlow pressure air\nhydraulic turbulence\nagitation of the workpieces by moving the flight bars or rods by cams or motors.\n\nThe use of compressed air gives high evaporative heat losses, especially when used in conjunction with air extraction, see Section 4.4.3, as well as energy consumption by the compressor. However, the energy losses may be negligible when used in very small tanks.\n\n\nHydraulic turbulence is by a pumped system with eductor nozzles placed at the bottom of the tank. Although the energy required is greater than that needed for traditional air or cathode rod agitation, the energy loss through evaporation of water in air agitated tanks offsets the higher energy usage of hydraulic turbulence. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe energy consumption when using air agitated systems is considerable, see Section 4.4.3.\n\nCross-media effect\nAir agitation may create or exacerbate sprays, mists or fumes of airborne particles or droplets. These may contain chemicals harmful in the workplace and/or in the environment, if removed by extraction systems.\n\nCompressors for air agitation may be a source of noise.\nAir agitation can be the source of large energy losses, see Section 4.4.3\n\nOperational data\nHydraulic turbulence provides greater agitation than air systems. This results in improved plating quality, reduction of rejects, and optimisation of proprietary additives consumption.\n\nAll systems need to be operated at a level that is effective in moving the solution, but does not cause displacement of workpieces from jigs. Displaced parts left in the solution often cause contamination problems (see Section 4.11).\n\nApplicability\nAll process tanks requiring agitation.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCosts saved in energy consumption, improved process quality, improved workplace health and safety.\n\nExample plants\nBodycote, Uxbridge, UK (formally West Middlesex Plating)\n\nReference literature\n[3, CETS, 2002], [18, Tempany, 2002] [118, ESTAL, 2003].\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3257702_abstract", "x": 0.39875314, "y": 0.7579586, "title": "MOVABLE CHARGING APPARATUS", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention provides a movable charging apparatus comprising a house, at least one storage portion and a plurality of movable units.

The reduction in extraction rate increases may be more than 90 % (subject to a German patent). A major advantage of this system is that these lids need no drive at the station itself, since they are moved simultaneously with the drip tray of the transporter.\n\nLids hinged to the tank, driven individually and automatically opening and closing when jigs and barrels enter and leave the processing tank are another appropriate but more expensive design. Usually this system is combined with a device designed to automatically increase the volume of extracted air when the lids are opened. A reduction in extraction rate of up to 90 % may be achieved. \n\n(2) Push-pull system\nThis method is designed to create an airflow over the surface of the processing bath. It works with an extraction hood opposite a blowing duct. The surface of the processing solution must not have any frame or obstacle to the airflow. Therefore its application remains quite limited.\n\n(3) Enclosure of the plating line\nRecently, the complete segregation of the process plant has been achieved in some installations.. The plating line is installed inside an enclosure, while all plant operations, the plant management systems, and the loading/unloading stations are located outside; see Section 4.2.3. Since a substantial amount of extracted air is still necessary to prevent corrosion of the equipment within the enclosure, an energy saving higher than the figures for other techniques cannot be expected.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of the volume of extracted air reduces energy consumption and any required treatment processes, chemicals, etc.\n\nApplicability\nAttention needs to be paid to energy efficiency in all installations using air extraction. \nProcess control is feasible for all installations. Other options will be site-specific.\n\nWhere the processing line is enclosed, the maintenance of the plant and solutions may become more complicated and time-consuming This technique is likely to be most effective with new installations, rather than retrofitting.\n\nEconomics\nCase-specific, but see the Example Plant below where the operational savings gave a two year payback, and one year payback if capital savings are included.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nHealth and safety in the work place.\n\nExample plant\nSee Annex 8.9, Goodrich Aerospace Landing Gear Division, Tullahoma, Tennessee, US, \n\nReference literature\n[3, CETS, 2002, 113, Austria, 2003]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2910667_abstract", "x": 0.3994438, "y": 0.4055402, "title": "CYANIDE-FREE ACIDIC MATTE SILVER ELECTROPLATING COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS", "year": 2015, "text": "Cyanide-free acidic silver electroplating compositions include one or more acids or salts of tellurium and may be used to electroplate matte silver deposits on metals, such as nickel, copper or copper alloys.

However, it is now under investigation (see Annex 8.2) and the OECD Task Force on Existing Chemicals has already agreed that it is persistent, bio-accumulative and toxic.\n\nNo substitutes for Nonyl Phenyl Ethoxylate (NPE) have been reported.\n\nSubstitutes are available and in use for anodising.\n\nThere are currently no substitutes for PFOS in Cr(VI) plating and pickling because of its strong resistance to oxidation. PFOS is also used in alkali cyanide-free zinc processes to reduce spray, as well as zonc alloy plating, some anodising and strong acid gold processes.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSubstitution by less harmful substances, or alternative processes will reduce the environmental and health effects.\n\nCross-media effects\nPFOS has important health and safety functions in controlling the spray from harmful solutions.\nIncreased extraction of Cr(VI) and other air pollutants due to cessation of use may require additional scrubbing and treatment.\n\nOperational data\nIn situations where PFOS has been used, such as Cr(VI) plating, other measures may be taken to prevent Cr(VI) mist reaching MAC levels in the workplace, such as use of floating insulation (see Section 4.4.3), lids on tanks and/or redesigned and/or upgraded ventilation (see Section 4.18.2), substitution by a less harmful process (see the appropriate parts of this section), etc.\n\nIf PFOS has to be used, then it is best practice to use it in a closed loop process. Cr(VI) plating can be run on this basis. \n\nOther processes can be run with drag-out reduction and rinsing techniques to conserve PFOS in the process tanks, see Sections 4.6 and 4.7\n\nApplicability\nCr(VI) plating can be run on a closed loop system. Other processes can utilise drag-out and rinsing techniques to minimise the release of PFOS. Its use can also be minimised by controlling the addition of PFOS (or solutions containing PFOS) using surface tension measurements.\n\nOriginally, it was reported that no PFOS is used in France, but other reports suggest it is in use.\n\nEconomics\nCost of additional air extraction or control equipment.\nControl measures, such as surface tension measurements, are minimal.\nDrag-out measures also retain other materials.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nOccupational health legislation.

In order to solve this problem, for the purpose of de-leading treatment of a copper alloy molten metal, there is provided a cored wire for lead removal characterized in that a metal band which does not affect the components of a copper alloy molten metal is used as a sheath material; a single de-leading agent and/or a de-leading coagent such as an aggregation/floatation agent for a Pb-Ca compound required for a step is used as contents; and physical properties that endure mechanical and continuous feed by a cored wire feeding device are provided.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.13.2\" title=\"De-embrittlement\">\n\n<content>\nDe-embrittlement\n\nDescription\nDe-embrittlement is heat treatment carried out after certain processes to avoid the unwanted embrittlement caused by hydrogen being trapped in the crystalline structure of metal substrates.

A further option is the use of ion exchange units built into a recirculation rinse loop with periodical regeneration. Precious metal is then recovered by electrolysis from the concentrate. This has been successfully used for silver.\n\n\nPalladium used in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) industry is recovered from acid solutions containing chloride (pH about 2), where it is present as a chloro-complex, using strongly basic ion exchange resins. The same process readily allows its separation from copper. The typical resin capacity (the same type of resin as used for gold) varies from 30 to 50 g of Pd per litre of resin.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCost recovery.\n\nReference literature\n[3, CETS, 2002]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3862071_abstract", "x": 0.56200516, "y": 0.3104173, "title": "WATER TREATMENT CHEMICAL FOR MEMBRANES AND MEMBRANE TREATMENT METHOD", "year": 2021, "text": "A water treatment chemical for membranes, which contains a polymer compound having a carboxyl group and a sulfo group, preferably a polymer compound represented by formula (1).

In addition to rinse-waters, the following waste waters streams can also contain metals:\n\nused process solutions from the electrochemical processes (electrolytes) \nused process solutions from chemical coating processes \nused process solutions from the pre- and post-treatment (cleaning, pickling, phosphating and chemical conversion)\nsolutions from separation and regeneration processes, such as ion exchange, retardation, dialysis, electrolysis\nsolutions from associated activities, such as exhaust scrubbers and filters, as well as from plant cleaning.\n\nGenerally the solutions and effluents are discharged into the effluent system. The treatment of the streams containing metal in the system essentially precipitates the dissolved metal ions as insoluble compounds. Normal precipitation with caustic soda solution and/or lime precipitates the metals as hydroxides and/or oxide hydrates. Precipitation may also be as carbonates and sulphides. The sludge produced has a water content of usually over 95 % and is drained by means of filter presses to about 60 % water content and is disposed of in this form as sludge.\n\nThe amount of sludge depends on various processing factors: \n\ncontamination of the input material \namount of metal oxides dissolved or eroded from the workpiece/substrate surfaces \ndischarge of process solution dragged-out by the workpieces/substrate\nservice lifetime of the process solutions.\n\nThat means that the generation of sludge without internal recycling measures is directly proportional to the drag out and the service lives of the process solutions. Generally, the metal losses by drag out related to the metal input material lies between 5 and 30 %. \n\nSurface treatment sludge is usually a mixture of metal hydroxides. It contains all non-ferrous metals used during the process, the workpiece substrate metals iron and aluminium, as well as calcium, potassium and sodium from the precipitation chemicals. \nDepending on the plating process, the non-ferrous metal contents (Cu, Ni) can amount to up to 30 %, for example, with monosludges (i.e. sludges from one process type only). The major part of the electroplating sludge is a mixture and has non-ferrous metal contents of about 10 %, as Table   4 .61 shows.\n\nTable 4.61: Typical composition of electroplating sludge from different sources\nUBA\n\n\nSome liquid wastes, such as end-of-life electrolytes or layer conversion solution may also be concentrated and treated in the in-house waste water treatment plant.\n\nOther wastes can be re-used or recycled externally, see 4.17.3.

Water is used to rinse the etching solution off the parts. The rinse-water carries dissolved aluminium and caustic to the plant waste treatment system.\n\nIf stabilisers are not used, the sodium aluminate concentration becomes too high and it will hydrolyse to produce alumina trihydrate (Al2O3 (H2O)3), liberating free caustic soda.\n\nHydrolysis reaction:\t2NaAlO2 + 4H2O - 2NaOH + Al2O3(H2O)3\n\nThis reaction, known as the Bayer process, is used in the primary aluminium industry to make alumina.

The gas flows through the column countercurrently to the liquid, thus extracting ammonia (stripping) in gas form. To enhance the liquid-gas contact, the columns are filled with specifically shaped pieces of inert material (packed column). The treated liquid is collected at the bottom of the tower and the ammonia-loaded gases leave the tower at the top, for further treatment. \n\nStripped ammonia is recovered by absorption in a second column (absorber), where the ammonia-laden gases are washed countercurrently with acid solution (e.g. sulphuric acid, iron sulphates, iron oxides) to dissolve ammonia and to produce a concentrated ammonium salt solution. In steam stripping, the output gas from the stripping tower is condensed to eventually produce a water solution of ammonia. The end product of the technology can be used as a fertiliser.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe removal of ammonia from the slurry results in a mitigation of potential ammonia emissions. During slurry landspreading, odours are also reduced. Nitrogen is recovered in a concentrated form as a salt or in a liquid solution, therefore nutrient management is easier and transport costs are reduced. \n\nCross-media effects\nEnergy consumption is increased. Depending on the working temperature, heating energy requirements may play a primary role in energy consumption .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe two fundamental control parameters of the process are the temperature and the pH, as they establish the equilibrium between ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+). The pH is usually set between 9 and 10, by adding an alkaline solution of soda or lime, or by previous CO2 stripping, so that ammonia can be released as a gas. For air stripping, typical working temperatures are set below 100 degC, whereas higher temperatures are characteristic of steam stripping. An ammonia reduction of up to 95 % is reported, under optimal conditions . Organic nitrogen, nitrites and nitrates are not removed. \nThe electricity consumption for air stripping is dependent on the process temperature, since, at higher temperatures, less air needs to be sent through the column. The consumption of electrical energy is reported from Belgium (Flanders) as 2.3 kWh/m3 of liquid, if the process is run at 20 degC, and 0.85 kWh/m3 if the operating temperature is 50 degC. The energy consumption for the stripping column only is reported as 14 kWh/kg of stripped nitrogen . In the case of steam stripping, the electricity consumption is 0.45 kWh/m3 liquid, while the consumption for thermal energy is equivalent to the production of 100 kg of steam per m3. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe quality of the ammonia salts or ammonia concentrate obtained increases when volatile organic matter has been previously removed. Therefore, mechanical separation of the solid-liquid fractions is usually required as a pretreatment, to reduce the dry matter content and avoid clogging.\n\nThe technique may be used in combination with anaerobic digestion, as a pretreatment that improves the ammonia stripping efficiency, reduces contamination of the final product by organic matter, and provides energy and heat required for the process. Due to the high heat demand, the technique may not be economically sustainable if heat from biogas production is not available [ 624, IRPP Technical Working Group (TWG) 2013].\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs are reported from Italy as EUR 350 000. For a plant located in Slovenia, treating 15 m3/h of slurry, the estimated investment cost for the stripping column was reported to be EUR 250 000. \n\nFor a mobile unit combining a centrifugal solid-liquid separator and ammonia stripping equipment, followed by a catalytic ammonia process, investment costs are reported to be in the range of EUR 350 000-400 000.

Slurry is discharged by opening a valve in the main slurry pipe. A slight vacuum develops and allows for a thorough slurry removal, better than by gravity alone. A certain depth of slurry needs to be obtained before the system can operate properly to allow the vacuum to develop and empty more slurry. The pit can be emptied once or twice a week; the evacuation frequency depends on the capacity of the pit or channel and on the weight of the pigs in the pens above, i.e. the same pit is filled up faster by 100 kg pigs than 20 kg pigs. The frequency of emptying will determine the volume of the external slurry storage required  .\n\n\nFigure 4.91:\tVacuum system in case of a fully slatted floor\n\n\nThe exact area covered by each pipe outlet depends on the dimension of the pen. In general, for every 10-11 metres in length, one pipe outlet is placed to discharge the slurry contained over the corresponding surface. An excessive number of outlets might increase the leakage possibility. The pen area served by each outlet is not considered to affect the emptying capability, as the optimum height of slurry required for the system to work is considered to be the same regardless of the area covered. As a larger pen area will accommodate a proportionately larger number of pigs, the optimum height will not take longer to reach. An optimal slurry depth is approximately 800 mm, regardless of the number of days it takes to reach it. It should be noted that slurry can be removed at a shallower depth, the minimum being 500 mm; however, this does not allow a sufficient vacuum to develop and results in more slurry being left in the system. \n\nHigh-powered submersible pumps are also used for infrequent intensive cleaning (every 2 years) with high-pressure water to remove crusting from around the tank edges. New houses can be fitted with pits with sloped bottom for an easier and complete emptying \n.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe frequent removal of slurry reduces ammonia emissions and is likely to reduce methane emissions. \nCross-media effects\nAs the system is manually operated, no additional energy is required nor is the additional working time significant. Less water is needed to clean the floor compared with partly slatted or solid concrete floors. It is suggested that any aerosols which develop during the discharge of the slurry are removed by the vacuum created when opening the valves. Because of the reduced storage period of the slurry inside the buildings, an additional capacity/volume of the external slurry store may be needed.\nThis technique can generate odour peaks at the time of emptying the slurry pits. It is proposed that emptying should not be more frequent than one or two times per month. \n\n\nIn Finland and Sweden, housing systems with fully slatted floors are not allowed due to animal welfare regulations. See also 'Cross-media effects' in Section 4.7.1.1 for fully slatted floors.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor the effectiveness of the removal, it is important that it takes place when the slurry is fresh. In order to evaluate the residence time of the slurry before being removed, the index of the ratio of volatile solids to total solids could be used. A value of about 75-80 % of the above ratio seems to be an index of acceptable fresh slurry .\n\nFrequent removal of slurry from the pit or channel reduces the pool of methanogenic bacteria within this environment . A reduction of methane emissions equivalent to 65 % has been measured in Spain for fattening pigs .

Forced ventilation is applied through tubes that blow 1.2 m3 of air per bird place per hour at a temperature of 17-20 degC (pullets and layers have different requirements) over the manure stored under the slats or over the manure being removed by the (aerated) belts .\n\n\nFigure 4.75:\tDeep litter systems with forced drying via tubes under the slatted floor\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe application of forced ventilation and the quick drying of the manure reduce ammonia emissions. Frequent removal with (aerated) manure belts can give even lower emission levels. Reduced odour levels can be expected. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe energy input in this system is high because a heating system must be installed to achieve the temperature necessary in the tubes (20 degC). Extra energy is also required to maintain the airflow. Air is drawn in through inlets in the side walls and though an open ridge construction in the roof. Aeration may trigger nitrification reactions that may result in an increased emission of N2O. In general, due to the dried manure, higher dust emissions are expected.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nManagement of this system is principally the same as for the reference deep litter design. Ammonia emissions of 0.125 kg NH3 per bird place per year are associated with this system in the Netherlands . The associated ammonia reduction is 60 % compared to the deep litter system (0.315 kg NH3 per bird place per year).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe system can only be used in laying hen houses with enough space underneath the slats. Traditionally the manure pit has a depth of 80 cm but when using this system it is necessary to add an extra 70 cm. The experience of farmers already using the deep floor system is that this type of system requires very little change to the traditional design.\n\nEconomics\nThe total cost for implementing this system in Belgium (Flanders) is EUR 32/bird place (VAT excluded), which corresponds to an extra cost of EUR 3.15/bird place in comparison with a conventional deep pit system (11 % higher). The additional energy requirements for the ventilation amount to EUR 0.17/ap/yr .\n\nExample plants\nIn the Netherlands, around 1 129 000 birds are housed in this type of system, about 3 % of the total Dutch laying hen population .

Multivalent cations (e.g. Al2(SO4)3, FeCl3) and/or polymer flocculants (e.g. polyacrylamide, chitosan) are added to the slurry in order to achieve particle aggregation. \n\nFlocculant agents aggregate suspended particles into larger particles whose size and other physical properties make them easy to separate from the liquid fraction. The addition is done in a small mixer tank, to achieve a satisfactory particle aggregation, before mechanical separation in a screw press, band filter, or decanter-centrifuge system. Prior to flocculation, a pretreatment step may be needed (e.g. by a filter belt press to remove 1-2 % of the dry matter content) in order to avoid the risk of clogging during the process and to lower the required consumption of chemicals. The aggregated clumps can be removed by sedimentation, filtration or flotation.\n\nA schematic representation of the coagulation-flocculation process is shown in Figure   4 .147.\n\n\nFigure 4.147:\tSchematic representation of a coagulation-flocculation pretreatment for slurry separation \nIf both additives are used, the multivalent ion is added first to the slurry. Several minutes of slow stirring are necessary to ensure homogeneous distribution of ions and dry matter and for charge neutralisation and coagulation to occur. Afterwards, the polymer is slowly added in small doses during vigorous stirring, followed by slow stirring, which is necessary for polymer bridging and patch flocculation to occur. The stirring conditions applied by the impeller (i.e. time and speed) have a large impact on the formation of the aggregates; too slow stirring causes the aggregates to be non-uniform and unstable with a low particle catchment, while too much stirring causes the aggregates to be destroyed .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe technique can significantly increase the efficiency of the separation of organic matter and nutrients in the solid fraction compared with other solid-liquid separation techniques. See also Section 4.12.2.1. The liquid fraction resulting from a mechanical separation treatment which is enhanced by chemical flocculation contains very low levels of phosphorus and has a low dry matter content (e.g. about 1 %) which allows a fast infiltration of slurry into soil after landspreading and, therefore, NH3 emissions to air are reduced.\n\nCross-media effects\nElectrical energy is needed to run the pretreatment (coagulation-flocculation), with associated indirect emissions. The environmental and health consequences of emission of flocculants to the environment, when applied to land, have not been fully investigated. The monomers of polyacrylamide (PAM), used in most slurry separation studies, can be toxic, and potentially carcinogenic. It has been shown that PAM degradation is rather limited in soil; it accumulates in the environment, does not degrade in the biogas production process, and easily dissolves in water, making it difficult to trace . \n\nOn the other hand, the results of a study carried out on separated slurry products report the risk to be minimal if a biological post-treatment is applied, since PAM is degraded in biological processes without acrylamide accumulation .\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe characteristics of the treated fractions are shown in Table   4 .306, for typical pig slurry, in Denmark and in Finland.\n\n\nTable 4.306:\tGeneral characteristics of the incoming slurry and the produced fractions after a mechanical separation process including flocculation \n\n\nIn Denmark, the proportion of total nitrogen in the dry matter fraction after separation with flocculation and a screw press is equal to 27 %. The respective proportion of phosphorus is reported to be 55 % . In Finland, a flocculation-enhanced separation consisting of a belt filter and a screw press removes from the raw slurry almost 50 % of the nitrogen and more than 90 % of the phosphorus . Additional operational data from the Netherlands are also presented in Table   4 .302 (see Section 4.12.2.1).\n\nThe process is reported to be very sensitive to the polyacrylamide concentration; an increase from 120 mg/kg to 140 mg/kg is capable of almost tripling the total dry matter of the solid fraction, but increases the ammonia and organic contents. As a result, the use of a polyacrylamide concentration greater than 120 mg/kg is not recommended where further anaerobic treatment is required .\n\nEnergy consumption for the application of this pretreatment (coagulation-flocculation) in combination with sieve separation treatment is reported to be in the range of 0.7 kWh to 2.0 kWh per tonne of manure. In a combined system in Finland, consisting of a filter belt, flocculation and a screw press, the energy requirement is reportedly around 3 kWh per m3 of treated manure . Flocculation is often used in combination with screw presses.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique is generally applicable to all types of slurry. The use of polyacrylamide as a flocculant may not be applicable due to the risk of acrylamide formation.\n\nEconomics\nFrom Denmark, a cost of EUR 20 000 is reported for each tonne/hour of capacity, for the application of coagulation-flocculation in combination with a sieve separator, which means approximately EUR 140 000 for a system with a capacity of 7 tonnes per hour. The annual operating costs have been calculated as EUR 1.3 per treated tonne. From other sources, operating costs are reported as EUR 0.8 per tonne of input slurry, and the investment costs around EUR 50 000 . From Finland, the annual cost of polymers for flocculation is reported to be EUR 3 000 for treating 6 000 tonnes of slurry per year . The labour demand in Denmark is estimated at approximately 0.25 h per working day.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSedimentation and separation are enhanced. A higher efficiency of mechanical separation techniques is achieved by modification of the particle properties, especially for separating particles belonging to the smallest particle fraction. The sediment of the flocculation and the solids from the subsequent mechanical separation treatment can be dried or further separated (e.g. using a screw press) into a solid fraction that contains most of the phosphorus from the raw slurry. The costs of manure storage, transport and application are reduced, which are key factors in areas with intensive livestock production. See also Section 4.12.2.1.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is relatively well known and is widely used for waste water and sewage treatment. It is estimated that in 2009 there were between 30 and 40 units in operation in Denmark for the separation of slurry with chemical precipitation by coagulation-flocculation, most of which are for pig slurry. In 2013 in Finland, this technique was in use on two pig farms and one dairy farm. The technique is also applied in France and Spain. \n\nReference literature\n     \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4059401_abstract", "x": 0.70581114, "y": 0.41547537, "title": "SELF-CLEANING DRYING CLEANING DEVICE, CLEANING STORAGE SEAT USED IN SAME AND CLEANING BRUSH HEAD DRYING CONTROL METHOD FOR SAME", "year": 2022, "text": "A self-cleaning drying cleaning device includes a cleaning appliance (88) with a cleaning brush head (20), and a cleaning storage seat (10) used to store the cleaning appliance (88).

To control the composting process and to achieve a better quality final product, substances of plant origin can be added to raise the carbon content. The application of additives aims to increase the porosity and binding of the nitrogen, thereby avoiding emissions to air.\nPoultry manure can be mixed with green residues, preferably woody crushed residues, by avoiding moving, in proportions from 1 to 1 (and up to 3 to 1) in weight (manure/green residues). Pig manure or slurry (liquid or solid fraction) can also be blended with organic materials for composting.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDepending on the origin of the manure and the co-substrate (vegetal matter) that is co-composted, a dilution effect of the nitrogenised load by 30 % to 60 % can be obtained.\n\nCross-media effects\nNH3 emissions can be controlled by proper management of the process, on the basis of the C/N ratio; otherwise, they can be considerable. Greenhouse gas emissions are very likely to occur during composting (see also Section 4.12.4.1).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nA typical poultry manure composition is 18 % bedding material, 50 % droppings and 32 % water, even though generally this does not correspond to the ideal composition for composting. Poultry manure contains cellulose and nitrogen, but moisture and the C/N ratio are relatively low. A more favourable C/N ratio for composting is 25-30, which is achieved by adding green wastes. Regarding moisture, it is necessary to increase the level by adding water from an external supply. Indicative values of the C/N ratio for different materials are presented in Table   4 .312. \n\n\nTable 4.312:\tIndicative values of the C/N ratio for different materials\n\n\nIn one example, poultry manure was mixed with pine bark, at an excreta/bark ratio of 3/1 on a total weight basis. In a comparison with other kinds of auxiliary substances, the pine bark showed the best results for pH level, nitrogen volatilisation and carbon content (organic material). \n\nThe composting took place at a temperature of 55-60 degC. A minimum porosity of the manure/bark mixture was maintained to allow an adequate oxygen supply. The test on compost produced with the addition of pine bark showed an unchanged (70 %) organic matter content (on a Dry Matter (DM) basis) after 90 days. The nitrogen losses reached about 35 % (on a Dry Matter (DM) basis) at 90 days and increased by 1-2 % over the next 90 days. The pH at 90 days was below 8, and reached 7.5 at 180 days.\n\nIn another reported example, straw pig manures were co-composted with woody pig manures (containing wood chips or sawdust). The weight reduction was 24-30 % and the nitrogen reduction 35-50 %. The presence of straw allowed a temperature increase of 10-15 degC, in comparison with composting the sawdust manure alone, over the last 3 months of composting . \n\nThe maturation time for compost in a heap, after a co-composting treatment, is reported to be longer. In particular, a duration of 4 to 5 months is needed for maturation when manure is composted with wood waste, in comparison with 6 weeks of active composting when only solid manure is composted .\n\nThe composition of turkey manure composted with wood waste in a proportion of 1/1 in weight is shown in Table   4 .313.\n\n\nTable 4.313:\tComposition variation of turkey manure co-composted with green residues (ratio 1/1 in weight) \n\n\nData on energy consumption for the equipment used in composting and co-composting plants are presented in Table   4 .314. \n\n\nTable 4.314:\tEnergy consumption of equipment used in composting and co-composting plants\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nSee also Section 4.12.4.1. The bark needs to be dried and ground before it can be added to the manure. Green residues can be pre-composted before their use.\n\nWhen co-composting is applied with wood waste, the necessary available area that composting normally needs should be multiplied by 1.5, in order to take into account the increased volume .\n\nEconomics\nSee Section 4.12.4.1.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSee also Section 4.12.4.1. Properly composted solid manure significantly reduces the volume of material to be transported and landspread and the amount of odour released. During composting, a high temperature is achieved and the product is stabilised and sanitised. \n\nComposting and co-composting allow the reduction of the quantity of nitrogen to be spread, at relatively low investment costs, where constraints to manure landspreading may exist and where local markets for alternatives to conventional fertilisers can be found. \n\nFarmers can participate in recovering compostable residues on behalf of the local community, offering an opportunity to solve problems of green waste locally.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is widely applied in Catalonia, Spain, where it is reported that there are 127 farm-scale plants and 21 medium-scale plants where organic materials are mixed with manure in aggregated composting activities . In general, across Europe, the technique is widespread, mainly at centralised plants where other organic wastes may be included for co-composting .\n\nReference literature\n    \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3782740_abstract", "x": 0.6757917, "y": 0.39797622, "title": "SIEVE SEPARATOR, GRINDING EQUIPMENT FOR POWDER COATINGS AND PROCESS OF CLEANING A SIEVE SEPARATOR", "year": 2021, "text": "A sieve separator (8), grinding equipment for powder coatings comprising such a sieve separator, and process of cleaning a sieve separator.

The controlled degradation of the organic matter, without oxygen, is influenced by the pH value and temperature. The main components of biogas are methane (50-70 %) and carbon dioxide (40-50 %) depending on the substrate used. Other minor components are: H2S, H2O, NH3 and N2O. The higher the methane content, the richer in energy is the gas. Biogas production strongly depends on the type of biomass feedstock used in the process. During anaerobic decomposition, four biochemical processes are distinguished: hydrolysis, acidogenesis (fermentation), acetogenesis and methanogenesis.\nThe produced biogas is collected and can be used to produce heat, i.e. hot water in a boiler, combined electricity and heat in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, or it can be used as an alternative fuel in vehicles or as a substitute for natural gas after upgrading to biomethane. Some of the heat generated may be recycled in the process. \n\nAnaerobic digestion of slurry generates a slurry-like digestate. Solid poultry and pig manure or the solid fraction from mechanically separated slurry can be co-digested with slurry and other organic co-substrates in wet digestion. The stabilised residue (i.e. digestate) can be landspread as a soil conditioner and source of nutrients (see also Section 2.7.4). Composting is an option before landspreading of digestate in the case of sufficiently solid digestate. An example of a biogas installation following anaerobic treatment of manure is presented in Figure   4 .151.\n\n\nFigure 4.151:\tExample of biogas installation, following anaerobic treatment of manure, located in Denmark \n\n\nThe requirements for plants producing biogas using animal by-products (including manure) are specified in Regulation (EC) 142/2011 (e.g. hygiene requirements, equipment, location and other parameters).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nEnvironmental benefits (direct and indirect) of the process of anaerobic digestion, with energy recovery from the produced biogas, are as follows: \n\nReduction of CH4 emissions, which would otherwise have been emitted from the outdoor storage of untreated slurry. \nSubstitution of fossil fuel consumption by electricity and/or heat produced by power-heat biogas cogeneration and/or by biomethane produced from biogas, avoiding associated indirect greenhouse gas emissions. \nReduction of NH3 emissions at landspreading compared to untreated manure; since the digestate is more homogenous and spreadable, it can seep more easily and evenly into the crop root area, enabling better nutrient uptake by crops. \nImproved bio-availability of nitrogen, leading to decreased use of mineral fertilisers. Anaerobic digestion does not change the overall N/P ratio but converts part of the organic nitrogen into ammonium, which is readily available for the crops. This results in an increased concentration of ammonium in digested slurry, up to 30 % depending on the manure digested, compared to untreated slurry. Due to the higher NH4-N content of the digestate, overall ammonia emissions are reduced provided the digestate storages are covered and the digestate is spread with low-emission methods.\nReduction of pathogens in digested manure (higher in a thermophilic range).\nReduction of odour emissions. The odour from digestate is not as strong and pungent as from untreated slurry, and it also disappears faster from a fertilised field, partly because the digested slurry percolates faster into the soil due to its lower Dry Matter (DM) content, lower particle size and viscosity.\nSubstantial reduction of COD and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), due to organic matter breakdown.\nSlurry can also be mechanically separated at the farm with only the solid fraction transported to a centralised biogas plant for digestion. A study reports that the associated environmental benefits in comparison with slurry landspreading without any prior treatment are dependent on the efficiency of the separation technology used. The separation of volatile solids (biodegradable carbon) should be as high as possible; a polymer addition may increase the efficiency. In addition, the solid fraction should be transported directly to the plant and immediately fed into the digester. If storage is needed, it should be short and in covered storages to minimise emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases  \n.\n\nIn all biogas plants digesting manure, the digestate directly from the digester is still biologically active and contains degradable organic matter, the degradation of which continues in the vessel into which the digestate is directed. This vessel should be made into a gas-tight post-digestion tank which collects the biogas still produced. With energy use of this post-biogas in conjunction with the biogas from the digester, significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be obtained .\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions of unburnt biogas through the biogas motor/engine are around 2 % but can be up to 4 % from older technology engines. Leakages of biogas (e.g. from the anchoring points of the meters) can lead to significant emissions of CH4 and other biogas components (NH3, H2S, etc.). Such emissions are known to vary significantly with equipment quality and the standard of maintenance. Best practice should aim to minimise fugitive methane emissions, since the operational efficiency of the digestion process will also be enhanced, thus maximising the production of energy . Including emissions during storage, total methane emissions of 6 kg CH4 per tonne of pig slurry, or 4-6 tonnes CH4 per tonne of poultry manure are reported from Belgium (Flanders).\n\nIn general, anaerobically digested slurry has a larger share of total N in the form of NH4-N. The higher content of NH4-N, in combination with the increased pH of the digested slurry, can lead to higher ammonia losses from storage and/or landspreading, compared with raw slurries. Due to the reduced content of organic matter, a natural crust is seldom formed on top of the liquid when it is stored in tanks, leading to a higher potential for emissions to air . Ammonia emissions from storage of the digested slurry can be high and stores should be covered and/or slurry immediately cooled, although losses during landspreading are reported to be lower than for untreated slurry . These effects may counterbalance the positive effect of a faster infiltration to the soil, so overall losses may be similar with untreated slurry after surface application.\n\nA high level of technical knowledge is needed on-farm to manage the whole process.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn general, digesters operate with a maximum dry matter content of 12 %, and at a constant temperature (with up to 2 degC variation) of 30-45 degC (mesophilic) or 52-55 degC (thermophilic, with an accepted temperature variation of only 0.5 degC). Plants operating at mesophilic temperatures are therefore easier to run, so most farm-scale plants, as well as many centralised plants, are of this type. \n\nThe process of mesophilic anaerobic digestion takes place in large digestion tanks, in one or two stages, and the hydraulic retention time is 15-40 days. Propellers are normally installed in the digestion tanks to ensure the digestate remains homogeneous and gives a maximum release of biogas. In the case of thermophilic digestion, the digester is heated to 55 degC and digestion takes 12-14 days. However, the technology is more expensive, since more energy and more sophisticated control instrumentation are needed. The advantages of thermophilic plants are higher levels of biogas production, faster throughput, improved hygienisation of the digestate, and lower viscosity during the process, facilitating mixing .\n\nVery short retention times decrease the level of degradation and thus may result in higher emissions later in the management of the digestate . The condition necessary for the successful formation of methane is a minimum water content of 50 % in the initial substrate .\n\nThe biogas production potential depends largely on the type of manure. Around 14-25 m3 of biogas production per m3 of slurry may be obtained (or even higher when pig slurry is digested), containing around 60-65 % methane. Calculations for biogas plants in Denmark show an average production of 22 m3 of biogas per tonne of pig slurry containing 6 % dry matter (on average) .\n\nIn order to maintain digestion, part of the heat produced during Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production is used to maintain the temperature of the biogas plant. About a third of the heat produced from such combined heat and power (Combined Heat and Power (CHP)) units is typically used for the anaerobic digestion process itself \n. This amount depends on scale and configuration. Net biogas power production is reported as 2.5 kWh per m3 of biogas and net biogas heat production as 2.0 kWh per m3 of biogas (after own use of heat and power in the process) .\n\nTo reach the required temperature, manure may be warmed up using part of the produced biogas or by heat exchange with the water cooling the gas engines. In farm-scale applications, heating of the manure is not always applied. The required parasitic energy load to maintain the digester is estimated to be around 5-20 % of the gross energy production of the installation, depending on the scale and configuration. The use of 20-25 m3 of biogas in the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant can produce 35 kWh to 40 kWh of electricity and 55 kWh to 75 kWh of heat energy . \n\nFrom Germany, net biogas power production is reported to be 2.5 kWh per m3 of biogas, and, 2.0 kWh per m3 of biogas as net heat production (after own use of heat and power in the process) . The resource efficiency of a combined heat and power (Combined Heat and Power (CHP)) system is about 35 % for the electrical production, or about 85 % if all the produced heat is recovered . \n\nThe biogas is stored in a gas buffer before being used in a heater or a gas engine. Before the biogas can be used, sulphur must be removed by a biological, adsorptive (active coal or ferro-chloride) or chemical technique (quenching) in larger installations, in order to protect the gas engine. A double membrane cover system is used to collect a quantity of biogas from the heated slurry digestate storage tank during the cooling phase of a continuous digester \n.\n\nDue to the general manure management required by the anaerobic digester, it is estimated that total farm emissions in Finland are reduced by 40 % for ammonia, while odour and methane are reduced by 80 % . N2O emissions associated with anaerobic digestion are reported to be negligible, compared to the overall annual N2O emissions from the farm.\n\nSince only a small proportion of the total manure mass is decomposed in a sealed anaerobic digester, the total content of nutrients in the digested manure does not differ much from raw slurries. However, data show a reduction in the slurry dry matter content of around 25 % between raw and digested slurries. The organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus are converted into water-soluble and readily available NE4-N and phosphorus. Digested manures show a 10-30 % higher proportion of NE4-N. \n\nCalculations made for the quantification of avoided greenhouse gas emission, as a result of fossil fuel substitution with biogas, show that the CO2-neutral energy produced by the biogas process saves 2 kg CO2 equivalent emissions per m3 of biogas. In addition, model calculations applied in Denmark show a reduction of naturally developed greenhouse gases (methane and nitrous oxide) of approximately 1.2 kg CO2 equivalent per m3 of biogas. In total, a potential of 3.2 kg CO2 equivalent reduction in greenhouse gases emissions per m3 of biogas are estimated .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThis technique may not be generally applicable due to the high implementation cost. There are no technical restrictions to its on-farm application. The cost efficiency is likely to increase with an increasing volume of fermented manure. The minimum farm size according to the literature (see Reference literature below) is 50 Livestock Units (LU) .\n\nThe biogas production capacity of pig slurry is relatively low; hence, it often requires the addition of a proper co-substrate to increase efficiency. Possible sources of such substances are energy plants, green wastes, sewage sludge, and food residues . For this reason, in France, Denmark and Spain, biogas production is not considered technically and economically viable with only slurry as a substrate . In Spain, a slurry biodigestion plan has been developed, with the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in the livestock sector. \n\nEconomics\nThe economics of anaerobic digestion systems are highly site-specific and depend on factors such as land and labour costs, effluent discharge regulations, and prices for energy produced by other sources. Where government incentives include a premium price for the electricity produced and in the case of environmental pressures that force farmers and related industries to consider alternative means to manage manure and organic wastes, the technique with associated biogas production can be economically viable. \n\nA reported example from Finland of a farm with 263 places for farrowing sows and 784 places for weaners indicates an investment of EUR 3 536 per animal place and an operating cost of EUR 40 per animal place per year. The annualised costs are given as EUR 656 per animal place. Electricity generated on-farm is reported to be 453 000 kWh and the produced heat 700 000 kWh (equivalent to 77 000 litres of fuel oil), allowing the farm to be self-sufficient in heat and electricity .\n\nAn example of a biogas plant for a small-scale farm is reported from Denmark, where pig slurry alone is used as a substrate for biogas production. The farm has a capacity equivalent to 2 950 fattening pig places (> 30 kg) and 500 sow places. Operational data and costs associated with the production of biogas are presented in Table   4 .315.\n\n\nTable 4.315:\tOperational and cost data for a biogas plant applied on a small-scale farm, operating with pig slurry only\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nHigh investment and operating costs are a major deterrent for the implementation of this technique; therefore, the availability of grants and high renewable energy prices would be needed to motivate the implementation of on-farm anaerobic digestion facilities . For this reason, in some Member States, the use of biogas in connection with the covering of the pig slurry stores is stimulated by financial incentives (e.g. Italy, France, Germany and Spain). \n\nFarms can achieve self-sufficiency in electricity . The heat produced by cogeneration of heat and power can also be transferred to external users for residential district heating and commercial heating requirements. \n\nEnvironmental policy targets for renewable energy, together with uncertainty about oil prices, may encourage the use of this technique. Co-processing with animal wastes from the food and meat industry may increase due to the increased costs of disposal brought about by the Animal By-products (Animal By-products (ABP)) Regulations .\n\nExample plants\nCentralised manure co-digestion installations where manure and/or energy crops and organic biological waste are used as inputs are common. In 2011, there were 180 anaerobic digesters in the Netherlands and 23 in agricultural areas of Belgium (Flanders). Around 30 farm-scale digesters are located in the UK and 3 in Belgium (Flanders). A biogas plant in Austria has been reported to be in operation since 1995. In 2003, in Italy about 50 low-cost digesters were installed, using gas which develops under the covers on slurry storage operating at low temperatures. \n\nFor the Baltic Sea region, the number of existing biogas plants for manure digestion and the amount of manure digested (estimated for the year 2012) are presented in the following table.\n\n\nTable 4.316:\tNumber of existing biogas plants for manure digestion and the amount of manure digested in the Baltic Sea region countries (estimated for year 2012)\n\n\nAn example plant is reported from Austria (Hirnsdorf) where a farm-scale biogas plant is loaded with pig slurry and other materials (laying hen manure or wastes). The biogas reactor has a volume of 750 m3 and treats around 4 500 m3 of substrate every year in bimonthly batches (the residence time is 50-60 days on average). The gas that is produced is desulphurised and fed to a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant made up of two engines, with a maximum electrical power of 2 x 57 kW. Excess gas is stored in a dry gas silo reservoir. The electricity produced supplies the farm's own requirements and the excess power is fed into the public grid (between 2 000 kWh and 6 000 kWh per month). However, for the in-farm peak demands, external power has to be bought. The waste heat from the process is recovered and used in winter to heat the sorting hall and the pig houses, as well as to fully condition the gas reactor itself. From March to September, the heat is also used to feed the maize-drying facility in the continuous flow dryer system.\n\nReference literature\n        \n           \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3260425_abstract", "x": 0.6085184, "y": 0.28592739, "title": "AERATION CONTROL IN WASTE WATER TREATMENT BY MONITORING NITRIFICATION BY-PRODUCTS", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention refers to a wastewater treatment process characterised in that in the aeration stage measurements are made, at intervals, of the gradient of the concentration of NH4 and N2O and/or NO over time and the air flow into the aeration tank is modified or maintained depending of the values of the concentration gradient of these parameters over time.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.12.4.1\" title=\"Composting\">\n<referenced_by>4.12.4.2, 4.12.4.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nComposting \n\nDescription\nComposting is the controlled aerobic degradation of organic matter. In the IRPP sector, solid manure, mixed or not with vegetal organic matter, is used in the process. Aerobic conditions can be achieved by mechanically turning or mixing a heap or pile with a tractor loader, for example, to incorporate air or by more specialised equipment. \n\nThe aim of the technique is to facilitate naturally occurring microflora to degrade cellulose and other carbon compounds in the manure to produce a material that is friable and sufficiently stable for storage and transport and that has a reduced volume. Compost, which is the final product, consists of stabilised organic matter, has a low moisture content and retains most of the initial nutrients. \n\nIn the initial phase of the process (decomposition), exothermic reactions produce a temperature increase in the composting matrix, above 50 degC in the thermophilic temperature range up to 70 degC, with consequent hygienisation of the product by the elimination of pathogens in the manure. Aerobic conditions are needed in order to enable the microorganisms to convert the input material by using the available nutrients, oxygen and water. When oxygen is depleted, manure heaps cool down and aeration should be restored by mechanical turning of the heap, as well as by forced aeration .\n\nIn a second, curing, stage, complex organic matter is degraded and humic and fulvic acids are produced. The temperature slowly decreases in the mesophilic temperature range (below 40 degC) to room temperature. The whole process lasts between 8 and 16 weeks. Run-off liquids are collected by shafts and pumped to a tank, from where they can be recycled on the composting silo or windrow .\n\nThe different composting systems are described below.\n\nComposting with mechanical reversal of heaps\nOn farm, the manure is usually arranged in windrows (long heaps with a trapezoidal or triangular section, typically 1-3 metres high, 2-5 metres wide and of indeterminate length) and monitored for temperature and moisture. The temperature needs close monitoring, especially during the first days. Run-off waters or slurry can also be added to increase moisture. The windrows are turned over and mixed periodically using conventional loading machinery (e.g. a bucket loader) or other available farmyard machinery (e.g. windrow turner). \n\nIn the first week of composting, it is recommended to turn the solid manure windrow twice to facilitate aeration and the development of high temperatures within the windrow . Later, reversals are necessary at intervals of 10 days to 3 weeks, in order to maintain the airflow in the middle of the heap. After the last reversal, it is then necessary to wait at least 3 more weeks .\nReversals have an immediate effect on the temperature. Several reversals are essential to ensure that all the compost has been subjected to a high temperature. The operation of reversal ensures homogenisation of materials, increases passive aeration, and provides the proper conditions for the aerobic decomposition. The period that active composting normally lasts ranges from 8 to 12 weeks. \n\nStatic aerated piles \nThis is an alternative method, which uses air supplied by perforated piping or a porous floor below the pile, therefore avoiding the reversal and mixing. Aeration can be forced (air is forced into the composting material) or passive (convective movement of air into the composting material).\n\nComposting in-vessel (with forced aeration)\nComposting is carried out in closed, aerated concrete silos/tanks or channels (composting vessels). The bottom of these modules is equipped with a system of perforated pipes, allowing forced aeration by blowing air into the substrate. The system is controlled by temperature sensors, allowing the aeration to be recorded and adjusted. Once the silo is charged with solid manure, a cover is anchored on the walls of the silo. Forced aeration is maintained for 6 weeks and then the silo is uncovered and emptied for the compost to mature in a heap . Composting drums can also be used.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe technique produces an organic fertiliser (compost) with part of the original inorganic, readily available nitrogen content converted to organic forms, and most of the phosphorus in a concentrated form (due to water evaporation). The organic matter is humified and the product is odourless and pathogen-free. As a result, during landspreading of the composted product, reduced odour and NH3 emissions, and emissions of nitrogen compounds from leaching, are expected  .\n\nThe benefits in terms of the fertiliser product obtained depend on the type of manure, the pretreatment technique, the additives, and on the composting technique, and cannot be quantified in a general sense. \n\nIn France, the product of composting (compost manure) is considered an organic fertiliser, deodorised and hygienised. It supplies organic matter to the ground, and the organic form of nitrogen allows a gradual release to the plants. A priori, compost manure may be applied in the autumn and winter without risking an increase in nitrate leaching .\n\nCross-media effects\nIn partly aerobic conditions, such as in unsealed manure heaps, part of the inorganic nitrogen (10-55 % of the nitrogen) is lost through volatilisation as ammonia emissions. N2O emissions and NO3- losses as leachate may also occur . The nitrogen losses reduce the fertiliser value of the manure, resulting in the need for supplementing it with a mineral fertiliser, with consequent increased indirect emissions for its production. Loss of carbon during composting also reduces the nutrient content of the resulting product. \n\nConditions during composting imply a risk of increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, since aeration leads to a temperature increase and, thereby, also to much higher activity of the anaerobic bacteria. Methane emissions are very likely to occur if anaerobic zones are developed inside the composting mass, as are nitrous oxide emissions in the case of improper aeration of the whole manure heap (i.e. anaerobic zones in the centre imply that there may be aerobic/anaerobic transition zones in the compost).\n\nThe volatilisation of nitrogen can also be reduced by means of a cover. Peat is suggested as the cover, as acid sphagnum peat (Sphagnum fuscum) has a better nitrogen-binding capacity than straw, sawdust or cutter chips for example. However, peat is a non-renewable resource and its extraction leads to significant emissions of greenhouse gases. On the other hand, it is also reported that covers were not found to have any significant effect on aerial emissions during composting in a study carried out in France .\n\nAir scrubbing systems for manure composting facilities are well tested as an additional method to reduce NH3 emissions from this source, but have significant costs . No composting installation at the farm scale is reported to be equipped with air cleaning systems \n.\n\nIf the heap is put on soil and not on an impermeable base, part of the nitrogen that sinks into the soil evaporates, and plants use part of it after the heap is removed. Depending on the amount of run-off, the soil surface and the soil type, part of the nitrogen may also leach into the surface waters or groundwater.\n\nAbout half of the potassium in manure may be lost due to composting. Potassium is lost only in run-off water, and these emissions can be reduced by means of a watertight cover over the compost. The cover prevents the leaching caused by rainwater, but it does not prevent the liquids produced in the compost from sinking into the ground. If composting is performed in a barn, losses to the soil or from leaching during the composting process are non-existent.\n\nIn the composting process, suboptimal conditions may eventually result. Odour emissions would be indicative of the occurrence, as odorous compounds are mostly volatile organic sulphur compounds produced under anaerobic conditions. In the case of silo composting with forced aeration, odours are controlled by incorporation of a neutralising product into the dry air. \nEnergy consumption is required, in particular when forced aeration is used for composting. Water is needed in the process to maintain a suitable moisture content of the manure \n.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nComposting periods may last up to 6 months or more, but can be shortened by frequent turning and aeration. The required operational parameters for composting using animal by-products (including manure) are specified in European Regulation 142/2011, as well as the specifications of the final compost products. The key operating parameters and transformation requirements are reported below.\n\nMoisture content between 40 % and 70 % . Below 30 %, bacteria activity is inhibited. In general, solid manures from deep litter housing systems (broilers, turkeys, guinea fowl) are not suitable for a smooth composting process, due to the high dry matter content, ranging between 65 % and 80 %. The ideal dry matter content should be about 40 % to 50 %; for the purpose, moisture (water, slurry, etc.) in sufficient quantity has to be added at the beginning of composting, at the time of building the windrows. As an example, one tonne of solid manure with a dry matter content of 75 % requires 500 litres of water in order to reach a dry matter content of 50 %. A very moist mixture does not favour composting because it prevents aeration . \nOxygen supply > 0.5 mg/l.\nPorosity of the heap between 30 % and 60 % (as air-filled porosity).\nCarbon/Nitrogen ratio (C/N) in the range of 20-35. \nTemperature of the heap between 50 degC and 60 degC. Product hygienisation is ensured by monitoring the temperature as an indicator. In general, if the material remains at 50 degC for over 6 weeks, most pathogens will be destroyed (viruses, bacteria and parasites), while, at a temperature of between 40 degC and 50 degC for 6 weeks, only parasitic worms are destroyed. At a temperature below 40 degC for 6 weeks, no sanitation occurs. A general practice is to maintain the temperature above 55 degC for 25 to 30 days \n. Hygienisation is also achieved if the temperature is kept above 55 degC for 2 weeks or above 65 degC for 1 week .\nRegulation 142/2011 sets the minimum temperature (70 degC) that all material must remain at without interruption for 60 minutes. However, the competent authority may authorise the use of other specific requirements provided that they guarantee an equivalent effect regarding the reduction of pathogens.\n\nThe use of tarpaulins for covering the windrows limits odour emissions and flies, allows better integration of windrows in the landscape (positive psychological effect on the neighbourhood), provides health protection from birds and rodents, and essential protection in case of heavy rain. A semi-permeable geotextile cover offers the advantage of being permeable to gas and allows good drainage of water on the surface of the windrow .\n\nFor the application of the composting technique in the UK, the readily available nitrogen content of FYM is typically reduced from 20-25 % to 10-15 % of total N (in composted FYM) due to NH4-N conversion to NO3-N and organic nitrogen. Composting has a smaller effect on the proportion of readily available nitrogen in poultry manure. Composting typically results in 40-50 % of the total N in FYM and around 15-20 % in poultry litter being lost (either as NH3, N2O or in leachate) . \n\nFor composting poultry manure in France, if reversals are very frequent, losses can be as high as 50-60 % of the total N present. With three reversals, losses are generally around 30-40 % of the total N present. After composting solid poultry manure, the volume and weight reduction is reported to be typically in the range of 30-50 % . \n\nAmmonia emissions can be reduced by composting manure with a high C/N ratio (20-35), and by carefully balancing the frequency of heap reversals, in order to achieve sufficient aeration with minimum disturbance. Nitrogen losses as high as 70 % have been reported, through ammonia volatilisation . The supply of air to composting (and aerobic digestion systems) requires a fine balance; too high airflows encourage NH3 volatilisation, while low flows encourage methane and nitrous oxide emissions .\n\nThe typical dimensions of windrows do not exceed 1.8-2 m in height and \n3.5-4 m in width . If the windrow height is excessive (more than 3 m), the resulting compression will not let air pass. If windrows are too small, they will be susceptible to cooling down easily . The area needed for composting manure coming from a 1 000 m2 building is reported to be 800 m2 for turkeys and between 750 m2 and 1 000 m2 for broilers . Windrows of approximately 3.5 m wide and 2 m high (corresponding to 6 m3/m of linear length) are needed. Also, a traffic lane of 4 m for the machines and 10 m to 15 m at the end of windrows is generally needed for facilitating manoeuvres.\n\nThe energy use depends on the composting technique applied. Without aeration and turning of the heaps, the energy use would be negligible. The energy consumption varies between 5 kWh/tonne of raw manure for turning only, and between 8 kWh and 50 kWh/tonne of raw manure for farms that apply ventilation through or over the heaps as well. From France, the energy consumption for composting by forced ventilation is reported to be 1 980 kWh of electricity per year and 480 l of fuel per year, to treat 600 t of manure . Water needs are reported to be between 250 l and 650 l/tonne of manure . A comparison of composting applied to different pig solid manures are described below in Table   4 .310, as reported by France.\n\n\nTable 4.310:\tNitrogen and weight losses during composting of solid pig manure, in France \n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nDue to cross-media effects, the technique is applicable when manure cannot be transported for landspreading at a reasonable cost and pathogen and odour reduction is important prior to landspreading. The technique requires enough space available for windrows to be established. \n\nThe process is relatively simple and can be applied on small-scale individual farms, using standard farm equipment, but it needs proper control to avoid anaerobic processes that could lead to an odour nuisance. If process control and emission reduction are required, then the composting installation needs to be larger for (cost-)efficient operation.\n\nIn France, the process can also be implemented for temporary field heaps of solid manure on flat soil with low permeability (in different places every year and without using the same field for at least 3 years). The process should not last more than 2 months.\n\nComposting should not be carried out on filtering soils, on waterlogged soils, or on sloped land. All measures should be taken to avoid stagnation of storm water under windrows and to accommodate the disposal of contaminated water . Specially designed composting machines or windrow turners do a more efficient job, but the high costs limit their use to large individual farms only. As a result, composting machinery is usually provided by cooperatives or machinery rings . \n\nEconomics\nComposting with mechanical reversal of heaps (windrow composting) \nThe operating cost, including the clearing out of the buildings, the formation of the windrows, two reversals and the spreading of the compost, is reported from France as follows :\n\nfor a pig farm with 550 fattening places, the cost is EUR 0.01-0.02 per kg of pig produced;\nin a poultry meat farm of 1 000 m2, the cost is between EUR 7.9 and EUR 9.9 per tonne of manure produced per year. \n\nThe purchase of necessary reversing tools in France is often shared, e.g. in Cooperative of Use of Farm Equipment (CUFE) (Cooperative of Use of Farm Equipment). The investment cost for a machine of 4 m in width, for working with windrows, is reported to be about EUR 42 000 . Other examples of investment costs for the necessary composting equipment are reported in Table   4 .311.\n\n\nTable 4.311:\tInvestment costs for equipment used in composting plants \n\n\nThe operating costs are reported to be equal to EUR 20/tonne produced, and the income from compost sales ranges from EUR 15 to EUR 30 per tonne. \n\nComposting in vessels with forced aeration\nThis system is economically viable only for large manure volumes in France. In a reported example, the investment costs for the equipment to treat 600 tonnes of manure per year is amortised over 10 years, resulting in an annualised investment cost of EUR 10 per tonne of pig produced (manure resulting from 2 700 fattening pigs per year), or EUR 6.2 per tonne of poultry manure (four buildings of 1 000 m2 each with 150 t of manure per building per year). The operating cost of the system (including clearing out of the buildings, handling of the silos and spreading of the compost) is obviously variable, depending on the production and the size of the farm. From France, the operating cost is reported to be equal to EUR 0.02 per kg of pig produced and EUR 11.4 per tonne of poultry manure .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nComposted solid manure has little odour, is more stable, contains fewer pathogens and is relatively dry. This improves handling, storage, transportation and landspreading without the risk of transferring diseases (e.g. landspreading on ready-to-eat crops)  . Transport costs are reduced due to the significant reduction of mass due to water evaporation. \n\nExample plants\nThe technique is applied at farm level, as well as in centralised plants, in various Member States; for example, 400 farm-scale plants are reported in the UK, 127 in Spain (Catalonia), 32 in Romania and 100 in France . In France, around 200 farms are affiliated with one commercial organisation using the forced aeration variant of the technique. \n\nReference literature\n             \n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3626816_abstract", "x": 0.4872912, "y": 0.07323767, "title": "BACILLUS SUBTILIS SUBSPECIES", "year": 2020, "text": "The present invention relates to novel subspecies of Bacillus.

Bacillus species produce extracellular degrading enzymes (amylases, cellulases, lipases, proteases, etc.). The addition of these microbes in pig feed provides a source of enzymes to animals, improving the nutrient digestion and the utilisation of feed, and thereby improving feed efficiency. These enzymatic activities are a likely explanation of the faster dispersion of manure in pens where pigs are fed with Bacillus. In fact, spores survive through the digestive process and germinate within the digestive tract, so that mature microbes are excreted with faecal matter and can also produce an enzymatic effect in the external environment. Lactobacillus and Enterococcus faecium rapidly install in animal intestines and improve the sanitary state and the growth performance.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe enhanced animal performance in feed conversion reduces the excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus, since more nutrients are retained in the animal bodies. However, the scientific evidence is not all conclusively positive on the consistent effectiveness of probiotics. Some test results showed that growth performance, feed conversion ratios and mortality were not significantly different after the use of probiotics in broilers . \n\nThe improved manure degradability induced by Bacillus improves pen cleaning, as it reduces the time taken to disperse the manure mat. \n\nCross-media effects\nNo negative effects are reported.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nBacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis strains are added in the feed at rates of around 0.05 % of a dietary supplement that contains some 10e+8-10e+9 cfu/g of product. Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10 415 is provided in doses of 7.0x10e+8 cfu/kg of feed for sows and starter diets, and in doses of 3.5x10e+08 cfu/kg of feed for grower and finisher diets. For both Bacillus and Enterococcus, improvements of the feed conversion rates are reported to be in the range of 0.37-0.38.\n\nThe effect of these probiotics is a reduced excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus, due to the increased efficiency of the feed conversion. The estimated effects in pigs are displayed in Table   4 .153.\n\n\nTable 4.153:\tReductions in excretion with the direct-fed microbial strains in pigs \n\n\nThe effect of Lactobacillus on broilers may vary depending on the combination of the dose and the protein content in the diet. An example is reported in Table   4 .154, where the effects on finishing broilers are displayed for different doses mixed with different levels of dietary content of protein and minerals (Ca and non-phytin phosphorus). The average reduction of total nitrogen in excretion is 7.2 %.

The present invention provides a device with the possibility of filtration with high working pressure, avoiding possible clogging inside the adsorbing material and easy regeneration and reactivation of the adsorbing material.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.9.5\" title=\"Biofilter\">\n<referenced_by>4.10.1.4</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nBiofilter\n\nDescription\nThe exhaust air of the animal house is led through a filter bed of organic material, such as root wood or wood chips, coarse bark, compost or peat. These materials are generally arranged in layers, i.e. the filter bed consists of coarse material on the untreated exhaust air side and finer material on the clean air side. Fine-grained filter materials have a relatively large specific surface area that facilitates mass transfer but, on the other hand, causes higher pressure losses. \n\nThe filter material is kept sufficiently moist at all times, so that microorganism populations can form a film. This is achieved by either humidifying the exhaust air to a relative humidity of at least 95 % and/or by controlled intermittent sprinkling of the surface of the filter material. Moistening of the entire filter surface is required in order not to compromise performance, even if the air entering is saturated; in particular in summer and in open surface filters, it is necessary to compensate for evaporation losses. Gaseous compounds are absorbed by the moisture film of the biofilter material and are oxidised or degraded by microorganisms living on the moisturised filter material.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBiofilters are mainly used to eliminate odours arising from houses with no bedding material. They can also be used in litterless housing for dust separation, if coarsely structured filter material (which does not tend to clog) is used at least on the crude gas side. \n\nAmmonia is also degraded in biofilters, but the possible cross-media effects need to be taken into account. This aspect, together with the unknown decline of the performance over time, makes the ammonia removal efficiency of biofilters controversial. \n\nCross-media effects\nThe system involves an extra pressure drop of roughly 30-150 Pa , which depends on the filter surface load, the type and height of the filter material and its age. Ventilating fans must be able to overcome the added resistance; therefore, additional energy consumption is required for ventilation. The water consumed for moistening the substrate is reported to be in the range of 5-7 litres per 1 000 m3 of exhaust air.\n\nThe system is not suitable as a sole process for ammonia reduction from exhaust air from livestock houses with a high ammonia load. Due to the separation of ammonia, the microbial activity is influenced and the pH value is significantly lowered (no adjustments are possible), while the formed salts cannot be removed. Finally, secondary trace gases are formed, such as nitrous oxides and N2O, which risk the functionality of the whole system. \n\nIf the bed scrubber filter material consists of peat, a significant emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) would be associated with the peat mining process, while GHG emissions from the farm system itself may become significant due to the potential formation of N2O.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nBiofilters function properly if:\n\nthe pollutants to be treated are water-soluble and biodegradable;\nthe residence time of the exhaust air to be cleaned is long enough that the odorants can be separated and degraded by microorganisms without these components or reaction products accumulating in the biofilter material;\nthe operating conditions guarantee a sufficient supply of oxygen, water and nutrients to the microorganisms at temperatures of 10 degC to 35 degC . \n\nA capacity of 440 m3/h of exhaust air per m2 of filter surface has been reported. Based on this value and knowing the airflow rate that has to be treated, the dimensions for a filter module can be estimated. The thickness of the active filter layer is normally between 0.3 m and 1.4 m, depending on the material (for coarser materials a large bed height is necessary), whereas the residence (contact) time ranges from 4 seconds to 20 seconds depending on the filter height and surface load. Upscaling or downscaling of the treatment capacity, due to the modular design, is possible.\n\nThe sprinkling of the filter with fresh water (approximately 5-7 litres of water/1 000 m3 of outgoing air, achieving a 60-70 % material moisture) is automatically controlled on the basis of the airflow volume. The filter is moistened from the surface by two nozzles per filter module. \n\nThe resource demand for operating a biofilter with a capacity of 255 000 m3/h exhaust air volume, corresponding to an animal house of 3 000 animal places for fattening pigs, is reported in Table   4 .270. About 21 kWh/animal place per year of energy is needed for pressure compensation in the ventilation system. Furthermore, 1.53 m3/animal place per year of water consumption is necessary.\n\n\nTable 4.270:\tAnnual resources demand for the operation of a biofilter, in Germany \n\n\nAs for all air cleaning systems, the odour removal efficiency depends on the crude gas concentration and is reported to be from 84 % to 97 % . The minimum requirement for odour reduction of air cleaning systems applied in Germany is defined as an odour concentration in the clean gas not exceeding 300 ouE/m3 and no typical process odours (e.g. animal house odour) are perceptible in the clean gas. Biofilters achieving a removal efficiency for odour of over 70 % have only been verified in pig housing . \n\nThe dust abatement efficiency is reported to be from 80 % to 100 %  \n. Measurements of the finest dust fraction, PM2.5, indicate an abatement efficiency of 63 % .\n\nIn Germany, the application of biofilters for ammonia reduction is not recommended, but, at the same time, it is acknowledged that a biofilter can also be operated as an ammonia abatement technique under certain conditions (e.g. in combination with a water curtain) and if carefully operated (comparable to the requirements for bioscrubbers) . The ammonia abatement efficiency is reported to be over 70 %  and up to 89 %, but it is not clear whether the removal efficiency can stay high over time due to the secondary effects previously described (see 'Cross-media effects')  \n.\n\nIn order not to undermine the removal capacity of the bed, regular replacement of the biofilter packing is necessary. Pretreating the air in order to remove the main part of the ammonia load before it enters the biofilter minimises the formation of nitrite/nitrate salts and allows a much longer packing lifespan and thus reduces refilling costs . Used biofilter materials are applied to land. No additional waste water is produced.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nBiofilters are mainly used in houses with no bedding material (slurry-based plants). As the filter area requirement is approximately 0.2-0.25 m2 per animal place, a sufficient area must exist outside the facilities to accommodate the filter packages.\n\nThe implementation in existing houses with forced ventilation must be planned with the adaptation of exhaust air ducts and with significant additional requirements for ventilation, making biofilters in practice only applicable where a centralised ventilation system is used.\n\nEconomics\nData are given for a capacity of 255 000 m3/h exhaust air volume, equivalent to 3 000 fattening pig places. A total annual cost of between EUR 11.60/ap and EUR 13.10/ap results from the amortisation (20 years for construction and 4 % interest rate) of the investment requirements (EUR 59-64/ap, annualised investment costs from EUR 6.5/ap to EUR 6.8/ap) added to annual operating costs of EUR 5.10-6.30 per animal place.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLocal high emission loads or insufficient spatial distances from odour-sensitive receptors are drivers. \n\nExample plants\nAt least 267 German farms are using this technique . \n\nReference literature \n    \n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3421619_abstract", "x": 0.6832804, "y": 0.36177632, "title": "ASPIRATION COVER OF CONVERTER DUST CAP", "year": 2019, "text": "The invention relates to metallurgy and more particularly to fume and dust extraction devices.

In ore preparation, dust emissions are best controlled using high integrity bag filters with appropriate filter cloth material and a maintenance routine to minimise dust emissions.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nLess energy required for drying (and grinding) the titanium ore delivered with a low moisture content and, therefore, less CO2, SOX and NOX emissions, that would otherwise result from the generation of an additional amount of energy required for drying more humid ore.\n\nCross-media effects\nIncreased amounts of dust may be expected when the titaniferous ore is handled in a dry state.\n\nOperational data\nThe ore (ilmenite, titanium slag) is dried to a humidity content of <0.1 % [42, UBA-Germany, 2001]. Dust and NOX emission levels are as presented in Section 3.3.3.3.1. Specific emissions of dust to air are in the range of 0.0002 to 0.08 kg/t TiO2 [20, CEFIC-TDMA, 2004], the maximum emissions of dust to air being reported at the level of 4 kg/t TiO2 [42, UBA-Germany, 2001]. Specific emissions of NOX to air are in the range of 0.002 to 0.04 kg/t TiO2 [20, CEFIC-TDMA, 2004].\n\nApplicability\nThis technique is applicable to all TiO2 plants using the sulphate process route.\n\nEconomics\nNo data submitted.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduced emissions from drying.

These include factors such as feedstock type, feedstock blend, grade mix, total production requirements, water addition, efficiency of chlorine abatement, etc. For environmental and commercial reasons, it is important to recover as much hydrogen chloride as possible. \n\nWith variable off-gas conditions and volumes, today's technology applies aqueous absorption of the hydrochloric acid from the off-gas. An advantage of this process is that the off-gas consists largely of gases that are only slightly soluble in water except for hydrogen chloride, which is to be removed. Using this technology, recovery efficiencies of 99.5 - 99.9 % are predicted. \n\nIn theory, under ideal conditions, 99.99 % recovery should be achievable whilst minimising the build up of water in the system. However, in practice, plants operate under constantly changing conditions because of the need to vary loads, feedstock and the grade of silica being manufactured. This results in fluctuations in the absorption system and consequently practical HCl recovery efficiencies are of the order of 97 %.\n\nBoth countercurrent and cocurrent process systems are used by the industry. In theory, cocurrent systems should be more efficient as the streams should come to equilibrium quicker. However, in practice, due to the quantity of inert gases in the process, neither configuration is preferable as it is the rate of diffusion through the inert gases that controls the absorption rate. Because of this, both process systems achieve comparable recoveries.\n\nAbsorption equipment is very prone to fouling, so the first step in the recovery process is usually the removal of any carryover silica, which has a particle size range of 0.5 - 10 microns in aqueous dispersion, by either venturi scrubber or filtration. It is important to remove these particles because the absorption of hydrogen chloride in water generates approximately 1900 kJ/kg HCl (1.9  3.8 GJ/tonne of silica) of heat that must be removed from the system in order to keep the recovery efficiencies high. Significant silica carryover would foul heat exchangers and block the absorption equipment.\n\nIt is desirable and most efficient to produce hydrochloric acid that is as concentrated as possible to minimise processing, handling and transport costs. In practice, this is about 32 % HCl because this is about the strongest hydrochloric acid that is stable at ambient temperatures. In order to obtain acid of this strength, a minimum of two absorption stages are normally required. Single pass processes generally start with water, this usually being the case if aqueous hydrochloric acid is being exported from the process and used in another operation or sold to external consumers. Alternatively, recycled acid at about 20 % is used if anhydrous hydrochloric acid is to be generated. The strength of the acid is not taken much lower than this during the production of anhydrous hydrochloric acid because the nearer the acid concentration approaches to the azeotropic strength of 20 %, the harder it becomes to strip-off hydrochloric gas. The heat that is liberated in the recovery process must be removed in order to achieve acceptable recovery efficiencies. An effective way to do this, is to make the second stage an adiabatic absorption step. This minimises the number of heat exchangers required in total, as the heat generated here is used to evaporate the water out of the system that is introduced from the off-gas. Various types of absorption equipment can be utilised for the first stage, such as spray towers, packed towers, and falling film exchangers.\n\nTypically, after the off-gas has been through a two stage absorption process, it will still contain up to 150 mg/m3 hydrochloric acid. These residual levels of hydrochloric acid are usually recovered by passing the off-gas through either a final absorption column, venturi scrubber or jet washer, depending upon the maximum residual hydrochloric acid that is acceptable in the off-gas. The weak acid solution containing 1 - 2 % hydrochloric acid, that is generated by this recovery process, is then used as a feed stream into the main absorption process.\n\nAfter the completion of the individual absorption steps virtually all of the hydrochloric acid will have been recovered leaving <10 mg/m3 of HCl in the off-gas from the process.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSubstantial removal of hydrogen chloride from the off-gas released to the atmosphere.\n\nCross-media effects\nNo data submitted.\n\nOperational data\nThe process off-gas contains between 10 - 20 % hydrogen chloride.

In some cases, where sulphite production is undertaken in facilities which are part of a much larger chemical industrial complex, sulphur dioxide generated at the site in other chemical processes can be used. Making sulphur dioxide at the site of sodium sulphite production, creates a low inventory/low pressure regime, but with the added complication of the manufacturing process and the disadvantages of requiring large equipment and producing large vent flows. It can, however, provide a net input of energy.\n\nAbatement\nThe key driver in improving environmental performance is the successful retention of sulphur (as sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide) in the process by good design and operation of the abatement systems. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nProper design and operation of both the 'sulphites' plant and the abatement systems, results in the minimisation of discharges of sulphur compounds (SO2 and H2S) to the atmosphere. The released sulphur compounds are recycled back into the process.\nIn chemical industrial complexes where sulphite production is integrated with other chemical plants, process emissions from the sulphite production can be recycled into other chemical manufacturing processes.\n\nCross-media effects\nPurchasing sulphur dioxide in a liquefied form creates a more significant inventory hazard, but if designed, managed and operated properly tends to lead to lower emissions to air.\n\nOperational data\nRefer to Section 7.16.2 and Figure   7 .110 above. Detailed data on emission levels are included in Section 7.16.3. In particular, specific emissions from the sulphite reactions step should not exceed 2 kg SO2 per tonne of 'sulphites' produced [61, Entec UK Limited, 2004]. \n\nReactions of sulphur dioxide with alkaline solutions are quite rapid and most material will be reacted at this stage. Manufactured sulphur dioxide carried in an air stream, will tend to bypass primary reactions more than when using the pure gas, where reactions can mainly be undertaken in closed vessels.\n\nBoth sulphur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide are highly reactive species where very high absorption efficiencies are possible using alkaline washing, which allows the sulphur compounds to be recycled back into the process. Pressurised discharges through vent pipes, or collection by negative pressure duct systems from low pressure equipment, are both used to direct vented gas to abatement equipment.

Apart from the emission of combustion products, furnace emissions also contain dust and traces of chlorides and fluorides that were present in the raw materials (soda ash and sand).\n\nIn some cases, of particular importance here is the content of the fluoride ions (F-) in sand used for the production of sodium silicate (e.g. when a dolomite deposit is neighbouring a sand quarry) and, hence, the primary measure to be applied, is to use low fluoride sand. Also, following customer requests, specific solid water glass formulations may require the use of sand containing fluoride, and then there will be emissions of hydrogen fluoride. The addition of cullet may have an opposing influence on the emissions of hydrogen fluoride, as from one side, cullet may contain a high content of fluoride, and from the other, the addition of cullet would lower the melting temperature and the volatilisation of the fluorides. \n\nTo keep the emissions of hydrogen fluoride in the outlet gas at a low level, raw materials low in fluoride should be used for the production of sodium silicate, combined with the dry acid scrubbing. The dry acid scrubbing, which - if necessary - may also be applied as a secondary end-of-pipe measure in the abatement of the emissions of SO2 and HCl (see Sections 7.8.4.2 and 7.8.4.4 above), consists in the dispersion of the reactive material (the absorbent) in the waste gas stream.

Therefore, particularly in glass wool processes, the build-up of resinous material in the ducting represents a risk of fire and even explosion. The water sprayed into the gas has a substantial cooling effect and some substances are condensed from the waste gas. This does not necessarily mean the substances are removed and in the early parts of the system, material will be volatilised from the dirty process water. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nDue to the low pressure drop in the system, the removal efficiency for fine particulate matter is quite low; however, the use of impact jets and cyclones promotes condensation of some substances, preventing the build-up of residues in the ducting and the risk of fire, with consequent atmospheric emissions. As in the forming area, the system is a dynamic equilibrium and gaseous emissions are heavily dependent on the process water and binder chemistries.\n\nCross-media effects\nUnless another technique is used to remove entrained water (e.g. packed bed, cyclone, demister), this technique can lead to high water consumption and emissions of mists. \n\nOperational data \nThe emission levels that are achieved using this technique are given in Table   4 .121.\n\nApplicability\nAs for the forming area, in principle, this technique is applicable to all mineral wool processes. It is not used in many stone wool plants because it is not deemed necessary for process cleaning, and could adversely affect the performance of other techniques. Impact jets and cyclones are extensively applied for curing ovens in approximately 90 % of glass wool plants, often for combined forming and curing flue-gases. The technique is used as a pretreatment in conjunction with other techniques.\n\n\nEconomics\nCosts for this technique are given in Table   4 .122 and depend largely on airflow and plant size. The issues relating to how much of the cost can be considered as an abatement cost are the same as for the forming area.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nParticularly in glass wool processes, the build-up of resinous material in the ducting represents a risk of fire and even explosion. The water sprayed into the gas has a substantial cooling effect and some substances are condensed from the waste gas.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique is so widely applied that it is not useful to specify example plants.\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3156375_abstract", "x": 0.518554, "y": 0.45178786, "title": "METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING MOLTEN GLASS, METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING GLASS PRODUCT, AND DEVICE FOR MANUFACTURING MOLTEN GLASS", "year": 2017, "text": "There is provided a process for producing molten glass, which is capable of easily increasing the H2O content in glass melt with excessive generation of convention of the glass melt being reduced.One mode of the process for producing molten glass according to the present invention is characterized to include a material melting step for melting a raw glass material in a melting furnace to prepare glass melt; a water-molecules supply step for supplying a water-molecules supply gas into the glass melt flowing from an upstream end of the melting furnace toward a downstream end of the melting furnace; and a refining step for degassing, under a reduced pressure atmosphere, the glass melt flowing out of the downstream end; wherein a position where the water-molecules supply gas is supplied in the water-molecules supply step includes a first position and a second position from downstream to upstream in a flowing direction of the glass melt in this order; the first position is a position away from both of the upstream end and the downstream end; and the second position is a position closer to the upstream end than a center of a distance between the upstream end and the first position in the flowing direction of the glass melt.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.4.2.4\" title=\"The FENIX process\">\n<references_to>4.4.2.1</references_to>\n\n<content>\nThe FENIX process\n\nDescription\nThe FENIX process is based on the combination of a number of primary measures for the optimisation of combustion of cross-fired regenerative float furnaces and the reduction of energy consumption. In common with the combustion modification techniques described in Section 4.4.2.1, the optimisation of combustion for FENIX relates to:\n\nthe reduction of excess air;\nthe suppression of hotspots thanks to the homogenisation of flame temperatures; and a controlled mixing of the fuel and combustion air, without giving rise to glass quality problems or carbon monoxide emissions.\n\nThe FENIX process also involves a complete modification of the combustion system and particularly the use of a new type of injector. These injectors are under patent registration and are different depending on the type of energy used (gas, heavy oil or mixed energy) and are associated with new furnace designs including:\n\noverall dimensions (length, width, depth of glass), also depending on the pull rate\ndesign of burner ports\nregenerators (separate chambers).\nThe technology can be implemented on furnaces using gas, heavy oil, or the mixing of the two energies. Combustion control is provided by:\n\nminimising excess air through a reduction of the air for atomisation of fuel oil, special designs of socket plates, elimination of cold air entrances and maintenance of furnaces;\nreducing the fuel/air mixing rate in particular through the optimisation of the number, the types and the positions (angles) of injectors in the port.\n\nThe technique also includes a review of the furnace control system and the installation of monitoring methods for certain furnace parameters. In particular, oxygen probes are installed at the top of the regenerator chambers to provide better control of excess air levels.\n\nThe main characteristics of the FENIX technique are described in the patent application  and the evolutions since 1998 are under patent registration.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe FENIX process allows the continuous stabilisation of NOX emissions of between 700 and 800 mg/Nm3. For example, NOX emissions of the Stolberg plant, that runs a cross-fired float glass furnace (see Figure   4 .36 below) have been stabilised below 800 mg/Nm3 since February 2005, which correspond to a specific emission coefficient of less than 1.7 kg of NOX per tonne of molten glass.\n\n\nFigure 4.36:\tNOX emissions from the FENIX process\n\n\nCross-media effects \nAt the time of writing this document (2010), the cross-media effects had not been evaluated.\n\nOperational data\nAs reported in the Glass BREF adopted in 2001, the first trial in the Aniche plant (France), at that time running with fuel oil, had been carried out following the modifications to the combustion system as described in the patent application  and had shown a performance of 510 - 580 mg/Nm3 (1.25 kg of NOX/tonne of molten glass) during a short period of tests. This furnace is now (2010) operating with 60 % gas and 40 % heavy oil and the NOX emissions have been stabilised consistently at a higher value than the one that was reached during tests, and are in the range of 700 - 800 mg/Nm3. \n\nIn the meantime, the Fenix process had also been applied to other furnaces with the same range of emissions (between 700 and 800 mg/Nm3) being achieved. \n\nApplicability\nThe FENIX process requires careful application by a specialised team. It has been fully developed on at least nine furnaces of Saint-Gobain Glass in Europe. The technique can be available for float processes when directly integrated during the design and construction of the furnace. \n\nSaint-Gobain Glass stated in 2001 that they were ready to grant a non-exclusive licence under the FENIX technology to other glassmakers, provided that an agreement could be reached on the conditions of such a licence. However, the application of this technique requires a previous study of the furnace to be carried out by the supplier; this necessity could make the application to other glassmakers very difficult because of confidentiality issues. \nAt the time of writing this document (2010), this technique has only been applied to cross-fired regenerative furnaces and, due to its specificities, it is improbable that it could be extended to other furnace technologies. \n\nThe trends of the first results obtained in the Aniche plant that had been reported inside the Glass BREF of 2001 were reproduced on other furnaces, using other fuels, allowing for the conclusion that the NOX emission ranges of 700 - 800 mg/Nm3 could be stabilised consistently. \n\nEconomics \nThe capital costs, including the furnace modifications (upper cost of refractories), the new burners and the improved control systems amount to approximately EUR 1.5 million for the application to an existing furnace operating with at least part of the energy supply as fuel oil. For a new plant or rebuild, the extra costs would be lower, at around EUR 1 million.

For this reason it is important to consider all the primary techniques described in this document as a package rather than simply as individual techniques. However, for clarity, the techniques have necessarily been described separately, but consequential effects have been discussed where possible. A low level of emissions from material carryover is achieved by maintaining a level of moisture in the raw materials and by controlling the batch blanket coverage, particle size, gas velocity and burner positioning. For those processes which require dry batch materials, and/or very fine batch materials, dust emissions from carryover may be slightly higher. \n\nHowever, the contribution to the overall emissions will still be minor compared to the volatile species contribution. Issues relating to dust arising from material charging are dealt with in Section 4.3 above.\n\nBecause the dust emissions arise mainly from volatile species, the primary abatement techniques discussed here concentrate on this source. From dust analyses of soda-lime furnaces, it can be concluded that sodium species are the major components leading to dust formation in flue-gases. Volatile species from the batch (e.g. NaCl) and from the melt (e.g. NaOH) react with sulphur oxides to form sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) which condenses in the waste gas below 1100 degC. In most cases, sodium sulphate is used as the fining agent. The dissociation of the sodium sulphate in the molten glass leads to sulphur oxide concentrations, which are much higher than the sodium component concentrations in the combustion chamber and in the flue-gases. With respect to Na2SO4 formation, the oxides of sulphur from fuel combustion or batch sulphate are available in stoichiometric excess compared to the volatilised sodium, which is the governing parameter for dust formation. The main sources of sodium are the cullet or soda ash and, to a minor extent, sodium sulphate. However, the use of high amounts of sodium sulphate in the batch composition causes an increase in dust emissions.\n\nIn very sulphur-lean gases, sodium chloride, sodium fluoride, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide particles can be formed during the cooling of the flue-gases to below 900 degC. This is not common, and can only occur when natural gas is used and when sodium sulphate is replaced by another fining agent, like antimony. This is never the case for container or flat glass but could happen in special applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of different volatilisation processes can be distinguished in soda-lime glass.\n\nReactive volatilisation from the molten glass surface. The sodium oxide (Na2O) in the silicate melt reacts at the surface with water vapour: Na2O (melt) + H2O - 2 NaOH (g). This type of volatilisation may be the major source of dust emissions in soda-lime glass furnaces.\nVolatilisation of the NaCl present as an impurity in synthetic soda. This volatilisation leads not only to sodium sulphate dust but also to HCl formation. \nVolatilisation of sodium sulphate from the surface of molten glass.\nReactive volatilisation by chemical reactions at the batch blanket surface with components in the furnace atmosphere. The water vapour in the combustion chamber is thought to be important for the reaction of soda ash to form sodium hydroxide vapours, with similar reactions for potassium compounds: Na2CO3 + H2O - 2NaOH(g) + CO2.\nVolatilisation of raw material components from the surface of the batch blanket (e.g. sand, feldspars, lime, soda ash, dolomite and sodium sulphate) is generally very low. Vapour pressures are very low below 1200 degC, and above 1000 degC; the single components have already reacted to form silicates.\nVolatilisation of sodium compounds in gas bubbles during the fining process is also of relatively minor importance.\nIn the case of the recycling of external cullet (container glass furnaces), emissions of lead components (PbO, PbCO3, PbSO4) might take place because of lead glass, mirror fragments and metallic lead contaminants in the cullet. This is not the case of soda-lime glass in the domestic sector where, in general, only internal cullet is used due to quality demands. In these cases, the level of cullet used in the batch formulation is process-dependent and can be limited. \n\nThe situation is different for other glass types. As already explained in Section 4.4.1, for boron glasses containing low alkali, reactive volatilisation is thought to be the main source of particulate matter. The composition of emitted dust varies significantly depending on the alkali content of the batch formulation and the fining agent. \n\nDust formation by volatilisation occurs very readily for glasses which contain boron and the concentration of unabated emissions is generally higher than for soda-lime glasses. In some cases they are more than ten times higher.\n\nThe types of volatilisation mechanisms described for soda-lime glass are the general basis of volatilisation in most other glasses, but clearly there is variation depending on the chemistry.\n\nThe most important factors affecting volatilisation are temperature, water vapour content in the furnace atmosphere, reducing gases just above the melt or batch blanket and the velocities of the gases at the surface of the melt. The availability of reactive species is also an important factor, particularly sodium and sulphates in soda-lime glass, and boron in boron glasses. However, this factor is often limited by the glass chemistry. \n\nA particular situation occurs when oxy-fuel combustion is applied for the melting process. The reduced flue-gas volume with lower flue-gas velocities and the significantly different composition of the combustion gases in contact with the glass melt (much higher concentration of water vapour and CO2) affect the volatilisation processes resulting, in general, in higher concentrations of the evaporated species and more aggressive furnace atmospheres; however, total dust emissions in terms of kg/tonne glass will often decrease, although this effect strongly depends on the furnace design, type and positioning of the burners.\n\nThe most important primary measures that can be taken to reduce dust emissions are outlined below.\n\nRaw material modifications\nSodium chloride can be a significant factor in emissions of dust and chlorides. It is used in some special glasses as a refining agent, but is more commonly present as a low level impurity in soda ash made by the Solvay process. Pressure from the glass industry has led soda ash producers to lower NaCl levels significantly (now generally around 1 kg/tonne). A further significant reduction in the short term would probably require further processing and therefore an increase in price. Natural soda ash is available which is virtually NaCl-free, but this material is generally more expensive in the European Union (EU) due to taxes and transport costs from the countries of origin. The main supply of natural soda ash comes from the US.\n\nIn most furnaces, the batch sulphate levels have been reduced to the minimum commensurate with good fining and maintaining the correct oxidation state of the glass. Alternatives to sodium sulphate can pose a greater environmental problem, e.g. arsenic and antimony-based fining agents. Further progress in this area is not expected to yield substantial emissions reductions. The limiting factor is thought to be the concentration of the sodium-containing vapours, but for gas-fired furnaces, very reduced sulphate concentrations would limit the reaction in the gas phase.\nIn glasses containing boron, the boron is essential to the forming of the products and the product characteristics. In recent years, substantial reductions have been made in boron levels, but further progress is becoming difficult without affecting the productivity, energy consumption and quality. Boron-containing materials are relatively expensive and every effort is made to reduce consumption. At the time of writing no credible alternatives to boron are available and the difficulties have led many operators to install secondary abatement techniques, particularly for glass wool and borosilicate furnaces. In general, abated dusts are recycled to the furnace.\n\nA number of companies in the continuous filament glass fibre sector have developed glass compositions that have low levels of boron and fluorine or only contain these elements due to trace levels in the raw materials. Emissions of particulate matter below 0.14 kg/tonne melted glass have been reported, to be compared with values of around 2 kg/tonne melted glass for formulations containing boron where no primary measures are applied, which demonstrate the importance of boron in the dust formation. This type of glass requires a higher melting temperature, is more difficult to fiberise, and the long-term effects on refractory life have yet to be determined. The details of the technique are proprietary, and therefore, although extremely promising, the technique cannot yet be considered as generally available. Progress varies between the different companies, but several of these formulations are now marketable.\n\nTemperature reduction at the melt surface\nThe surface temperature of the glass melt is an important factor in particulate formation, as more volatile species are generated at higher temperatures. A correlation between crown temperature, the glass melt surface temperature and particulate formation has been shown in soda-lime furnaces. Reduction of furnace temperature must be balanced with glass quality, the productivity of the furnace, and other environmental aspects such as the NOX concentration in the flue-gas. Measures which have the greatest effect in reducing dust emissions per tonne of glass are those which improve the energy efficiency and particularly the heat transfer to the glass. The main points are given below.\n\nFurnace design and geometry to improve convective currents and heat transfer. These modifications can only be implemented at the furnace rebuild. Larger furnaces are generally more energy efficient also resulting in lower emissions per tonne of glass.\nUse of electric boost which helps to reduce the crown temperature by putting energy directly into the melt and improving convective currents. The positioning of the electrodes is important, but this is difficult to change except at the furnace rebuild. The use of electric boost is usually limited by the cost of electricity.\nThe increased use of cullet which will reduce the melting energy requirement allowing operation at a lower temperature and lower fuel usage. Also, because cullet has already been melted its use helps to reduce the level of some of the volatile and reactive species, which contribute to dust formation, e.g. sodium chloride and batch sulphates. This is particularly relevant in oil or mixed oil/gas-fired furnaces where a reduction in the fuel requirement, due to the use of cullet, reduces SO2 levels. Cullet usage is limited by the availability of cullet at the correct quality, composition and affordability. For example, container glass furnaces use 5 - 95 % cullet (internal and external), soda-lime domestic glass and flat glass furnaces generally 10 - 40 % (usually only internal), and continuous filament glass fibre furnaces rarely use any cullet. \n\nBurner positioning\nAnother important factor in the rate of volatilisation from the melt is the rate of replacement of the gases above the melt. A high gas velocity or a high level of turbulence at the surface of the melt will increase the rate of volatilisation. Progress has been made with burner positioning to optimise combustion air velocity and direction, and fuel velocity and direction. Further work has also been carried out involving combining these changes with modifications to the furnace, with the aim of reducing the flue-gas velocity over the glass melt and batch blanket, with a reduced stripping effect on volatile components of the batch formulation. Changes that involve modifications to furnace design can only be implemented at furnace rebuild, and other changes are sometimes most effective when implemented with furnace redesign. When changing the positioning of the burners, it is important to avoid reducing flames touching the melt, since this would increase dust emissions and would promote refractory attack in the superstructure, with possible effects on the glass quality.\n\nConversion to gas firing (or very low sulphur oils)\nConversion from fuel oil firing to natural gas firing may give substantial reductions in dust emissions. The reasons for this are probably the particular condensation reactions for particulates with gas firing than with oil, although in some cases the reduced SOX levels might also be a factor. \n\nFor example, the flat glass sector has reported dust emission reductions in excess of 25 % for the conversion from oil to gas firing. The flat glass sector has also reported a significant effect from reducing the sulphur content of the oil (20 mg/Nm3 reduction in dust per 1 % reduction in oil sulphur content). A similar effect was observed in domestic glass with low sulphur oil (<1 %). Conversion to natural gas firing is discussed in more detail in Section 4.4.3.1. The main points are summarised below:\n\nthe majority of plants are already equipped to use either fuel, although some may not have access to a natural gas or a fuel oil supply;\ncosts of the technique will depend mainly on the prevailing fuel prices;\nthe lower emissivity of gas flame compared to fuel oil flames reduces the heat transfer to the melt and may increase energy consumption; \nnatural gas firing can result in higher NOX emissions compared with oil firing;\nsome cases of mixed combustion, using both types of fuels simultaneously in one furnace may enable reduced dust emissions without notably increasing the furnace energy consumption and NOX emissions.\n\nOther techniques\nEmissions from cold top electric furnaces can be minimised by reducing airflows and turbulence during charging, and by raw material grain size and moisture optimisation. Primary measures are rarely implemented for dust emissions from stone wool cupolas with the exception of the briquetting of the production waste added into the batch formulation. The main action that could be taken would be washing the raw materials to remove dust. However, most cupolas are fitted with bag filters and so there is little incentive to apply additional primary measures, because they are very unlikely to change the need for secondary measures.\n\nThe main advantages and disadvantages of primary techniques for the reduction of dust emissions are shown in Table   4 .86.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.86:\tMain advantages and disadvantages of primary techniques for dust reduction\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe emission levels achievable using primary techniques alone are difficult to quantify, because of the wide range of factors that can affect the results and the wide variation in furnace types and glass formulations.\n\nFor flame-fired furnaces, the lowest emission levels, using only primary abatement techniques, are achieved by furnaces producing soda-lime glasses. Average mass emissions are around 0.4 kg/tonne of glass melted, and the majority of the emission concentrations fall into the range of 100 - 300 mg/Nm3. There are some furnaces achieving less than 100 mg/Nm3 for dust, but these are not common. \n\nAt the time of writing, few plants have dust emission levels of below 100 mg/Nm3 without secondary abatement, and 100 - 200 mg/Nm3 (<=0.4 kg/tonne of glass) is considered currently achievable with primary measures. \n\nIt is unlikely that these figures could be achieved for compositions other than soda-lime glass. In general, for other compositions the optimisation of primary techniques could be expected to reduce emissions by 10 - 30 % of the starting value associated with a condition when no specific measures are applied to limit dust emissions.\n\nPrimary measures combined with secondary measures (filtering systems, wet scrubbers) reduce the amount of dust to be removed from the flue-gases and to be recycled or disposed of.\n\nCross-media effects\nIn general, the techniques described prevent emissions without using additional chemicals/substances so the cross-media effects are assumed to be positive. However, a modification of the raw materials used for the preparation of the batch composition, with the scope of reducing volatile components, could result in an increase of specific energy consumption. For instance, the addition of water to the batch composition to suppress carryover or the substitution of a raw material with one less volatile but requiring a higher melting temperature normally results in an increase of energy consumption. A temperature reduction at melt surface might affect the quality of glass, leading to higher rates of rejected finished articles and higher specific energy consumption per unit of saleable product. A different positioning of the burners applied to minimise volatilisation phenomena might cause a decrease in the energy efficiency of the furnace with a consequent increase of specific emissions from combustion; in addition, a modification of the evaporation/condensation phenomena of the deposited salts may occur with potential damage to the refractories exposed to the flue-gas.\n\nThe conversion from fuel oil firing to natural gas firing is normally associated with an increase of NOx emissions and specific energy consumptions. \n\n\n\nOperational data\nIncluded in the descriptions.\n\nApplicability\nThe techniques described are considered to be generally applicable to all parts of the industry within the constraints identified. However, techniques successfully implemented in one furnace may not have the same effects for other furnaces. The reduction achieved will depend on the starting level of dust emissions. Moreover, the introduction of more than one of the techniques presented in this section will not necessarily provide a cumulative level of reduction.\n\nIn the short to medium term, primary measures for dust abatement are likely to achieve more significant reductions for soda-lime formulations than for other glass types. An exception may be represented by the continuous filament glass fibre produced with low or boron-free formulations.\n\nEconomics\nVery little information is available on the costs of primary techniques, but the industry has reported that the costs of the measures implemented to date (2010) are considered to be low. Indeed those techniques that reduce energy usage may result in cost savings. \n\nPrimary measures can involve varying costs depending on the level and time scale of the application. The measures are an overall package and it is the optimisation of the package that determines the costs and results. For example, the use of low chloride or natural soda ash is unlikely to reduce dust emissions to levels comparable to secondary abatement, and depending on other factors the costs may be disproportionate to the benefits. However, it is one aspect of the package of measures, the costs and results of which, must be considered as a whole.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe implementation of primary measures for the reduction of dust emissions is often based on economic and operational benefits deriving from the application of the selected techniques, such as avoiding the clogging of regenerators, corrosion or damage of the materials, reducing volatilisation and the consequent loss of valuable raw materials, etc. \n\nExample plants\nThe application of some of the primary techniques described in this section is common within the glass industry.\n\nReference literature   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3293229_abstract", "x": 0.47403407, "y": 0.3296943, "title": "ADDITIVES TO IMPROVE OPEN-TIME AND FREEZE-THAW CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER-BASED PAINTS AND COATINGS", "year": 2018, "text": "Waterborne coatings are described having an acceptable balance of properties both during the storage of coating, application and drying.

An important aspect of this is the selection of coating materials with low levels of organic solvents. However, some volatile species will be present either as solvents or as by-products of the reactions. The coating materials used vary widely between products and installations, but material selection is the most effective method of reducing emissions. The high volumes of air necessary to cool the glass make it very difficult and expensive to control Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions by secondary measures.\n\nThe high airflows result in some carryover of droplets and encourage volatilisation of any VOCs present. Wet scrubbing systems are often used to control the waste gas but the effect on volatile substances will be limited to condensation. Wet electrostatic precipitators could also be used in this application but no examples of this are known. Costs of wet scrubbing and wet electrostatic precipitators will be similar to those quoted for the mineral wool sector. The emission levels achieved will depend entirely on the case-specific starting levels; some typical figures are given in Section 3.5.2.3. \n\nThe wet cakes are usually dried in ovens and any species volatile at these temperatures will be emitted with the water vapour. In general, the molecular weights of the materials are quite high and a significant proportion of any volatile substances will have been emitted during the coating application.

The waste gas volumes are quite small and standard control techniques could be used if significant releases were identified, for example, incineration, adsorption, and scrubbing.

However, it will always be preferable to control such emissions by optimisation of the coating formulation before any abatement techniques are installed.\n\nDust emissions arising from cutting and milling can be readily treated by extraction to a filter system. This is the standard technique used throughout the sector and emissions in the range of 1 - 5 mg/Nm3 can be achieved.\n\nSecondary processing can involve the use of further coating or binder materials.

Electric melting has important effects on pollutant emissions and so is also discussed in this chapter as a 'primary' abatement measure.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe complete replacement of fossil fuels in the furnace eliminates the formation of combustion products at the installation level (but electricity generation should be accounted for); namely, oxides of sulphur (when fuel oil is used), thermal NOX, and carbon dioxide (CO2) The remaining emissions arise from particulate carryover and the decomposition of batch materials, particularly CO2 from carbonates, NOX from nitrates and SOX from sulphates. In most cases where electric melting is applied, sulphate use in the batch composition is quite low, since the use of other refining and oxidising agents is more common (e.g. nitrates).\n\nThere may also be low levels of halide emissions, e.g. hydrogen fluoride (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)), or metals where these substances are present in the raw materials. However, emissions can be significant from formulations with added fluorides. The emissions of all volatile batch components are considerably lower than in conventional furnaces due to the reduced gas flow and the absorption, condensation and reaction of gaseous emissions in the batch blanket which usually covers the whole surface of the melt.\n\nThe furnaces are usually open on one side and there are significant air currents due to the gaseous emissions and the heat from the melt. It is usually necessary to provide some form of ventilation to allow dust, gases and heat to escape without entering the work place. This is achieved either by natural draught or by extraction. The waste gas emitted by natural draft will have a very low volume but may have a high dust concentration, and poor dispersion characteristics.\nDust emissions can be controlled by extraction to a dust abatement system, which due to the low volumes involved is usually a bag filter. This arrangement results in very low dust emissions and also allows for the treatment of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions by dry scrubbing if necessary. See Sections 4.4.1.3 and 4.4.3.\n\nThe actual emissions achieved will depend greatly on the batch formulation, and due to the low waste gas flows, a comparison of emission concentrations can be misleading. However, as a broad indication, overall direct emissions are reduced by a factor of between 10 and 100 compared to a conventional air-fuel-fired furnace of comparable pull rate. Some actual quantitative data are given in Section 3.8.2.2 for mineral wool installations, and in the example installations presented in this document. \n\nCross-media effects\nDirect emissions from the furnace are greatly reduced using electric melting and the thermal efficiency is very high. However, when considering the overall environmental performance of the technique, the environmental impact of power generation can offset most of the advantages. A full quantitative analysis is impossible within the scope of this document. The environmental issues associated with electricity generation are very complex, and differ widely across the European Union (EU) and sometimes between installations. \n\nElectricity can be supplied from the national supply or from a local or dedicated supply, which can affect both the cost and the efficiency of supply. If the power is taken from the national grid network, it can be from a wide variety of sources. Power generation from coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro and other renewable sources all have very different environmental issues associated with them. \n\nThe difference in thermal efficiency between electric melting and fossil fuel melting is also reduced when the efficiency of electricity generation is considered (primary energy). \n\nAgain it depends very much on the source of electricity, but for a traditional fossil fuel-fired power plant, the efficiency from primary fuel to point of electricity use is in the region of 30 - 35 %. For a combined cycle natural gas turbine plant, the figure would be closer to 50 %.\n\nIndirect emissions of CO2 and NOXx associated with the production of electric energy have been estimated for a small furnace producing 20 tonnes/day of non-lead crystal glass. In this particular case, the reduction of 14 tonnes/year of NOX emissions, achieved by switching from a fossil fuel-fired furnace to electric melting furnace, is completely offset by the amount of indirect emissions accounted for in the production of electricity, equivalent to 15 - 16 tonnes NOX/year and 6 300 tonnes/year of indirect CO2 emissions. This is not always the case; for lead crystal glass furnaces, the net NOX and CO2 emissions (indirect + direct emissions) are slightly lower for the electric furnace than for the fossil fuel-fired one, but the difference between the two is rather small.  \n\nDue to the low waste gas volumes associated with the technique, the cost of any downstream abatement equipment is greatly reduced and the low volumes of collected dust can be readily recycled. The low volatile loss also reduces the consumption of raw materials, which reduces both emissions and costs. This is particularly beneficial for some of the more expensive and/or toxic components such as lead oxides, fluorides, arsenic compounds, borax, etc. \n\nOperational data\nIn general, electric melting produces a very homogenous high quality glass, in particular, in the case of special glasses in which batch formulations contain volatile components. For some domestic and special glass applications, this can be one of the primary reasons for choosing electric melting.\n\n\nHowever, cold-top electric furnaces have a smaller operating tonnage 'window' than conventional furnaces. For example, a 40 tonnes/day cold-top electric furnace would typically operate well between 36 - 44 tonnes/day. When a lower tonnage is required for a specific machine production rate, the electric furnaces are difficult to control, and the higher pull must be maintained (side drain); therefore, more glass is being melted than the required amount for production needs, resulting in higher production costs. On the contrary, a 40 tonnes/day conventional furnace could operate at 25 - 30 tonnes/day, if needed, with very few problems.\n\nThe traditional view within the glass industry is that sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate are required in cold-top electric furnaces to provide the necessary oxidising conditions for a stable, safe and efficient manufacturing process. The use of nitrates directly affects the emissions of NOX and although not necessary for all applications, this can reduce some of the environmental benefits of electric melting. The use of nitrates as oxidising agents becomes more important where waste material which contains organic compounds is recycled to the melter. The use of high external cullet levels (or other recycled materials) can sometimes cause odour problems.\n\nA summary of the main advantages and disadvantages associated with the application of electric melting is shown in Table   4 .83:\n\n\nTable 4.83:\tMain advantages and disadvantages of electric melting\n\n\nAn example installation is presented in Table   4 .84 for the production of domestic glass, particularly crystal and lead crystal.\n\n\nTable 4.84:\tExample installation for the application of electric melting in the domestic glass sector (crystal and lead crystal glass) \n\n\nApplicability\nElectric melting is applicable in many parts of the glass industry and is used in several sectors including high temperature insulation wools, mineral wool, special glass, domestic glass and, to a lesser extent, in container glass generally for low tonnages for the production of flaconnage. Electric melting can clearly only be installed at a furnace rebuild. There are no known full-scale examples of electric melting in the flat glass or frits sectors. The technique is commonly used for the production of potentially highly volatile, polluting glasses (e.g. lead crystal and opal glass) and for high value added products.\n\nThe wider use of the technique is limited by the operating costs and by some technical considerations. As discussed above, the main constraint is the operating cost and, depending on a range of factors, this sets an upper size limit on the economic viability. \n\n\n\nAt the time of writing the document (2010), the technique is not in use for large volume glass production (>300 tonnes per day) and so cannot be considered fully proven either technically or economically. The application of electric melting to the production of continuous filament glass fibre is not considered to be currently economically or technically viable, since E-glass often used for this type of product has a low alkali content resulting in very low electrical conductivity. \n\nAn experimental float glass line with an electrically heated furnace was in operation in the UK from 1989 to 2000. This plant was built to demonstrate the principle of cold top electric melting for float glass production. The plant has operated successfully on this pilot scale and it has been used to produce a range of exotic glasses, the emissions from which would have been very difficult to control from a conventionally-fired furnace. The application demonstrated that operating a full-scale float glass line (>500 tonnes per day) with an all-electric furnace is not currently economically viable due to the high operating costs. The furnace is no longer in operation.\n\nEconomics\nThe economic viability of electric melting depends mainly on the price differential between electricity and fossil fuels. At the time of writing (2010), average electricity costs per unit of energy are 4 to 5 times the cost of fuel oil. Electricity costs can vary by up to 100 % between Member States, but fossil fuel prices tend to show less difference. Fuel prices and their variations are discussed in Section 4.4.3.1. Electric furnaces are very thermally efficient; in general, they are 2 to 4 times better than air-fuel-fired furnaces. The comparison for large, energy efficient furnaces is at the lower end of this range, and for smaller furnaces at the upper end. \n\nElectric furnaces have much lower capital costs than conventional furnaces which, when annualised, partially compensate for the higher operating costs. However, the furnaces have shorter campaign lives before they require rebuild or repair, i.e. 2 to 7 years compared to 10 to 20 years for conventional furnaces. The electric furnace can be more competitive in the range of 10 to 50 tonnes/day, because of the higher specific heat losses of air-fuel furnaces.\n\nGeneral conclusions on the costs of electric melting versus fossil fuel-fired melting cannot be made; all cost considerations need to be done on a case-specific basis since several parameters need to be taken into account (location, different energy sources and prices, furnace capacity, production flexibility, furnace lifetime, glass quality to be achieved, stability of the process, etc.), in particular when comparing all electric furnaces to regenerative, recuperative and oxy-fired furnaces. \n \nAs an example, the comparison between an all-electric melting furnace of about 30 tonnes/day, in the tableware/crystal glass sector, and a recuperative unit melter furnace shows that the electric furnace requires a higher investment cost of about EUR 3 million, due to its shorter lifetime, but lower operating costs (EUR 350 000 less). In this particular case, slightly lower costs per tonne of molten glass are reported.\nBased on current practice, the following is proposed as a very general indicative guide to the size of electrical furnaces which may be viable, i.e. those which can potentially be a practicable alternative (there are inevitably exceptions due to local circumstances):\n\nFurnaces below 75 tonnes per day are generally viable.\nFurnaces in the range 75 - 150 tonnes per day may be viable in some circumstances.\nFurnaces greater than 150 tonnes per day are generally unlikely to be viable.\n\nThe financial considerations can also be greatly affected by site-specific factors including: prevailing energy costs; product quality requirements, available space, costs of alternative abatement measures, prevailing legislation; ease of operation; and the anticipated operating life of alternative furnaces.\n\nIn those Member States where the price difference between fossil fuels and electricity is at the upper end of the range given, the option of electric melting may appear less attractive. In such cases this could lead the operator to select a combination of other techniques in preference to electric melting.\n\nWhen using electric furnaces, the emissions of CO2 associated with the melting process are low, since they only arise from the batch composition. The related operational costs would hardly be affected by the cost of CO2 emission allowances needed to cover the furnace emissions (European Directives 2003/87/EC and 2009/29/EC establishing an Emissions Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emissions); however, an indirect effect on the cost of electricity, due to the the generator passing on European Union (EU)-Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) costs, should be considered.\n\nWhether or not electric furnaces can be considered more 'carbon' efficient will depend on the source of electricity.\n\nAn example installation, presenting the costs associated with the electric melting technique applied to the production of special, borosilicate glass is given in Table   4 .85.\n\n\nTable 4.85:\tExample installation for the application of electric melting in the special glass sector\n\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe thermal efficiency of an electric furnace is better than the equivalent conventional furnace. Waste gas volumes are very low (only gases from batch decomposition). The use of electricity might be locally favoured, in the framework of a non-carbon-based energy policy.\n\nExample plants\nSchott, Mainz, Germany - Special Glass.\nBritish Gypsum Isover Ltd, Runcorn, UK - Glass Wool.\nSGD, Mers-les-Bains, France - Container Glass (flaconnage)\nBormioli Luigi, Parma, Italy - Domestic Glass\nBormioli Rocco e Figlio, Bergantino, Italy - Container borosilicate glass (flaconnage).\n\nReference literature\n [94, Beerkens - Air Pollution Control (APC) Evaluation 2008]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3689542_abstract", "x": 0.5662667, "y": 0.57509905, "title": "A METHOD FOR GRINDING AND POLISHING GLASS SHEETS", "year": 2020, "text": "A succession (8) of glass sheets (2) is fed in a longitudinal direction (6A) at a predetermined speed and through a grinding station (13), in which a perimeter surface (5) of the glass sheets (2) is first ground by means of one or more grinding wheels (22) and then polished by means of one or more polishing wheels (27); during the grinding and the polishing, the current absorbed by each of the electric motors (23)(28) rotating the wheels (22)(27) is detected, compared with a corresponding predetermined limit value of current that can be absorbed by the electric motor (23)(28) and, when above this, continuing to feed the succession (8) of glass sheets (2) in the longitudinal direction (6A), reducing at least one of either the relative sheet-wheel speed and the thrust action of the polishing wheels (27) against the glass sheet (2) being processed.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.5.4\" title=\"Domestic glass\">\n<referenced_by>3.6.2.3</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nDomestic glass\n\nIn the majority of domestic glass processes, there are no significant emissions to air from the activities downstream of the furnace.

Whilst the basic technology for both of these is similar, the design criteria for particulate or gas removal are very different. However, to keep down capital costs, wet scrubbing systems are often used to control mixed emissions of particulates and gases. The design is inevitably a compromise, but may represent Best Available Techniques (BAT) where separate control systems are prohibitively expensive. Wet scrubbing is a well-documented technique and only the main principles and the issues specific to this sector are discussed here.\n\nParticle collection by liquid scrubbing occurs by three main mechanisms: inertial impaction, interception and diffusion. Trace gas removal by wet scrubbing occurs by absorption and, to a lesser extent, condensation. Absorption involves mass transfer between a soluble gas and a solvent in a gas-liquid contacting device.\n\nThe particle collection efficiency of wet scrubbers is strongly dependent on the total energy usage, particularly on the pressure drop across the collection zone. If the liquid is evenly dispersed within the scrubber, similar pressure drops will often give similar efficiencies on the same dust for quite different scrubber designs. Thus, it is not possible to design a wet scrubber which has high efficiencies on particles of 1 mm and below, and which does not have a high pressure drop. High energy scrubbers can give good collection efficiencies for particles of <0.5 mm, but the high running costs mean that alternative techniques may be more economical.\nThe efficiency of gas absorption depends on the difference between the partial pressure of the soluble gas in the waste gas stream and the vapour pressure of the gas in the liquid, the solubility of the gas in the liquid, the surface area for contact, and, to a lesser extent, the contact time. There will also be a condensation effect, which can be important if the waste gas is warm. Solubility obviously depends on the gas and the liquid. Water is suitable for absorbing soluble acidic gases such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, silicon hexafluoride, and for ammonia. Alkaline or acid solutions are suitable for absorbing less soluble gases, and in some applications, oxidising solutions can control organic odours. The surface area is determined by the packing material or droplet size.\nPacked bed scrubbers consist of an outer shell which contains a bed of packing material on support grids, liquid distributors, gas and liquid inlets and outlets, and a mist eliminator. Liquid is distributed continuously over the packing material forming a film, which provides a large surface area for gas/liquid contact. The dirty gas stream flows through the packed bed and the liquid and gas flow may be countercurrent, concurrent or cross-current. There are various types of packing material, which can be packed in random or regular arrangements. The liquid film over the packing material provides a large surface area for mass transfer. Countercurrent packed bed absorbers maximise the driving force for absorption because gas leaving the packed bed encounters fresh absorbing liquid. Packed beds can become blocked by insoluble particulate matter, scale and biological growth.\n\nIn some applications, venturi scrubbers may be considered. The characteristic feature of a venturi scrubber is the constriction to the duct (venturi throat) causing an increase in gas velocity. Liquid is introduced to the scrubber and forms a film on the walls, which is atomised by the gas stream in the venturi throat. The efficiency of the venturi scrubber depends on the pressure drop, and consequently, they have high power consumption and operating costs. Venturi scrubbers are generally the most efficient wet scrubbing devices for particle collection, because they are suitable for submicron particles. They can also be used for trace gas removal, but efficiency is limited by low contact time.\n\nThe most commonly used wet scrubbers within the sector are packed bed scrubbers, usually with impact jets upstream. The impact jets remove the larger particulate matter and so help to prevent blocking of the packing. Some operators have installed ionising wet scrubbers (Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS)), which are intended to combine the advantages of the low capital cost of wet scrubbers, with the low operating costs of electrostatic precipitators. The Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS) is basically a packed bed scrubber maintained in a neutral charge condition and preceded by an ionising section to charge the particles. The bed is normally composed of plastic packing. Gas velocities through the bed are low so as to ensure that the particles spend as much time as possible close to the packing elements.\n\nWhen the waste gas from the forming area comes into contact with water in an efficient scrubbing system, the following events will occur:\n\na proportion of the entrained particulate matter, predominantly the larger particles and droplets will be held in suspension;\na proportion of any soluble resinous material will be absorbed by the water;\nthe volatile substances will form an equilibrium between the gaseous and aqueous phases.\n\nProcess water is the most commonly used scrubber liquor within the sector. This presents the potential problem of maintaining sufficiently low concentrations of volatile materials in the scrubbing medium to facilitate efficient absorption, and to prevent release back to the gas phase. The mineral wool manufacturing process is a net consumer of water, and the performance of the scrubber can be improved by introducing the clean water top up into the system in the scrubber. This benefit can be optimised by using a combined multistage scrubbing process with the water flowing from stage to stage countercurrent to the gas stream. In this way, the dirtiest water is used to scrub the incoming (dirtiest) gas stream and clean water is used in the final scrubbing stage. A description of a typical water circuit for the production of glass wool is presented in Figure 2.11, Section 2.9.1.\n\nA possible solution to the problem would be to separate the scrubbing medium from the process water system and either use clean water with a sufficiently high purge to maintain efficient absorption or to chemically dose the scrubber liquor with substances that would react with the volatile species. However, there are important limitations to both of these approaches. The use of a clean water system for achieving a substantially better performance would cause the volume of the purge would be too great to recycle to the process water system, and would give rise to a new waste stream requiring separate treatment. The volume of water coming from the impact jets would exacerbate this problem.\nThe water content and resinous nature of the substances contained in waste gas would cause blocking and scrubber liquor volume problems in a chemical scrubber unless a high volume purge is used. Due to the chemical content, none of this could be recycled to the process water system, again giving rise to a new waste stream requiring separate treatment. A further complication is that the chemical reagents necessary to remove phenol/formaldehyde and ammonia are incompatible and would require separate stages. Chemical scrubbing stages could be positioned in series with a process water scrubber, but this would greatly increase costs and unless it is extremely efficient, would not overcome the problems discussed. Also, when the aqueous waste stream is considered, the difference in overall emissions between such a technique and a process water scrubber with good process control is likely to be limited.\n\nMultistage scrubbing either in a combined unit or in separate units is, in theory, a potential option for the forming area and for combined forming and curing oven emissions. However, no mineral wool processes operate multistage scrubbers and so no information is available on their environmental performance, costs or potential operating problems. Therefore, the technique cannot currently be considered fully available. It could, however, be considered an option if line emissions are very high at a particular installation.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \nThe emission levels achievable with packed bed scrubbers (with process water as the scrubber liquor) in the mineral wool industry are given in Table   4 .121.\n\nCross-media effects \nAn important consideration for wet scrubbers is the potential cross-media effect of creating an aqueous waste stream that requires treatment. In the mineral wool sector, this problem has been avoided by using process water as the scrubbing medium with 100 % recycling to the process water system. The use of clean water or chemical scrubbers would result in an aqueous waste stream (see Section 2.9.1, Figure 2.11).\n\nOperational data\nThe removal efficiency is limited for particulate matter by the low pressure drop, and for gaseous substances by the use of process water as the scrubbing medium. Significantly lower emission levels for phenol, formaldehyde and ammonia would be expected with clean water scrubbing. The process water equilibrium is a critical factor and it is possible in some rare instances (e.g. a low binder product following a sustained period on a high binder product) that the efficiency of the scrubber could be negative for gaseous components.\n\nSeveral operators have used ionising wet scrubbers in recent years, but overall results have been disappointing. Improvements in efficiency over packed bed scrubbers have generally been less than 10 %.\n\nThere is no experience of chemical or multistage scrubbing in this sector but experience in the chemical industry suggests that emissions of below 10 mg/Nm3 could be readily achieved for phenol, formaldehyde and ammonia, if the associated problems could be overcome. Compared with the data shown in Table   4 .121, this only represents a significant improvement for ammonia.\n\nApplicability\nIn principle, packed bed scrubbers circulating process water are applicable to all processes within the sector. The technique is not limited to new plants or substantial modifications, but costs are likely to be higher for existing installations. In some applications, particularly stone wool, other techniques can be used to achieve similar or lower emission levels.\n\n\n\nIn glass wool production, slightly less than 20 % of installations use packed bed scrubbers, either for combined forming area and curing oven emissions or just for the forming area. In stone wool production, packed bed scrubbers are used for approximately 10 % of installations for forming area emissions and the same for the curing area. Emissions from the two areas are not generally combined in stone wool installations.\n\nEconomics\nCosts for this technique are given in Table   4 .122 and depend largely on airflow and plant size. Incorporation of an ionising stage as in the ionising wet scrubber (Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS)) involves an increase in capital costs of approximately 75 %, and an approximate 10 % increase in operating costs. Multistage chemical scrubbing could be expected to cost up to twice the totals given in the table. The cost of a combined multistage scrubber would probably be more comparable to the Ionising Wet Scrubber (IWS) system. However, it would be necessary to completely separate the stages, which would add to the cost, and more expensive corrosion-resistant materials may be necessary.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nA benefit of this technique is the opportunity to combine the forming area and curing oven emissions in a single treatment stage. The volume of the forming area waste gas is generally ten times greater than that of the curing oven. If implemented at the design stage, the combination of the waste gases does not add substantially to the overall cost of the technique.\n\nExample plants\nKnauf Insulation, St. Helens, UK\nURSA, Spain \nIsover Orange, France\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3219384_abstract", "x": 0.7135798, "y": 0.29913673, "title": "WALLS FOR CATALYTIC BEDS OF RADIAL- OR AXIAL-FLOW REACTORS", "year": 2017, "text": "Radial or axial-radial flow catalytic chemical reactor comprising a cylindrical shell (2) and at least one catalytic bed (5) and comprising a plurality of perforated tubes (10), said tubes having an open end (11) communicating with an inlet (3) of a gaseous flow of reagents in the reactor (2), said tubes being provided with a plurality of holes (14) on their side surface, said tubes (10) being arranged around the catalytic bed so as to form an outer wall (6) which bounds the catalytic bed and which distributes the reagents inside said bed; each of said tubes being formed by means of longitudinal or helical butt welding of a perforated strip (15).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.6.3.4\" title=\"Catalytic decomposition\">\n<references_to>2.6.12.2, 4.3.6.3</references_to>\n\n<content>\nCatalytic decomposition\n\nDescription\nThis technique consists in converting free chlorine to chloride and oxygen by using nickel-, iron- or cobalt-based catalysts. Catalytic decomposition can be carried out in fixed-bed reactors or with a catalyst slurry.\n\nTechnical description\nThe catalytic decomposition occurs according to the following overall reaction:\n\n2 NaOCl - 2 NaCl + O2|\n\nThis decomposition reaction generally occurs in hypochlorite solutions, albeit too slowly to remove free chlorine in technical systems. The reaction is accelerated by metal catalysts, lower pH values and higher temperatures (Section 2.6.12.2). Depending on the conditions, hypochlorite may instead decompose to chloride and chlorate (Section 4.3.6.3.5).\n\nSome systems operate with a catalyst slurry, which uses solutions of nickel, iron or cobalt compounds added to the waste water in stirred or agitated tanks . Metal concentrations are typically 20 mg/l . The high pH value of the solution causes the metal ions to precipitate as their hydroxides, which are then removed and regenerated. Alternatively, a fine dispersion of an insoluble metal compound can be used, which removes the need for the catalyst regeneration stage. In both cases, the catalyst must be allowed to settle before the supernatant water can be discharged, to avoid emissions of heavy metals. The reaction time combined with the settling of the catalyst takes several days . The catalyst activity decreases from batch to batch, although it is unclear whether this is due to deactivation of the catalyst or loss of metal .\n\nOther systems operate with the catalyst on a fixed-bed reactor (Figure   4 .42). The catalyst used is a nickel oxide promoted with iron on an alumina support. The design of the reactor is modular. The gravity-fed hypochlorite solution flows countercurrently with respect to the evolving oxygen , , .\n\n\nFigure 4.42:\tFlow diagram of a catalytic decomposition fixed-bed reactor process installed on the blowdown stream of a chlorine absorption unit\n\n\nCatalytic fixed-bed decomposition is often used as a single end-of-pipe technique (Figure   4 .42), but it can also be combined with chemical reduction. In this case, the outflow of the fixed-bed reactor is further treated with reducing agents. This technique is typically used for retrofitting plants which already use chemical reduction. Another possibility is to integrate the catalytic fixed-bed decomposition in the liquid recirculation loop of the chlorine absorption unit. The advantage of this process option is improved safety, due to a reduction of the recirculating hypochlorite , .\n\nIn some cases, it is possible to recycle the effluent from the reactor back to the brine system. It is then necessary to control the concentration of chlorate and other impurities, in particular for the membrane cell technique. Chlorate may be formed in the chlorine absorption unit, depending on the hypochlorite ion concentration in the caustic scrubber recirculation liquor and the temperature in the scrubber itself .\n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWith a catalytic fixed-bed reactor, a hypochlorite solution of up to 150 g/kg can be treated in a single pass to free chlorine levels of less than 1 mg/kg in the pH range of 9-14 at ambient pressure and temperatures of 10-60 degC. The outlet concentration essentially depends on the number of installed catalytic beds. Since the reactor has a fixed bed configuration, no emissions of metals occur, contrary to classic catalytic decomposition. The lifetime of the catalyst is reported to be several years. This technique also reduces the levels of hypobromite, but not of chlorate or bromate. Moreover, the produced oxygen (i.e. the intermediate atomic oxygen on the catalyst surface) may react with organic compounds, thereby reducing the chemical oxygen demand (Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)) , , .\n\nCross-media effects\nA potential emission of heavy metals occurs in systems using a catalyst slurry. In systems with a fixed bed configuration, no emissions of heavy metals occur, as the catalyst is fixed in the bed. In both cases, the spent catalysts can usually be recycled. Otherwise, they become hazardous waste , .\n\nEconomics\nThe costs of a catalytic decomposition fixed-bed system will mainly depend on the quantity of free chlorine to be treated. Investment costs for a new decomposition unit were reported to be in the same order of magnitude as for a new chemical reduction unit. Operating costs are mostly linked to the catalyst, but also include electricity for pumps and steam for preheating, if necessary. A cost example is shown in Table   4 .80 . The flowrates and hypochlorite concentrations before treatment are typical for a plant with a chlorine capacity of approximately 100 kt/yr. The hypochlorite concentration after treatment is too high for discharges of the waste water to the environment or a sewerage system. The waste water therefore requires further treatment, if not recycled back to the brine system.\n\n\nTable 4.80:\tTypical operating costs for partial hypochlorite destruction using catalytic fixed-bed decomposition or chemical reduction\n\n\nExample plants\nFixed-bed catalytic decomposition has been installed in seven chlor-alkali plants worldwide since 1993 :\n\nShin-Etsu Chemicals in Naoetsu (Japan), chlorine capacity 45 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1993;\nSasol (formerly Polifin) in Sasolburg (South Africa), chlorine capacity 145 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1994;\nMitsui Toatsu in Nagoya (Japan), catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1996;\nSolvic in Jemeppe (Belgium), chlorine capacity 174 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 1997;\nHanwha Chemical in Yeosu (South Korea), chlorine capacity 664 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 2005;\nTsurumi Soda in Yokohama (Japan), catalytic decomposition put into operation in 2008;\nShintech in Plaquemine, Louisiana (United States), chlorine capacity 418 kt/yr, catalytic decomposition put into operation in 2008 and 2010 (two units).\n\nBesides the above-mentioned chlor-alkali plants, the catalytic fixed-bed decomposition process has been installed at approximately 30 other industrial sites where there is a need for bleach destruction .\n\nReference literature\n, , , , , , .\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4167421_abstract", "x": 0.69814324, "y": 0.2540266, "title": "DIRECT-CURRENT COUPLING HYDROGEN PRODUCTION SYSTEM AND CONTROL METHOD THEREFOR", "year": 2023, "text": "The present invention provides a direct-current coupling hydrogen production system and a control method therefor.

The residual hydrogen is further scrubbed with caustic soda and then used to produce steam. The scrubbing solution is recycled to the hypochlorite production unit .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of these techniques include:\n\nreduction of energy consumption;\nreduction of raw material consumption (if hydrogen would otherwise have to be produced by other techniques);\nreduction of hydrogen emissions (hydrogen could potentially act as an indirect greenhouse gas ).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nCurrent levels of emitted hydrogen as a share of the total hydrogen produced are presented in Section 3.4.6. On average, approximately 10 % of the hydrogen produced by chlor-alkali plants in the EU-27 and EFTA countries is emitted to the atmosphere. This corresponds to a use of 90 % of the co-produced hydrogen as a reagent or fuel .\n\nAt the Donau Chemie plant in Bruckl (Austria), the excess hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid production is treated for use as a fuel, resulting in savings of fuel oil of approximately 500 t/yr .\n\nCross-media effects\nSome raw materials and energy are consumed if additional equipment is required to increase the share of used hydrogen.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nAn increase in the quantity of used hydrogen may require the installation of new equipment or the extension of existing equipment. Existing equipment may need to be adapted, as burning hydrogen leads to high temperatures .\n\nThe amount of co-produced hydrogen depends on the chlorine production rate, which often varies over time (e.g. load-shedding, see Section 4.3.2.3.1). Any use of the co-produced hydrogen needs to be compatible with these fluctuations .\n\nDuring start-up and shutdown operations, the hydrogen produced usually does not have the required purity for its intended use. This is due to the fact that during plant shutdowns the relevant parts of the hydrogen network are flushed with nitrogen to prevent the formation of explosive gas mixtures (Section 3.4.7.1) , .\n\nEconomics\nThe production of steam or chemicals depends on the existence of a respective demand. Although membrane cell plants often consume steam to bring the caustic produced to the commercial concentration of 50 wt%, some have enough customers close to the production unit that directly use the 33 wt% caustic from the cells .\n\nBurning of the co-produced hydrogen to produce steam, which can then be used to generate electricity in gas turbines, requires considerable investments for boilers and turbines .\n\nIn the past, several companies bottled and marketed the co-produced hydrogen, but most of them have progressively sold this activity to specialised companies. In addition to the required investment (e.g. supplementary drying and purification of hydrogen, compressors, filling station, bottles) and operational costs, a commercial network with respective front- and back-offices, procedures for quality control, management of orders and deliveries, as well as accounting needs to be created. This is typically seen as unattractive for a 'non-core' business with a limited quantity of product compared to what industrial gas companies are handling .\n\nAt the Donau Chemie plant in Bruckl (Austria), the payback time for the installation to treat the excess hydrogen from the hydrochloric acid production for use as a fuel was less than one year .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation of these techniques include:\n\nreduction of costs related to energy consumption;\nreduction of costs related to equipment.\n\nExample plants\nAll chlor-alkali plants in the EU-27 and EFTA countries use hydrogen to various degrees as a chemical reagent or fuel.

Selection of the appropriate technique depends on the composition, flow and conditions of the off-gas stream. The design of the abatement process is critical. Factors such as efficiency, suitability of the method and the input and output loading of the material to be collected are used. A full discussion of the working principles is given in the BREF document for non-ferrous metal industries. The following techniques are used in the foundry industry.\nDust and particle removal:\ncyclones\nfabric or bag filters\nwet scrubbers\nGas scrubbing systems (SO2, Cl, amine removal):\nwet scrubbing using scrubber towers, venturi scrubbers and disintegrators.\nOil-mist separators:\nwet electrostatic precipitators\nCO and organics removal:\npost combustion\nbiofilter.\nFor dust and particle removal, both wet and dry systems are used. The main advantage with using dry systems is that the dust is captured dry, which allows its subsequent re-use. Furthermore, no pollution is transferred to another medium, as is the case for wet systems. For gaseous compounds, such as SO2 and chlorides, bag filters are inefficient, since they are not adsorbed onto the filter surface. Experiments with lime injection have not provided good results. The following describes the system used for dust and particle removal:\n\nCyclones: If the right measures are taken (i.e. heat resistant steel, refractory lining) a cyclone filter may be used for dedusting hot flue-gases (500 - 600 oC). The efficiency is too low to achieve emission levels in the 20 mg/Nm3 range. The cyclone is mainly used as a spark separator in front of a bag filter. Cyclones are used as a pretreatment step to other abatement systems\nMulticyclones: The separation efficiency of a cyclone increases with decreasing diameter. The use of a parallel series of small cyclones allows the separation of small dust particles, without a sharp increase in the pressure drop over the cleaning equipment\nBag filter: This type of separator is widely applied in various parts of the foundry process, due to its good efficiency and low emission values. It can achieve good efficiencies in controlling the fine particulate matter found in melting operations. Sub-micron particles such as metallic oxides may be separated as well. For proper operation, the following measures need to be taken: flue-gas cooling (T = 130  160 oC) and separation of sparks (using a cyclone). The post combustion of organic material (to reduce the fire risk) may be applied for an off-gas with a high VOC content. Post combustion as a \"firewall\" for bag filter protection has been reported in some cases for off-gas from the unpacking of drums. This technique is not applied in general; instead waste gas streams with high dust loads are mixed with gas streams with increased VOC contents to prevent the filter and the exhaust ducts from becoming sticky. A view of the inside and outside of a bag filter unit is given in Figure   4 .77.\n\nFigure 4.77: Bag filter units; inside (l.) and outside (m., r.) views\n[237, HUT, 2003]\n\n\nHigh temperature filter systems (using a ceramic filter medium): These are available on the market but not currently applied in the foundry industry \n\nElectrostatic precipitators (ESP): These are not widely applied for foundry flue-gas dedusting. Due to their sensitivity to gas flow, gas temperature and humidity, they are only suitable for continuous melting regimes. They also incur a considerable explosion risk, due to the high gas volume they contain. The removal of dust to reduce this risk requires frequent cleaning, and therefore might incur economic problems. The main field of application for electrostatic precipitators in foundries is oil/mist removal from pressure die-casting exhaust gases. \n\nWet dedusting systems, such as venturi and disintegrators, are applied in melting flue-gas treatment. Scrubber towers are used for dedusting of non-melting off-gas. Compared to dry systems the wet systems have the following disadvantages: higher energy consumption, higher maintenance (corrosion, bacteria), and they result in waste water and a sludge for disposal. Advantages are the capture of water-soluble compounds (such as SO2, chlorides), quick cooling - which prevents dioxin reformation, low investment costs, and less restriction on input temperature. \n\nVenturi scrubbers: Water is sprayed into the gases as they pass through a venturi. The acceleration of the gas flow in the venturi throat causes an intensive mixing of both media. The dust particles are damped, making them heavier, so that they can be separated in a cyclone or other system placed downstream. If the gas flow drops, the venturi throat is adjusted to maintain the collection efficiency\nDisintegrators: These so-called dynamic scrubbers consist of concentric rotor and stator mounted pins through which the gas stream is driven by means of a fan placed downstream or by fan blades at the outer end of the rotor. Water injected into the centre of the rotor, is broken into fine droplets by the pins and dispersed in the gas stream. The wet particles impinge on the stator walls and are collected at the bottom of the disintegrator. The system works efficiently when the gas flow is reduced.\n\nPost combustion systems and biofilters will be discussed in Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.9, respectively.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions to the atmosphere.\n\nCross-media effects\nWet scrubber systems result in the production of a waste water flow, which then needs treatment. The cleaned water may be recirculated into the process. Sludge cakes, produced from the waste water treatment need to be disposed of.\n\nIf the foundry is located in a cold climate (heating season more than 6 months), all increases in air ventilation will also cause a growth in the energy consumption, since the workplace has to be heated more. \n\nThe use of all abatement systems require the use of energy to induce the draught of the gases through the abatement system. \n\nOperational data\nA comparison of the properties of wet and dry systems is given in Table   4 .106.

In order to minimise residue production, internal scrap is returned to the scrap metal feed of the furnace. \n\nFor steel foundries, a 100 % use of return metal is uncommon, due to the amount of dissolved gas. Operators consider 60 % to be the maximum amount of return metal (feeders, scrap castings,...) in the charge metal. Swarf and turnings may cause excessive molten metal oxidation.\n\nInternal scrap recycling may also be limited in the case of nodular base iron melting, as a high amount of silicon (about 1 % in most cases) is added in the liquid iron during the metal treatment.

However, during charging of the furnace it is possible that a visible smoke may be produced. This can be either due to the burning of contaminants in the charge, such as oil or paint, or due to the burner flame being extinguished and unburned fuel being emitted, as may be the case with solid or liquid fuels. In these circumstances, an afterburner may be installed. \n\nHoods may also be installed to capture visible smoke and fugitive emissions. The melting of clean scrap prevents or minimises these types of emissions. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA reduction of the emission to air of the products from incomplete combustion. \n\nCross-media effects\nSmoke capture will involve a usage of electrical energy. \n\nApplicability\nThis technique applies to new and existing crucible and hearth type furnaces. \n\nFor implementation, any constraints due to the current furnace design and operation need to be considered. These include physical constraints, for example due to crane tracks, the existing structural elements of the building, or due to the furnace itself. To be effective the extraction need to be fitted in such a way that it moves with the furnace body when it is tilted to pour, as tapping-out is one of the peak emission operations. This is not always easy to achieve with existing furnace bodies. There can also be physical problems related to the location of associated ducting.

Fabric filters are widely used to dedust the exhaust gases. Venturi scrubbers or disintegrators are applied less due to their higher energy consumption, the necessity for water treatment prior to discharge, and due to the need to dispose or recycle wet filter sludge. Fabric filters are widely used in favour of electrostatic filters, due to the wide fluctuations in gas temperature and the particulate concentration of the exhaust gases. \n\nIf a fabric filter is used, several precautions need to be taken in order to protect the filter medium as discussed in Section 4.5.1.3. These include:\nusing a high temperature cyclone or multicyclone\nusing gas cooling equipment. Here the exhaust gases are cooled by dilution with ambient air, water injection (quenching), heat-exchangers or by the use of long ducts. Water injection, in particular, has an additional advantage, in that the quick cooling down of the exhaust gases prevents the recombination of any partially burned organic substances, thereby leading to a cleaner emission. The cooling system needs an effective control system to prevent gases which are too hot from entering the fabric filters.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of particulate emissions from Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF). \n\nCross-media effects\nThe application of wet dedusting techniques causes a higher energy consumption, the necessity for water treatment prior to discharge, and the need to dispose or recycle wet filter sludge.\n\nOperational data\nOperational data are given in Section 3.2.3.4. Current bag filters have air to cloth ratios between 2:1 and 3:1. The air to cloth ratio is the ratio of volumetric airflow through the filter to the media area and is expressed in (m3/s)/m2, which yields the same result as the air speed through the filter media. \n\nApplicability\nThese techniques can be applied to all new and existing installations.\n\nEconomics\nThe costs for installing a new dust capture and filtration unit in an existing Polish Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) foundry using two 8.5 t/h melting furnaces are summarised in Table   4 .116. Dust emissions have been reduced from 10 - 13 kg/h and 145 - 150 mg/Nm3 to 0.2 - 0.25 kg/h and 2.8 - 2.9 mg/Nm3.

High air velocities carry the granulated bed material and the feedstock up through the combustion zone to the top of the combustion chamber, i.e. the freeboard.  The material then passes through a hot cyclonic collector.  Hot gases pass through the cyclone and the majority of solids drop to the bottom of the cyclone and are reinjected into the bed of the furnace.  Uncirculated flue gases pass to heat recovery and flue gas treatment processes.\n\nThe feedstock is introduced between the cyclone and the reactor bed, via a screw conveyor, from a holding silo.  No atomisers or special nozzles are required to introduce the waste.  A combustion air fan provides air to the bed for fluidisation and combustion.  The furnace draft is maintained by an induced draft fan downstream of the cyclone.\n\nThe retention time of the material in the furnace is controlled by controlling the discharge from the ash cooler.  Not all of the cyclone bottom ash is recirculated.  Some is removed via an ash conveyor.  The speed of this conveyor determines the rate of removal of material, so decreasing the speed increases the retention time.  This feature can, in appropriate circumstances, allow lower combustion temperatures, with consequent lower supplementary fuel requirements and less refractory damage and maintenance.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nFor animal meal, it has been claimed that TSE-risk materials can be destroyed, by destroying proteins.  The heat generated can be used to produce electricity, hot water or steam, which can be used either in on-site associated activities, or off-site.\n\nCross-media effects\nEmissions of SO2, HCI, NOx and CO to air and additional energy use due to the requirement for the destruction of protein to destroy BSE prions and to fluidise the bed.\n\nOperational data\nAt an example plant, a trial was undertaken using 100 % animal meal, with a calorific value in the range 17 - 21 MJ/kg, a thermal load of approximately 9 - 12 MW and a throughput performance of 1550 to 2550 kg/h.  It is reported that if in the same fluidisation bed, the throughput was changed to 2500 - 7500 kg/h, then a thermal output of 4.8 - 9.7 MW would be achieved.\n\nThe incineration in the circulating fluidised bed was carried out at a minimum temperature of 850 oC.  The gas residence time was controlled to approximately 4 s, by setting the ash removal rate.  The measuring system for testing the prescribed minimum dwell time of 2 s and the temperature requirements was located between the two return cyclone separators specifically, between the top of the furnace head and the inlet to the boiler.\n\nThe hot flue gases were directed from the cyclone, where they were separated from the heavier solid matter.  SNCR was used for NOx removal, by injecting urea into the flue gas stream between the return cyclone and the waste heat boiler, at a temperature of > 850 oC.  The boiler was used for heat recovery.  Further cooling plus inorganic chlorine and sulphur dioxide removal was achieved using a scrubber containing calcium hydroxide in suspension.  Carbon was injected to remove dioxins, furans and heavy metals.  A fibrous filter was used for dust removal.  Prions were not detected in the ash and it was therefore deduced that the proteins had been destroyed.\n\nThe achieved emission levels from this trial with 100 % animal meal incineration are illustrated in Table   4 .120.\n\nTable 4.120: Emissions incinerating 100 % animal meal in a circulating fluidised bed\n\n\nExample plants\nA trial dedicated to the incineration of 100 % animal meal was carried out at one circulating fluidised bed incinerator in Germany.\n\nReference literature\n[244, Germany, 2002, 334, Brunner C.

In rendering, raw materials typically contain about 60 % water.  Multiple-effect evaporators operate at relatively low temperatures and this prevents scorching of the animal by-products being treated.  Removing water by evaporation is an energy-intensive process, and low-pressure evaporators are more efficient at this than open kettles or other systems operating at atmospheric pressure.  At 50.7 kPa (0.5 atmospheres), water boils at 81.5 oC.  Evaporators can be made to operate at much lower pressures than 50.7 kPa, therefore, vapour just above 100 oC can be used as the heat source for the evaporators.\n\nAn effective use of the evaporative heat can be achieved in a multiple-effect evaporator.  After the separation of the raw materials into a solid and a liquid phase in a continuous system, by either pressing, centrifugation, or a combination of both, the liquid phase can be dried in a multiple-effect evaporator.  The heating-medium is the steam raised from the drying of the solid phase and from the evaporation in the other stages of the vacuum drier.  The Atlas process of mechanical dewatering is an example of such a process.  The heat consumption in this process is 400 - 450 kWh/t of raw materials.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced energy use for evaporation, i.e. by re-use of the heat from the evaporated water.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone.\n\nOperational data\nA multiple-effect evaporator is shown in Figure   4 .42.  In theory, the efficiency of evaporation can be almost doubled by each doubling of effects, i.e. twice as much liquid can be evaporated per quantity of live steam or vapour consumed in the steam jacket.  In a multiple-effect evaporator system, vapour from an effect is condensed in the steam jacket of a succeeding effect.  This is possible because the succeeding effect will be operated at a lower pressure and thus a lower temperature.\n\n\nFigure 4.42: Multiple-effect evaporator\n\n\nThe efficiency of evaporators can be improved by providing more heat transfer surface than that given by simply jacketing the boiling chamber.  The evaporators often consist of vertical tube bundles with the heating medium on the outside of the tubes and the product boiling on the inside.  Product is either moved up through the tubes, i.e. in what is described as a \"rising film\", or down-ward through the tubes, in which case the evaporator is called a \"falling film\" evaporator.  The product is fed into these evaporators in such a way and at such a flowrate that facilitates the formation of a thin film covering the inside of the tubes.  This results in high heat transfer coefficients and a tremendous amount of water can be boiled off within a relatively small area of equipment.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in fat melting, rendering, fish-meal production and gelatine manufacture treating more than 50000 - 100000 tonnes per year.\n\nEconomics\nThe capital cost of such continuous installations is reportedly higher than that of conventional systems and they are reported to be only suited for plants with a relatively high level of raw material supplies, i.e. more than 50000 - 100000 t/yr.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduced energy consumption and consequently reduced costs.\nExample plants\nAll rendering plants in Denmark.\n\nReference literature\n[249, GME, 2002, 268, Ockerman H.

A 1:1 mix of air:vapour gives an acceptable energy source with suitable heat transfer properties.\n\nFigure   4 .45 and Figure   4 .46 are schematic representations of two different evaporator types.  The evaporator shown in Figure   4 .45 is an older self-circulating evaporator, where the stickwater/evaporated stickwater circulates up through the heat-exchanger as a result of heating and vapour formation.  This circulation is not shown in the figure.  It shows the main steam and liquid flows.  The seawater flow through the barometric condenser is typically in the order of 200 m3/h, while the evaporation rate is about 5 to 20 m3/h.  The self-circulating evaporator is heated with steam from the factory boiler.  This is a very common evaporator type in the fish-meal industry.  This type of evaporator typically contains very large quantities of liquid and uses high temperatures in its first stage, where boiling temperatures of 120 - 130 degC are normal.  The large quantities of liquid lead to long average retention times and this, together with the high boiling temperatures, causes the stickwater/evaporated stickwater to be exposed to a severe heat load.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.45: Schematic representation of a 4-stage self-circulating evaporator\n[155, Nordic Council of Ministers, 1997]\n\n\n\nFigure 4.46: Schematic representation of a falling film surplus heat evaporator\n[155, Nordic Council of Ministers, 1997]\n\n\nThe evaporator shown in Figure   4 .46 is a falling film evaporator.  It shows the main steam and liquid flows.  The seawater flow through the barometric condenser is typically around 250 m3/h, while the evaporation rate is about 10 to 30 m3/h.  The stickwater/evaporated stickwater is recirculated and then pumped to the top of the heat-exchanger. Here, the liquid is dispersed into a large number of tubes where it runs as a film down the inner walls of the tubes to the bottom of the heat-exchanger.  Part of the liquid evaporates.  At the bottom of the evaporator, the liquid and vapour mixture is separated.  This evaporator type is typically heated with surplus steam from the driers but it can also be heated with steam from the boiler.  The evaporator typically contains very small quantities of liquid and this results in short average retention times.  Normally, relatively low temperatures, typically 55 - 60 degC in stage 1 and 40 - 50 degC in the last stage, are used when the evaporator is supplied with surplus vapour from the normal atmospheric pressure driers.  The product is submitted to a much lower temperature in this type of evaporator than in the self-circulating evaporator, so it has a better quality.\nIn the falling film evaporator, a correlation has been reported between the performance of the evaporator and the amount of carry-over in the impure condensate.  It is, therefore, possible to reduce carry-over by controlling the output of the evaporator.  The carry-over reported at moderate output from a falling film evaporator is reported to be slightly lower than the best results from a self-circulating evaporator.  No severe boiling-over was observed from the falling film evaporator.\n\nA self-circulating evaporator, in relation to a falling film evaporator, contains very large quantities of stickwater and evaporated stickwater which remain in the evaporator during temporary stoppages.  As stickwater and evaporated stickwater are very unstable, even very short stoppages can result in changes in the product great enough to have a negative effect on the discharge from the evaporating process on restarting the evaporator.\n\nThe large volume of the self-circulating evaporator requires very large amounts of water and NaOH for cleaning, which subsequently leads to large amounts of waste water.\n\nIt is claimed that use of falling film evaporators in the evaporating process of the fish-meal industry improves the product, as well as reducing the environmental impact.  The quality of evaporated stickwater from a falling film evaporator is reported to be considerably higher than that of evaporated stickwater from a self-circulating evaporator, due to the much lower temperatures to which the product is submitted in the falling film evaporator.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced energy consumption, due to using the vapour from the drier and by operating at lower temperatures.  Less water contamination by product loss and cleaning substances than when a self-circulating evaporator is used.\n\nCross-media effects\nSeawater is discharged at approximately 10 - 15 degC.\n\nOperational data\nThe secondary impure condensate received little contamination due to boiling-over from the self-circulating evaporator, until unidentified technical problems occurred in the evaporator.  In spite of this, the results of a statistical analysis suggest that the phosphorus content had a significant influence on the degree of pollution in the condensate.  A similar effect was not seen for the secondary impure condensate of the falling film evaporator, even though it often contained as much phosphorus as the samples from the self-circulating evaporator.\n\nThe quality of the evaporated stickwater from a falling film evaporator is considerably higher than that of evaporated stickwater from a self-circulating evaporator, because of the much lower temperatures to which the product is submitted in the latter.  The fish-meal extracted from the press cake, grax and evaporated stickwater, is also consequently of a higher quality.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in all fish-meal and fish-oil factories.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduced energy consumption and improved product quality.\n\nExample plants\nA fish-meal and fish-oil factory in Denmark.\n\nReference literature\n[155, Nordic Council of Ministers, 1997, 213, Nielsen E.W., 2001]\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3272415_abstract", "x": 0.61055315, "y": 0.2619873, "title": "METHOD OF BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF EXHAUST AIR, BIOFILM, PACKING MATERIAL OF THE BIOFILTER AND BIOFILTER MEDIUM TO IMPLEMENT THIS METHOD", "year": 2018, "text": "The invention concerns a method of biological treatment of exhaust air in an environment whose temperature exceeds 35 \u00b0C to remove volatile organic acids and/or their derivatives, a biofilm, packing material of the biofilter and biofilter medium to implement this method.

The system allows equalisation, COD removal, nutrient removal and clarification to be achieved using a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR).  The cycle comprises a timed sequence of operations and is divided into the following main stages: filling, reaction, settling, discharging and idle.\n\nBefore the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment, the waste water needs to be screened using a 0.5 - 1 mm mesh and then degreased.  If there is only one reactor, it is then collected in an equalisation tank prior to filling.\n\nFilling stage\nThe Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is filled with a quantity of waste water.  The filling can be static, aerated, anoxic and/or anaerobic and adjusted to the particular waste water by simply modifying parameters in the control unit.  This adaptability reportedly improves nutrient removal and prevents bulking problems.  The filling velocity can also be controlled and this affects the effectiveness of the final settling stage.\n\nReaction stage\nThe reactor is mixed and aerated in sequence to optimise the final removal of COD and nitrogen.  These can be controlled with dissolved oxygen or oxidation-reduction potential monitoring to ensure the desired efficiency with the minimum consumption.\n\nSettling stage\nThe biomass is separated from the treated water by sedimentation in the reactor.  The clarification is very effective since there is no countercurrent flow of the treated water.  The length of the sedimentation period can be modified during operation to improve the clarification.\n\nDischarging stage\nThe treated clarified liquid is discharged by a floating device at an appropriate height to ensure that neither settled solids nor floating debris are discharged.  Finally, the settled biomass is pumped away from the bottom of the reactor, to prevent a build-up of excess sludge.\n\nIdle stage\nWhen there is no waste water to be treated, the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is switched to an idle phase.  During this stage, it is not necessary to run the aeration systems at the same rate as during a normal cycle.\n\nAnother technique has been reported which is similar and which uses separate reactor vessels for aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic treatments.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental benefits\nThe COD reduction efficiency is reported to be as high as 95 %, thereby resulting in a low oxygen depletion potential in receiving waters.  Compared to other waste water treatment processes, the energy consumption is reported to be low, as there is no need for recirculation between tanks, since all the operations are carried out in the same tank.  There is no requirement to use chemicals and consequently there is no chemically contaminated sludge.  The sludge can be used, e.g. in composting.\n\nCross-media effects\nMost of the carbonaceous contamination ends up as CO2 emissions, which eventually contribute to global warming.  The nitrates output is higher than the input, because all of the TKN nitrifies into nitrates.  This is compensated for by the TKN output being very much lower than the input.\n\nOperational data\nCOD emission values of 22 mg/l have been reported from an Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) plant for a chicken slaughterhouse without total blood recovery.  An achieved sludge waste value of 0.05 kg SS/kg COD has been reported. \n\nAs slaughterhouse waste water contains nitrogen and phosphorus there is an associated risk of the eutrophication of receiving waters.  Emission levels as low as 0.2 mg/l of ammonium and < 1 mg/l of nitrates have been measured after Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) waste water treatment in chicken slaughterhouses, although it is reported that in practice the average levels in a plant with optimal operation is around 1 - 2 mg/l of ammonium and 5 - 15 mg/l of nitrates.\n\nSBRs can alternate anoxic periods with aerobic periods, thereby removing nitrogen from the waste water.  The length of the anoxic periods can be adjusted to create anaerobic conditions which facilitate up to about 40 % phosphorus removal.\n\nIt is reported that odour is not a problem if the biological reactor and the equalisation tank are well aerated.\n\nIt is reported that there is a low risk of accidents, since the plant works automatically and requires very little control by personnel.\n\nIt is reported that a de-foaming agent is the only chemical required and only during the first week of starting-up, due to blood in the waste water.\n\nTable   4 .102, Table   4 .103, Table   4 .104 and Table   4 .105 show data for a pilot plant and for three existing Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) WWTPs in poultry slaughterhouses.\n\nTable 4.102: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a poultry slaughterhouse pilot plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.103: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 40 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nTable 4.104: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 100 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nTable 4.105: Operational data for a Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) at a 470 m3/d poultry slaughterhouse\n\n\nThe Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is automated and controlled using a PLC.  The main controls are for the cleaning of the screens and the degreasing units rather than for the operation of the technique.  The operation of the Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is monitored by the periodic measurement of V30 values, i.e. by measuring the volume of a 1 litre sludge from the reactor after 30 minutes sedimentation time.\n\nThe cycle can be adjusted easily at the touch panel of the PLC and as required by the properties of the inlet waste water, e.g. if the COD:N changes or if there is a problem due to the appearance of filamentous bacteria, which create bulking.\n\nThe sludge is normally dried in a decanter, to achieve a 95 % reduction in volume.\n\nSBRs are reported to provide low maintenance secondary treatment, as they use less electromechanical equipment than other biological treatments.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable in all slaughterhouses.\n\nThe technique is reported to have the advantages of not requiring much space and not requiring a clarification system (sedimentation or flotation units) or separate anoxic treatment for denitrification or phosphorus removal.  It operates at a high solids concentration (MLVSS = 4000 - 5000 mg/l), so low volumes are required.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs\nSequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) is reported to be the cheapest secondary treatment, because the treatment can be carried out in one vessel.\n\nThe reported selling prices of some slaughterhouse Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment plants are shown in Table   4 .106.\n\nTable 4.106: Reported selling prices of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) treatment plants in 6 slaughterhouses\n\n\nOperational costs\nThe range of electrical costs reported is EUR 0.12 - 0.25/m3, for a EUR 0.06/kWh cost for electricity.  There are no chemical reagent costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driving force for the use of Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBR) in slaughterhouses is its capacity for removing nitrogen contents with a high efficiency and low investment and running costs.  The technique is flexible and conditions such as the length and frequency of anoxic periods, filling velocity, settling time and anaerobic periods can be easily altered using a PLC.

For example, a single tank may be divided into aerobic and anoxic zones.

The main part of the BOD and COD load can be removed without aeration. The introduction of air and the circulation of the biomass are achieved using 8 aerator chains.

Stomach and intestinal contents, as well as blood are also handled.\n\nThe slaughterhouse has a capacity of 25000 cattle per week, i.e. 5000 per slaughter day.

The process is controlled by monitoring the concentrations of ammonia and nitrogen oxides.  Consequently, a number of aeration devices are automatically switched on or off.  For example, a single tank may be divided into aerobic and anoxic zones.  During the alternating operational method, individual, sequentially arranged tanks are operated alternately on an aerobic or anoxic basis which coincides with the simultaneous transfer of effluent between tanks.  During the intermittent operational method, the tanks are operated in parallel.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRemoval of nitrogen, BOD and COD compounds from high loaded waste water steams, which have not been excluded by other means.\n\nCross-media effects\nOdour problems may be caused.  Energy is used, e.g. during aeration.\n\nOperational data\nThe technique is characterised by the removal of BOD without aeration, combined with the denitrification typically required for the waste water from slaughterhouses and animal by-products installations.  This offers the advantage of minimising energy consumption.  It has been reported that aeration can account for 60 % of energy consumption at WWTPs.\n\nThe aeration is achieved by diffusing the air through a very large number of fine holes, to ensure that there is enough oxygen in the waste water to undertake the nitrification required for the high nitrogen loads which are typical for the waste water from this industry.\n\nIn addition, the technique is characterised by high sludge ages, which also assist the denitrification process.\n\nAt one rendering plant where the treatment is applied, it is reported that the effluent is first subjected to fat separation, solids removal using cylindrical sieves, flotation, mixing and equalisation.\n\nThe treatment is then carried out in large-volume, foil-sealed earth basins.  Aeration is carried out intermittently.  Full nitrogen elimination, through simultaneous nitrification/denitrification, is reportedly achieved.  The main part of the BOD and COD load can be removed without aeration. The introduction of air and the circulation of the biomass are achieved using 8 aerator chains.  The aerator chains consist of 7 floating aerators, each connected to the others by means of air supply hoses.  The air is introduced in the form of small bubbles, over the basin floor.  The required quantity of air is made available through sliding vane rotary compressors.  A compressor constantly runs on base load in order to ensure a specific minimum level of circulation of the activated sludge.  The connection of further compressors is regulated by a timing programme and an automatic oxidation/reduction control.  By varying the rate of oxygen introduced through different chains aerobic and anoxic zones are produced.  The rate of oxygen fed through the chains is altered periodically, so that over time anoxic zones are intermittently created throughout the entire basin.  The intermittent creation of aerated and anoxic zones is achieved by stopping the aeration process at 33 % of the aerators at any one time.\n\nThe sludge is removed and the effluent is subjected to further aeration and sedimentation.\n\nDimensional and operating data of the aerobic treatment stage, at this example plant, are shown in Table   4 .82.\n\nTable 4.82: Dimensional and operating data of the aerobic treatment stage at a rendering plant\n\n\nTable   4 .83 shows the effluent emission levels achieved in the plant described in Table   4 .82 during the period 1992 to 1996.\n\nTable 4.83: Influent and effluent levels achieved during the period 1992 - 1996\n\nFurther information has been reported for another example rendering plant.  The WWTP is reportedly designed with a processing capacity of 580 t/d of animal carcases and designed for full nitrogen elimination, 2 tanks are operated in parallel with intermittent aeration.  The process effluent is subject to fat separation and flotation, followed by mixing with non-process waste water.  It is then treated in a clarification plant and an equalisation basin (1250 m3 with a reserve of 1750 m3).  It is then divided between 2 basins, each of 6240 m3 capacity.

The matte obtained is converted into low-iron nickel matte in a converter. In both processing steps, oxygen enrichment is used to reach an autogenous processing point. The use of oxygen enrichment allows the melting of returns, scrap and other secondary materials, especially in the converting step. Also, as the total gas flow is lowered, the electricity consumption of the fans (process gas, ventilation, etc.) is lowered.\n\nIn direct nickel flash smelting (Direct Outotec Nickel (DON)) technology, high-grade nickel matte with a low iron content is produced in the flash smelting furnace directly without subsequent converting. The dried feed mixture, oxygen-enriched process air and distribution air are mixed in the concentrate burner. The concentrate ignites and burns in the turbulent gas-solid suspension in the reaction shaft. The oxidation of concentrate feed is taken further than in the conventional process. This burning process generates a large amount of energy, causing the charge to melt. Flash smelting is an energy-efficient process since it makes use of the reaction heat of the concentrate, and therefore external fuel is only needed from time to time. The usage of oxygen enrichment in a flash smelting furnace has a significant savings effect on energy consumption and results in better pollution control. Matte produced using this process has a low iron and high nickel content. The Direct Outotec Nickel (DON) process has made a separate conversion step unnecessary, which has an important positive effect in terms of the environment and the energy consumption.\n\nHeat recovery boiler\nThe hot, SO2-rich gas produced in the smelting furnace or converting vessel is conducted to the heat recovery boiler. In the waste heat boiler, gas is cooled by generating steam from which energy is recovered. The steam is used for example in the drying of concentrates and for various process heating needs, such as in autoclaves. Electricity and heat for district heating may be generated from the extra steam in the power plant.\n\nIn indirect steam coil drying, the saturated steam produced in the heat recovery boiler connected to the smelting furnace is utilised.\n\nUse of flue-gas energy\nIn direct drying, the hot gas is produced by the combustion of fuel in a separate chamber. To recover the energy content of the hot gas from other process steps, anode furnace exhaust gases can be partly recycled into the dryer.\n\nHeat exchangers to recover the heat from the warm gas or solution flows\nWith regards to slag cleaning, the metals in the smelting/converting slag are removed in an electric furnace as an iron-containing nickel matte. Electric furnace gases are first post-combusted and then cooled. Heat from gas cooling is removed by a heat exchanger and used for heating and drying additives or coke for the electric furnace.\n\nProduction of sulphuric acid from SO2-containing gas produces extra energy, which is removed and utilised. Oxidation of sulphur dioxide to sulphur trioxide is an exothermic reaction. Part of the energy produced by this oxidation is transferred using a heat exchanger to intermediate water for heating other process units or is sent to a second heat exchanger for district heating.\n\nCooling of acid is carried out using a heat exchanger where energy is removed to intermediate water. Energy from the intermediate water moves via the second heat exchanger into a district heating line or to heat other process units.\n\nThe chlorine leach process is highly exothermic, and steam in the off-gas from the leach tanks is condensed and heat is recovered into a separate glycol circuit, which is distributed for heating offices and plant buildings.\n\nBefore recycling anolyte in the nickel tank house, the solution has to be cooled. A heat exchanger is installed to cool down the anolyte before reuse, and the heated water is distributed to other processes that consume hot water or used for cleaning purposes in other areas of the plant.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of energy consumption.\nReduction of emissions to air (in most cases the recovered energy replaces fossil fuel).\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPlant A: The direct electricity consumption of the nickel smelter is 1400-1800 kWh/t of metal produced, excluding for example oxygen and pressurised air (over-the-fence consumables). The fuel oil consumption in the smelter is 300-400 kg/t of metal produced including concentrate drying, flash furnace fuel, and fuel for heating up the Flash Smelting Furnace (FSF) and EF. The coke consumption in the nickel smelter is 200-250 kg/t of metal produced, including coke reductant in the slag cleaning electric furnace.\n\nPlant C: The refinery electricity consumption is 3000-4000 kWh/t of nickel produced. Heat consumption is 7 000-9 000 kWh/t of nickel produced. Plant A's copper and nickel smelters and Plant C's refinery are operating on the same site. The plants' companies have common heat recovery systems. About 50-70 % of the heat used at the site is recovered from the different process steps.\n\nPlant E: The refinery electricity consumption is about 5 MWh/t of nickel, copper and cobalt produced.

This slag cleaning process is based on slow-cooling of the molten slag, crushing and wet grinding of the cooled slag and recovery of copper by flotation to produce a slag concentrate. A slag concentrator is used where sufficient space is available and where the final slag can be adequately treated or disposed of. In order to achieve a good metal recovery, the material for slag flotation needs to be milled to a fine grain size. This final slag can be used for different industrial applications, although its potential for use may be limited due to the fine particle size and so some slag may need to be disposed of. The slag concentrate is fed into the flash smelting furnace together with the primary concentrate.\n\nThe energy consumption of a slag concentrator is lower than for the electric slag cleaning furnace process. No additional energy is required for the gas-cleaning equipment. Higher copper recovery can be achieved than with slag furnace treatment.\n\nThe slag concentration plant operates flexibly, adapting to variations in the feed. Decoupling of the slag treatment from the main smelter process is realised.\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are the following:\n\nWater sprays. Applied to suppress dust emission during handling, storage and crushing.\nDrainage system. Applied to recover water from all the operations performed under water spraying, to avoid soil and underground water contamination.\nCollection and reuse in the process of the water from the cooling area and the flotation process as well as from the hydro transport of the final slag.\nSpecial design for the slag storage basin to protect the soil and prevent underground water contamination, and retention of a water layer to prevent diffuse dust emissions. The final slags are transported to the final storage using hydro transport in closed pipelines.\n\nTechnical description\nIn the slag concentration process, slag is cooled by air and water sprays in ladles or pits. Drainage systems are installed at the cooling areas and water is recirculated. Water sprinkling facilities are installed at handling and storage areas to suppress dust emissions.\n\nSingle stage crushing is performed. Water sprinkling facilities can also be installed at the inlet of crushing and transfer points after the reception bins. The grinding process is a two-stage process, where the first step is an autogenous mill and the second a ball or pebble mill. The primary mill can be in an open or closed circuit, depending on the secondary stage. In the closed circuit process, the classifier can be a screen, spiral or cyclone type. The secondary stage is in a closed circuit with cyclones.\n\nSecondary grinding overflow is followed by flotation, which typically comprises a rougher, scavenger and two cleaning stages. Scavenger concentrates and first cleaner tails are circulated back to the rougher. Flotation is a physical and chemical process done in natural pH with a xanthate collector and frother. Grinding and flotation processes are performed with water, thereby preventing emissions to air.\n\nCopper concentrate is dewatered conventionally with a thickener and vacuum filter. Filter cake, together with the smelting feed mixture, goes to drying and back to the smelting furnace.\n\nWater is recirculated by drainage pumps and reused in the process. \n\nThe final slags are transported to a pond using hydro transport in closed pipelines. The solids settle in the pond; water is decanted and returned to the flotation process. The dam wall and the bottom of the pond are protected with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lining to prevent infiltration into the soil and underground waters. In order to prevent the drying out of solids and dust emissions, a water layer is kept on the surface of the pond. Dust suppressants, such as lime milk, can also be used on dry areas.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMinimisation of emissions to air, as slag cleaning is a wet process.\nWater is reused.\nRecovery of copper, and raw material savings.\nProtection of the soil and of the groundwater.\nFinal slag can be used for different industrial applications, such as road construction and other fill applications, for clinker production or as a mineral addition to blended cements, or as a component for iron/steel production.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAt Boliden Harjavalta, the slag from the copper flash furnace and the converters is treated for copper recovery in the slag concentrator. Slag is slow-cooled in ladles by a water spray. After cooling, the ladles are emptied by a hydraulic hammer. Then the slag is crushed by a cone crusher, ground by a lump mill and pebble mill, and treated in the slag concentrator. Copper-bearing particles are separated in flotation cells using air, water, flotation oil and xanthates. The slag concentrate is then thickened, filtered and recycled back to the copper flash furnace feed mixture.\n\nThe final tailings from the slag concentrator, mostly iron silicate, are discarded from the flotation cells and pumped into a specially prepared tailings storage area. Slag cooling area water handling is a part of the water circuit of the slag concentrator. The water in the slag concentrator is recycled and bled out to water treatment.\n\nAt Boliden Ronnskar, the slag from the copper flash furnace is treated for copper recovery in a slag concentration process. The slag is cooled in ladles, crushed and transported by covered trucks to a slag concentrator, where copper is recovered by milling and flotation. The concentrate is recycled to the copper furnace feed mixture. The final tailings are pumped in a specially prepared tailings storage pond, together with flotation tailings from ore flotation. The water in the slag concentrator is recycled.\n\nAt Aurubis Pirdop, the flash furnace and converter slags are transported to the cooling area by railway wagons. Slag is cooled in crystallisation pits by consecutive air and water cooling. Equipment includes a drainage system and pump station. All water for cooling is recycled. The cooled slag is excavated and transported to a receiving hopper or open storage area. Single stage crushing is performed by a jaw crusher. Crushed slag is transported by a rubber belt conveyor to two bunkers and then fed to the grinding section for grinding and classification. Grinding is performed in two stages.\n\nPrimary grinding takes place in autogenous mills. The first autogenous mill (capacity: 45-50 tonnes/hour) operates in a closed circuit with a spiral classifier. Overflow from the classifier enters a pump sump, and power hydrocyclones. The second autogenous mill (capacity: 100-105 tonnes/hour) operates in a closed circuit with two hydrocyclones. Secondary grinding takes place in a ball mill operating in a closed loop with three hydrocyclones.\n\nThe hydrocyclone overflow goes to flotation. The flotation comprises a classic circuit: rougher, scavenger and two cleaning flotations. First, cleaner tailings, together with scavenger concentrate, are pumped to the second rougher flotation. Second, cleaner tailings are pumped to the first cleaning.\n\nThe slag concentrate slurry is pumped from the flotation cells to a thickener. The thickener underflow is filtered with a disk vacuum filter. The slag concentrate formed on the filter is returned to the flash smelting furnace. The thickener water overflow is pumped via a tank to the process water reservoir, closing the circulation water cycle of the flotation plant.\n\nAll areas have floor sumps for the collection of spillages.\n\nThe final slag is pumped to a tailings pond by two slurry pumps in series operation. Slag is settled and water is pumped to a collecting tank, from where it returns to the slag concentrator to be used as process water.\n\nThe tailing pond is contained by a dam wall. The dam wall and the bottom of the pond are protected with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) lining to avoid infiltration into the soil and underground waters. The surface of the pond is kept under a layer of water to avoid fugitive emissions of dust.\n\nCross-media effects\nWater sprinkler\nIncrease in water consumption.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.\n\nEconomics\nThe slag concentrator requires:\n\nconsumption of reagents: xanthate ~ 240 g/t; frother ~ 7.5 g/t;\npower consumption for grinding: autogenous mill ~ 18.2 kWh/t; ball mill ~ 14.3 kWh/t.\n\nBuilding a final slag tailing pond (capacity of 1.6 million m3) involved an investment of up to EUR 8 million (2002, Aurubis Pirdop), including pump station, pressure steel duct, and closed circuit water system.\n\nAn upgrade and increase of capacity of the pond to 3.65 million m3, total area 220 acres, involved an investment of EUR 6.5 million (2008, Aurubis Pirdop).\nBuilding 45 new cooling and crystallisation pits involved an investment of EUR 1.350 million (2007-2009, Aurubis Pirdop)\n\nA project for expanding and increasing the capacity of the flotation plant involved an  investment of up to EUR 14 million (2010, Aurubis Pirdop), including for a second autogenous mill and additional flotation cells.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMinimisation of emissions to air and water.\n\nExample plants\nBoliden Harjavalta (FI), Boliden Ronnskar (SE), and Aurubis Pirdop (BG).\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4134527_abstract", "x": 0.7511665, "y": 0.3520973, "title": "METHOD TO CONTROL AN EXHAUST GAS AFTER-TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR AN EXHAUST GAS SYSTEM OF AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE", "year": 2023, "text": "A method is disclosed to control an exhaust gas aftertreatment system (14) with at least one catalytic converter (15, 17) arranged along an exhaust duct (10) and a burner (21), which is suited to introduce exhaust gases into the exhaust duct (10), wherein inside the burner (21) there is defined a combustion chamber (22), which receives fresh air through an air feeding circuit (23) and fuel from an injector (27); the method comprises housing a temperature and pressure sensor (33, 34) interposed between a pumping device (24) and the burner (21) or leaving the burner (21); acquiring the pressure signal (P33) generated by the combustion inside the combustion chamber (22) and detected by said temperature and pressure sensor (33, 34); and controlling the combustion inside the combustion chamber (22) as a function of said pressure signal (P33).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"9.3.1.4.5\" title=\"Techniques to reduce emissions to air from the carbonyl process\">\n<references_to>2.12.4.3, 2.12.5.1, 2.12.5.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nTechniques to reduce emissions to air from the carbonyl process\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are:\n\ncollection of off-gases (see Section 2.12.4.3);\nafterburner (see Section 2.12.5.2.1);\nbag filter (see Section 2.12.5.1.4).\n\nTechnical description\nThe off-gases from the carbonyl process (containing a carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl mixture and hydrogen) and those from system purges and plant blowdown are collected and piped to a central vent gas manifold. The vent gas manifold then feeds the waste gases in a controlled manner to the combustion chamber for thermal oxidation. \n\nThe combustion chamber comprises an air-cooled steel shell, lined with a heat-resistant refractory material. The combustion chamber is heated by two high-intensity burners, one fuelled by natural gas (fuel burner) and the other by waste gas (residual hydrogen from the kiln reduction stage). The gas burners are identical in design and are mounted tangentially to the furnace; this design promotes a swirling action in the combustion chamber, aiding full combustion. Each of the burners has concentric annuli, one to water-cool the burner and one to admit induced air for quenching the hot gases if required. In the combustion process, carbon monoxide and nickel carbonyl are mixed with air in the burner and combusted. \n\nThe nickel oxide formed is solid and is in the form of fine dust particulates in the combustion gas stream. The non-toxic waste (purge) hydrogen is fed into to the manifold as a support fuel to the waste gas burner. The pressure of the waste hydrogen is monitored and controlled by a water lute at ground level. In the event of a flame failure, the lute pot is vented to atmosphere via a discharge point. Hydrogen gas reacts as outlined below.\n\nThree basic controls are applied to ensure that the toxic and flammable gases are destroyed without overheating the combustion chamber:\n\nThe primary control is to ensure that a minimum temperature is maintained to oxidise any toxic gases present; this is done by adjusting the gas flow rate to the fuel burner.\nThe second control is designed to ensure that the maximum operating temperature of the combustion chamber does not become too hot for the materials used to construct the furnace. To control this temperature, the primary air directed to the return carbon monoxide burner is increased, and, if that is insufficient, secondary air is admitted to the burner.\nThe third control ensures that the maximum permitted temperature of the gases leaving the combustion chamber is not exceeded; as the temperature approaches the maximum level, a pair of dampers starts to open to admit quench air into the furnace and so dilute the hot gas with cold air.\n\nThe outlet duct of the combustion chamber is fitted with heat-resistant steel blinds. The angle of the blinds can be changed to control the flow rate of combustion gases out of the chamber and, if necessary, to close the outlet ducting. The outlet duct enters an exhaust. The combustion gases and particulates flow through the outlet blinds into the exhaust manifold which feeds into the gas filter system.\n\nThe combustion gas stream is passed through a reverse jet filter system, which consists of filter vessels each with an inlet and outlet damper. Each filter contains filter bags capable of retaining particles of dust down to submicron size, whilst still allowing the passage of the main gaseous stream. The dust filters have a burst bag detection system and are self-cleaning using a reverse jet pulsing system.\n\nThe collected particles descend into bunkers situated below the filters, which are discharged via rotary valves into slurry pots. Here the dust mixes with a continuous flow of water. The resultant slurry is discharged to the refinery effluent treatment plant.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of nickel and carbon dioxide emissions to air.\nRecovery of nickel from the waste gas stream, improving natural resource management.\nReuse of hydrogen waste gas from the carbonyl process as support fuel for the combustion.\nObtaining a stabilised kiln residue that can be further processed by high-pressure nickel extraction.\nFollowing high-pressure nickel extraction, cobalt/copper extraction can be performed.

The continuous caster is only used outside the EU-28, in Japan and Indonesia.\n\nThe most commonly used technique is a casting wheel that comprises a series of anode-shaped moulds on the circumference of a rotating table. Molten metal first flows into a tundish, from where it is directed to an intermediate ladle which fills one or two casting ladles. The casting ladles fill the metal into the moulds and the wheel rotates, taking the anodes through a series of water jets to cool them.\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are:\n\nenclosed tundish;\nclosed intermediate ladle;\nhoods over the casting ladle and (part of) the casting wheel;\nroof extraction combined with treatment in a bag filter;\nscrubber or demister for particulate removal from ventilation gases from the casting wheel.\n\nTechnical description\nA covered tundish, closed intermediate ladle, hoods over the casting ladles and the casting wheel, and roof extraction are used to prevent and reduce diffuse emissions during casting. Hoods and enclosures are maintained with efficient extraction. Collected fumes from the casting area are usually combined with the anode furnace off-gases and subsequently treated in bag filters (see Section 3.3.3.6).\n\nWet ventilation gases from the casting wheel cooling hood are treated in a scrubber or demister for particulate removal. Solids from the scrubber are recycled back to the smelter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of diffuse emissions to air.\nCollected dust/solids are recycled to the smelting process.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAt Atlantic Copper, anode casting is performed with two fully automated casting wheels with 28 and 20 moulds. The casting rate is 70 t/h and 40 t/h. The water vapour produced and captured during casting is sent to a demister for collecting particulates, and the gas (47 000 Nm3/h) is then released into the atmosphere. Dust emissions of between 4 mg/Nm3 and 15 mg/Nm3 are reported. Water to cool the anodes is used in a closed loop system with a cooling tower.\n\nIn Aurubis Hamburg, anode casting is performed with a fully automated single casting wheel with 24 moulds. The casting rate is 80 t/h. The water vapour produced during casting is vented off from the system, particulates are precipitated in a demister and the gas is then released into the atmosphere, containing less than 5 mg/Nm3 solid matter as a daily average. In 2009, a project for collecting and cleaning the fugitive emissions in the anode furnace and casting machine area was completed. Part of the anode casting plant is encapsulated. A reduction of diffuse emissions from the anode furnaces and the anode casting wheel of up to 70 % was achieved by this project. Anode furnace off-gases are treated together with the dry exhaust streams from the casting system in a bag filter with lime milk injection.\n\nIn Aurubis Lunen, the whole anode smelter building is ventilated, and the off-gases are cleaned in bag filter units with a capacity of 300 000 m3/h.\n\nIn Boliden Harjavalta, anode casting is performed with a fully automated single casting wheel with 28 moulds. The casting rate is typically 70 t/h. Ventilation gases from the casting wheel cooling hood are treated in a vortex scrubber for particulate removal at a flow rate of 15 000 Nm3/h. Solids from the scrubber are bled to the anode casting closed cooling water circuit, and recycled batch-wise back to the smelting. Dust measurements after the scrubber are performed twice a year. Levels of 20 mg dust/Nm3 are reported.\n\nIn Metallo-Chimique Beerse, the new casting wheel is a fully automated single casting wheel. Ventilation gases from the casting wheel cooling hood are treated in a bag filter. Levels of dust are maintained below 5 mg/Nm3. Water to cool the anodes is used in a closed loop system. Solid particles from the anode cooling water are allowed to settle and are returned to the furnaces.\n\nIn KGHM Glogow 1 and Legnica, the anode casting is performed with a fully automated twin-wheel casting machine with two lots of 16 moulds. In Glogow 2, there are two casting wheels (a single casting wheel with 28 moulds for stationary anode furnaces and a twin-wheel casting machine with two lots of 18 moulds for rotary anode furnaces). The tapping sections of all anode furnaces have ventilation systems, from which gas is dedusted and desulphurised together with the main stream of anode furnace gases. During the casting process, molten copper from the anode furnace flows through a closed chute and a tundish to a casting area equipped with a ventilation system, from which sucked air loaded only with vapour is discharged through the local stack.\n\nCross-media effects\nIncrease in energy use.\nEffluent water is produced from the scrubbers that needs additional treatment to prevent the discharge of metals to water.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nTechniques for off-gas collection and subsequent filtration systems are applicable for new and existing installations, depending on the design and the availability of space for the casting equipment.\n\nEconomics\nApproximately EUR 7 million were invested at Aurubis Hamburg for measures to capture diffuse emissions from the anode furnace and casting wheel.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of emissions.\nRaw material savings.\n\nExample plants\nAtlantic Copper Huelva (ES), Aurubis Hamburg and Lunen (DE), Boliden Harjavalta (FI), Metallo-Chimique Beerse (BE), KGHM Glogow 1, Glogow 2 and Legnica (Plants Legnica (PL)).\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4245884_abstract", "x": 0.43262538, "y": 0.49368933, "title": "GAS CLEANING METHOD, METHOD OF PROCESSING SUBSTRATE, METHOD OF MANUFACTURING  SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE, AND SUBSTRATE PROCESSING APPARATUS", "year": 2023, "text": "A gas cleaning method includes (a) removing a first metal element as one of contaminants from a process chamber by supplying a chlorine-containing gas into the process chamber (201) without supplying an oxygen-containing gas; and (b) removing a second metal element as another one of the contaminants from the process chamber by supplying the oxygen-containing gas into the process chamber (201), wherein (b) is performed after (a).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"9.3.1.4.4\" title=\"Techniques to reduce emissions from electrowinning\">\n\n<content>\nTechniques to reduce emissions from electrowinning\n\nDescription\nThe techniques to consider are:\n\nonline monitoring of critical process parameters like temperature, flow and use of electricity;\ncollection and reuse of chlorine gas and use of a dimensionally stable anode (Dimensionally Stable Anode (DSA));\ncovering of cells with polystyrene beads to prevent the release of aerosols to air;\nuse of foaming agents to cover the cells with a stable foam layer.\n\nTechnical description\nThe electrowinning process produces gases at the anode and may produce metal-containing acid mist due to bubbles in the electrolyte that burst at the surface of the solution.\n\nDuring chloride-based electrowinning, the chloride ions will be drawn to the anodes and be discharged as chlorine gas. The anode, a so-called dimensionally stable anode (Dimensionally Stable Anode (DSA)), is contained in a diaphragm and enclosed by a collection hood. The chlorine gas collected directly from the anode is blown into a central system and returned to the leaching stage. During the electrowinning, polystyrene beads are used as a cover on top of the cells, to prevent mist from bubbles in the electrolyte solution that burst at the surface from entering the room atmosphere and finally the air. It is important that the entire cell is continuously covered with polystyrene beads. The electrolyte is separated into two phases after passing through the electrowinning tank. Chlorine-containing anolyte from the anodes is transported to a tank for removal of chlorine, and then mixed with the chlorine-free anolyte from the overfall in the electrowinning tank. The chlorine gas is finally reused in the process. \n\nDuring sulphate-based electrowinning, the following reaction takes place: NiSO4 + H2O - Ni + H2SO4 +  1/2  O2. Nickel sulphate solution is fed into the diaphragm bags where cathodes are located. Nickel is precipitated on the cathodes. Sulphate ions react with water and generate sulphuric acid, which is recycled to the leaching stage. Oxygen gas from the anode is released to the workplace environment and via ventilation to the atmosphere. Anode gases contain nickel and acid mists.

It is also important for the furnace energy efficiency.\n\nTin emissions can be avoided if the temperature of the melt in refining and casting operations is below 500 degC. Indeed, as shown in Figure   5 .87, the vapour pressure of tin is very low (negligible compared to lead) up to temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius above the melting point of tin.

To collect the emissions, an extraction hood is placed on the crucible furnace or kettle. Refining kettles can be covered with lids that remain closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Fume extraction should also be used at the launders and tapping points.

Direct heating of the kettle with a gas burner is also applied. Refining kettles are not considered suitable for melting scrap (lead and tin) which contains higher amounts of organic materials. All equipment is installed in a building with additional measures applied to prevent emissions escaping outside.\n\nAt Metallo-Chimique, vacuum distillation is used to separate a lead-tin alloy. Kettles are used for (re)melting and refining.

Lids are closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Only large blocks/scrap are fed into the furnace. Fume extraction is applied. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Dusty dross/residues are removed by a closed mechanical skimmer and discharged into closed containers. Hoods are installed to capture fumes arising from lead casting. All the collected gases from the refining steps are treated in a centralised bag filter.

The residual heat of the burners is used to produce steam of 10 bar in a boiler. All kettles are provided with closed lids and held in a negative pressure. Dross removal is done automatically under aspiration with a closed skimming system. The air of all dry processes is cleaned in a bag filter.

It is also important for the furnace energy efficiency.\n\nTin emissions can be avoided if the temperature of the melt in refining and casting operations is below 500 degC. Indeed, as shown in Figure   5 .87, the vapour pressure of tin is very low (negligible compared to lead) up to temperatures of several hundred degrees Celsius above the melting point of tin. This figure has been created by Metallo-Chimique based on the data mentioned in .\n\n\nFigure 5.87:\tComparison between lead and tin vapour pressures\n\n\nClosed mechanical skimmers to remove dusty dross/residues\nDusty dross/residues are removed by a closed mechanical skimmer and are then discharged in closed containers.\n\nLids, or hoods on the furnaces or kettles with fume extraction (see Section 2.12.4.3)\nA crucible furnace or kettle is applied to melt lead and tin material. To collect the emissions, an extraction hood is placed on the crucible furnace or kettle. Refining kettles can be covered with lids that remain closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Fume extraction should also be used at the launders and tapping points. The collected emissions are subsequently sent to a bag filter, or to a wet scrubber in the case of exhaust gases from wet refining processes or gases containing sticky material, e.g. sodium hydroxide.\n\nVacuum smelting and refining technology\nA lead-tin alloy can also be separated into lead and tin by vacuum distillation at high temperatures.\n\nFor the other techniques, see the sections referred to above.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nTemperature control of the melt\nPrevention of heavy metal emissions and reduction in energy consumption.\n\nClosed mechanical skimmers to remove dusty dross/residues\nPrevention of diffuse emissions.\n\nLids, or hoods on the furnaces or kettles with fume extraction\nReduction of diffuse emissions.\n\nBag filter\nReduction of dust and heavy metal emissions.\nReduction in raw material consumption.\nCollected material is recycled in the smelting process.\n\nWet scrubber\nSee Sections 2.12.5.1.6 and 2.12.5.2.2.\n\nVacuum smelting and refining technology\nReduction of dust and heavy metal emissions.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nRemelting, refining and alloying is usually carried out in indirectly heated crucible furnaces or kettles heated by electricity, oil or gas. Direct heating of the kettle with a gas burner is also applied. Refining kettles are not considered suitable for melting scrap (lead and tin) which contains higher amounts of organic materials. All equipment is installed in a building with additional measures applied to prevent emissions escaping outside.\n\nAt Metallo-Chimique, vacuum distillation is used to separate a lead-tin alloy. Kettles are used for (re)melting and refining. Table   5 .251 shows the dust emissions from these processes.\n\n\nTable 5.251:\tEmissions from the refining process in Metallo-Chimique Beerse\n\n\nAt Aurubis Hamburg and at KGHM's plant in Legnica, refining kettles are covered with lids. Lids are closed during the refining reaction and the addition of chemicals. Only large blocks/scrap are fed into the furnace. Fume extraction is applied. Molten lead is automatically pumped in a closed system and transferred from one refining step to another. Dusty dross/residues are removed by a closed mechanical skimmer and discharged into closed containers. Hoods are installed to capture fumes arising from lead casting. All the collected gases from the refining steps are treated in a centralised bag filter. In the cleaned off-gas, levels of dust between 0.5 mg/Nm3 and 10 mg/Nm3 (half-hourly average) and between 0.5 mg/Nm3 and 4.9 mg/Nm3 (daily average) are reported based on continuous measurement.\n\nIn the lead refinery of Umicore Hoboken, impure lead is refined in a series of kettles, which are heated with low-NOX gas burners. The residual heat of the burners is used to produce steam of 10 bar in a boiler. All kettles are provided with closed lids and held in a negative pressure. Dross removal is done automatically under aspiration with a closed skimming system. The air of all dry processes is cleaned in a bag filter. The Sb, Sn and As salts are removed from the lead in the Harris process and treated further in a hydrometallurgical process. Exhaust gases and vapours from these processes, together with the exhaust gases from kettles where sodium hydroxide is used, are cleaned with a wet scrubber.\n\nTable   5 .252 shows emissions data from the refining and casting process.\n\n\nTable 5.252:\tData emissions from refining and casting\n\n\nCross-media effects\nTemperature control of the melt\nNo information provided.\n\nClosed mechanical skimmers to remove dusty dross/residues\nNo information provided.\n\nLids, or hoods on the furnaces or kettles with fume extraction\nNo information provided.\n\nBag filter\nIncrease in energy use.\nTreatment of dust to recover the metals has to be done internally or externally.\n\nWet scrubber\nSee Sections 2.12.5.1.6 and 2.12.5.2.2.\n\nVacuum smelting and refining technology\nNo information provided.\n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe techniques listed above are generally applicable.\n\nEconomics\nNo information provided.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental regulation requirements. \n\nExample plants\nKGHM (Plants Legnica (PL)), Muldenhutten Recycling und Umwelttechnik (DE), BSB Recycling (DE), HJ Enthoven & Sons (UK), Metallo-Chimique (BE), Weser-Metall (DE), Aurubis (DE), and Umicore (BE).\n\nReference literature\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3208538_abstract", "x": 0.7687723, "y": 0.36197084, "title": "COOLING UNIT FOR OXY-BURNER", "year": 2017, "text": "The present invention concerns an assembly and a kit of parts comprising:\n(a) An oxy-burner (1) comprising a body extending along a burner body axis, Xb, and comprising a downstream end ending at a free end of the downstream end, said body enclosing a fuel line (1F) and an oxygen line (1Ox) separate from the fuel line, both fuel line and oxygen line having a separate outlet at or adjacent to the free end of the downstream end (1 D) of the oxy-burner, wherein a cross-sectional area normal to Xb of said downstream end of the oxy-burner body decreases towards the free end of the downstream end;\n(b) A cooling unit (3) comprising:\n\u2022 a cooling plate (5) made of a thermally conductive material, defined by a first and a second main surfaces separated by a thickness of said cooling plate, and an aperture extending from a large opening at the first main surface to a narrow opening to the second main surface, wherein the aperture is defined by an aperture wall which geometry matches the geometry of the downstream end of the oxy-burner to form a thermal contact therewith when the downstream end is inserted in the aperture;\n\u2022 a cooling channel (3C) defined by walls and comprising an inlet (3U) and an outlet (3D) for circulating a refrigerating fluid, wherein a cooling wall (5W) of said cooling channel is formed by a portion of the cooling plate.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"2.12.5.2.5\" title=\"Oxy-fuel firing\">\n\n<content>\nOxy-fuel firing\n\nDescription\nThe technique involves the replacement of the combustion air with oxygen, with the consequent elimination/reduction of thermal NOX formation from the nitrogen entering the furnace.

Dry scrubbing is based on the recovery of fluorides by adsorption onto alumina used as the scrubbing agent. The fresh alumina is introduced to a reactor stage together with the process gas from the electrolysis. Most of the adsorption of the gaseous fluorides on the alumina takes place in this reactor stage. The gas and alumina mixture then enters a dust removal system where the alumina enriched with fluoride is separated from the process gas. Most commonly, bag filters are used for dust removal. An additional adsorption is achieved in these bag filters due to the filter cake that is built up on them. The alumina removed from the process gas is used as alumina feed for the electrolysis (so-called secondary or fluorinated alumina).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of total fluorides and dust emissions.\nReduction of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) when Soderberg cells are connected to GTCs.\nFull recovery of fluorinated products which are returned to the pots.\nLower consumption of aluminium fluorides.\nUse of the raw material (alumina) as the cleaning agent, thus mitigating the need for reagents.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPlant-specific emissions were reported both for emissions leaving the Gas Treatment Centre (GTC) (stack emissions) and for total emissions (stack emissions and roof emissions).

For this operation, two Peirce-Smith converters are used in a two-step operation with slag recycling. The nickel-containing matte is further processed in another French plant for the production of high-purity nickel salts and nickel metal using chloride leaching and electrowinning. Iron is removed as ferric chloride by solvent extraction and some cobalt chloride is also extracted.\n\nDuring blowing, the process gas is expelled from the converter and is captured. The extraction fan control is adjusted to keep the pressure at the mouth of the converter below atmospheric pressure to avoid gas from escaping outside the fume extraction system. The fume extraction system is connected to bag filters further downstream. During settling or tapping periods, the gas exhaust equipment is also adjusted to avoid emission into the converter bay.\n\nThe exhaust gas is then cooled down by a heat exchanger under natural or forced convection and the collected dust filtered by a bag filter. \n\nSO2 emissions are not an issue as their concentrations in the process fumes are insignificant due to the thermodynamic equilibrium of the process.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nMetal-rich dust can be collected from the emissions to air and recycled in the ore smelting process.\nParticulate emissions to air are significantly reduced.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nDust emission levels lower than 15 mg/Nm3 were reported.\n\nLiquid effluents are of little importance because the gas treatment process is a dry process and the formation of liquid waste only results from the cooling of certain parts of the equipment (condensation).\n\nThe largest quantity of waste is solid slag which amounts to some 75 000 tonnes for an annual nickel matte production of 15 000 tonnes. Slag is tapped from the 60-tonne converter and then transported to a dedicated area where it is allowed to cool down to ambient temperature. Finally, this slag (categorised as waste) is transferred to a dedicated storage area.\n\nDust from the management of emissions to air is collected downstream. This dust, which is mostly composed of metallic and non-metallic oxides (FeO, NiO, MgO and SiO2), is collected in bag filters. The dust requires a specific treatment to be consolidated for further reintroduction into the process (at an earlier step into the ore smelter). Among the different binder options, concrete may be used as it is easy to handle and operate.\n\nOther solid waste materials which are produced in the converting process are ladle skulls and scrap.

The scrubber operates in a co-current phase for cooling, moistening and partial desulphurisation of the gases. This is followed by a countercurrent absorption column to reduce the final SO2 concentration to below the required level. \n\nGases containing sulphur dioxide are treated in a Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) unit that uses a slurry of milled calcium carbonate (limestone, < 40 microns) as a SO2 sorbent to produce clean gypsum. Gases are cooled down, dedusted in a fabric filter and the gases are passed to the desulphurisation system. After desulphurisation, the gases are sent to a two-stage drift eliminator and then to the stack. Gypsum is recovered from the slurry produced by the Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) and is sold.\nIn this case, the circulating suspension of limestone is pumped from separate tanks equipped with mechanical stirrers; the scrubber tank also has an aeration system. The tanks are sized to allow complete reaction of the absorbed SO2 with the CaCO3 suspension, oxidation of sulphur compounds to sulphates, and the formation of a coarse crystalline residue of synthetic gypsum, CaSO4*2H2O. Compressed air is delivered to the scrubber tank through a pneumo-hydraulic aerator to improve the oxidation of sulphites to sulphates. The reaction slimes from the first absorption stage, containing mainly calcium sulphate (gypsum), are sent to a filtration system. The gypsum, after dehydration in a filtration press, is unloaded directly into a storage container located under the press, from where it is transported to a warehouse, and then sold.\n\nOther scrubbing processes for gases with a low SO2 content are described in Sections 2.12.5.2.2 and 2.12.5.2.3.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of SO2 emissions. SO2 removal efficiencies range from 50 % to 95 %. Removal rates at the higher end of this range are only possible in ideal conditions in newly designed, dedicated installations.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nPerformance data are given in the metal-specific chapters.\n\nFor the Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system reportedly used in a Waelz furnace installation and in an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) when using Waelz oxide, a final SO2 concentration range of 100-500 mg/Nm3 is achieved with an Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) input containing 2-6 g of SO2/Nm3. A final SO2 concentration of 50-400 mg/Nm3 is reported as the best performance, , . \n\nCross-media effects\nAdditional use of energy and calcium carbonate.\nIf the sale of clean gypsum is not possible then waste will be produced.\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nApplicable to new plants. When using existing gas-cleaning equipment with a fabric filter that is designed to remove process dust, it can be used to capture gypsum if the filter capacity allows for this. When a filter is already used, direct injection is possible when temperature, moisture content and contact time are sufficient. An existing filter installation might be insufficient, as the amount of dust increases drastically and thus it might need to be replaced.\n\nThe Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system reported to be used in a Waelz furnace installation and in an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) when using Waelz oxide is applicable to all processes that have a Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) input that contains 2-15 g SO2/Nm3 (approximately 0.05-0.5 %) provided that there is a market for the gypsum that is produced.\n\nEconomics\nLime injection plants' investment costs are reported in the metal-specific chapters.\n\nFor the Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system reportedly used in a Waelz furnace installation and in an Imperial Smelting Furnace (ISF) when using Waelz oxide, with a capacity of 85 000 Nm3/h and an average inlet SO2 content of 15 g/Nm3, the capital cost in 2008 was PLN 14 million which is equivalent to EUR 4 million. The operating cost is approximately EUR 2100 per day.\n\nDriving forces for implementation\nReduction of SO2 emissions.\n\nExample plants\nLime injection: Hoboken (BE), Beerse (BE), Hamburg (DE), and Bergsoe (SE).\nOther Flue-gas Desulphurisation (FGD) techniques: Miasteczko Slaskie and Boleslaw (Plants Legnica (PL)).\nReference literature\n,  \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3748021_abstract", "x": 0.5594104, "y": 0.33532566, "title": "PROCESSING METHOD FOR ELECTRONIC/ELECTRIC DEVICE COMPONENT WASTE", "year": 2020, "text": "Provided is a method for processing electronic/electrical device component waste, which can increase an amount of electronic/electrical device component waste processed in a smelting step and efficiently recover valuable metals.

To produce a by-product or reduce the amount of wastes generated from these constituents, the following techniques need to be considered.\n\nSulphur recovery: Sulphur is converted to sulphur products such as sulphuric acid, or liquid SO2.\nCd removal: Cd is leached from the dust recovered by a hot ESP using sulphuric acid.\nHg removal: Hg is removed using either the Boliden-Norzink process or filtration with absorbents such as activated carbon.\nSe and Te separation: Se and Te are removed during (wet or dry) gas cleaning. The residues that are formed are landfilled or reused to extract these metals.\nAg, Au, Bi, Sb and Cu recovery: These metals are removed during refining as a complex element and sent to the recovery stage.\nMetals recovery in a waste water treatment plant.\nOther constituents are processed to produce oxides for recycling, or a crystalline slag.\n\nTechnical description\nGood waste management practices either enable minimisation of waste material or ensure the waste is transformed into a less harmful material. This can occur via a number of routes, which include concentrating, removing, stabilising, or recycling the undesired components, or by optimisation of the flocculation/filtration conditions to ensure less water in the residue that needs treatment.\n\nLead ores and concentrates can contain constituents such as S, Fe, CaO, Zn, Cu, SiO2, Al2O3, MgO and BaO, and, in more minor concentrations, Ag, As, Au, Bi, Cd, Hg, Sb, Se and Te. Secondary materials used are typically clean materials (i.e. lead paste from battery processing), but may contain Cu or Sb (scrap, grids, etc.).\n\nSulphur recovery\nSulphur is converted to sulphur dioxide, which can be used to generate marketable/reusable sulphur-containing products (i.e. sulphuric acid, liquid SO2, or gypsum). This avoids the generation of waste, which otherwise would have resulted from its abatement, see Section 2.12.5.4.\n\nCd removal\nDuring smelting, Cd is fumed and is precipitated by the hot ESP. To recover dust with a high lead content, Cd has to be separated out. This is done by a leaching process using sulphuric acid, and Cd is precipitated as CdCO3. After a filter press, this material is sent to a suitable landfill. The leaching residue is returned to the furnace process.\n\nSe and Te separation and Hg removal\nDuring wet gas cleaning, Se, Te and some Hg are removed. The complex residue is sent to landfill or used for metal recovery. Residual Hg in the process gas is removed by special processes (e.g. Boliden-Norzink process, Dowa process, or filtration with absorbents such as activated carbon), see Section 2.12.5.5, and the residues are treated and sent to landfill.\n\nAg, Au, Bi, Zn and Sb and some Cu recovery\nThese metals are removed during gas cleaning or refining. These metals can be processed to form oxides (e.g. ZnO) and/or an Ag-Au alloy, Pb-Bi alloy, Pb-Sb alloy or Cu matte for own use or sale. This can take place either on or off site. A small quantity of intermediates and/or wastes produced during the refining process are sent back to the smelting process or refinery for internal recycling.\n\nMetals recovery in a waste water treatment plant\nSome of the metals are discharged after treatment to the waste water treatment plant (Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP)), see Section 5.3.6.2. The treatment residues from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) are recirculated.\n\nAll other components of the lead ore/concentrate go to slag. A crystalline slag is produced which will contain some lead and other metals. The composition of the slag can be controlled before smelting by the addition of fluxes (some of which are waste materials) to achieve a material with good leaching properties. Compounds which are considered low value may be collected as a by-product (with a Pb concentration of > 40 %) to be sold to other smelters. In some cases, slags containing Pb, Zn and Cu are further fumed to recover value in downstream processes and to produce a slag that is low in metal and has low leachability and can potentially be used for construction processes.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nRecovery of materials.\nMinimisation of environmental risks associated with waste materials going to landfill.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNo information provided.\n\nCross-media effects\nSulphur recovery\nIncrease in energy use.\nUse of additives.\nWaste could be generated.\n\nCd removal\nUse of additives.\nWaste is produced that will require disposal.\n\nHg removal\nIncrease in energy use.\nWaste is produced that will require disposal.\n\nSe and Te separation\nIncrease in energy use.\nWaste will be produced if Se and Te are not recovered.\nAg, Au, Bi, Sb and Cu recovery\nNo information provided.\n\nMetals recovery in a waste water treatment plant\nNo information provided. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally applicable.

Using closed equipment such as closed mixing tanks, closed settlers and a closed storage tank feed in a closed circuit minimises the possible emission of VOCs. The minimisation of diffuse emissions can also be achieved by selecting a process reagent (solvent) with a lower steam pressure.\n\nTreatment of the purge from the solvent extraction process in a waste water treatment plant before discharge\nThe principal liquid effluent generated in the solvent extraction stage is the secondary raffinate. This effluent originates from the bleeding and is required in the hydrometallurgical process to prevent impurities accumulating in the solvent extraction, leaching and electrowinning circuits. This effluent is sent to the waste water treatment plant, where metals are precipitated as hydroxides and sulphate. The resulting water flow is discharged into the receiving media.\n\nTreatment of the residues (crud) to recover the organic solution content\nA residue known as crud is generated in the solvent extraction step. Crud is a stable emulsion made up of suspended solids, aqueous solution and organic solution, and it forms in the phase between the organic and aqueous solutions in the solvent extraction settlers.\n\nTo remove the solids from the crud, this residue is sent to a treatment plant where the crud pulp is pumped from the settlers and passed through a clay filter to separate the solids fraction from the remaining phases. The slurry from the clay filter is circulated back into the crud collection tank (where the treatment starts) until the solution is free of solids. The phases are allowed to separate in the tank, with the aqueous and organic solutions taken separately from the tank. The aqueous solution is pumped to the primary raffinate after-settler, in order to recover the organic solution, which is returned to the loaded organic tank.\n\nUse of centrifugation for the treatment of the slurry from cleaning and settlers\nThe slurry from cleaning the settlers (aqueous phase, crud and organic phase) is centrifuged to separate the solid from the liquid phase (solvent and water).

Concentrate treatment may cause some dust residues that are recycled and mixed with concentrates. When dust is too fine, a pretreatment such as micropelletising may be required. None of the residues produced in this process need special treatment. The roasting process is almost entirely enclosed. Due to the enclosure, process residues and waste flows are minimised. \n\nMercury is removed from the roasting gas and a mercury-containing residue is precipitated. This residue is mixed in weak acid and is separated by filtration. After separation, this residue can be stabilised and disposed of. Alternatively, this residue can be treated further by distillation to produce pure metallic mercury. In the Boliden-Norzink process, a saleable metallic mercury is produced if electrowinning is included. If electrowinning is not included, stable mercury compounds can be discarded via secure disposal. None of the EU-28 zinc smelters using the Boliden-Norzink process produce metallic mercury by electrowinning; mercury produced in the NFM process is classified as waste and has to be stabilised and disposed of according to valid legislation (e.g. landfill or salt mine).

The amount of precipitates depends mainly on the quality of the concentrates and the efficiency of the precipitation. One of the main residue fractions in the hydrometallurgical process route is iron residue (in the form of jarosite or goethite). Iron residue is mainly disposed of to landfill according to valid legislation (landfill regulation, environmental permit). The amount of iron residue produced is partially dependent on the precipitate type (goethite or jarosite), but more significantly dependent on the iron concentration in the concentrates. There are no techniques to minimise this amount. Low-iron concentrates may be used to avoid iron residue, but the availability of this type of concentrate is very limited. In the EU, there is only one plant which exclusively processes low-iron concentrates.

The diameter is 4.1 metres and the length 8.25 metres. The circulation of the copper melt within the holding furnace is achieved by an ascending flushing gas (mainly air, hence mostly N2) which diffuses through porous purging plugs. To keep the necessary melting temperature, natural gas is fired with a burner from the side with a capacity of 1.2 MW. The black copper is further manipulated with a crane and ladles into the converter. During the manipulation, the off-gas, as well as smoke gas from the holding furnace, is sucked by an induced draught fan into a bag filter.

Aqueous feed containing the cobalt is mixed in a liquid-liquid contactor with an organic solution containing an extraction chemical that forms an organometallic complex with the cobalt, resulting in its dissolution into the organic stream. As the cobalt extraction chemicals are typically acidic ion exchangers, acid is generated during the extraction reaction, which necessitates the control of pH with an alkaline neutralising agent, e.g. ammonia or sodium hydroxide. The cobalt-loaded organic phase will contain some co-extracted impurities since the extraction chemicals are not entirely selective to the target metal and a scrubbing step follows, where impurities are removed by mixing the organic phase with an aqueous solution typically containing cobalt. The cobalt is then stripped from the organic phase back to an aqueous solution by reversing the extraction reaction by mixing with aqueous solution at a lowered pH, which breaks up the organic complex and liberates the cobalt ions.

At startup, NOx emissions are higher (varying from 600 - 2000 ppm/1230 - 4100 mg NOx /m3) for the first 10 - 45 minutes, giving an extra emission of 100 - 1000 kg NOx/year. Shutdown results are in the same range as NOx concentrations (600 - 2000 ppm/1230 - 4100 mg NOx/m3) for 10 - 30 minutes, giving a maximum extra emission of 500 kg NOx/year. \n\nDuring normal operation, the percentage NO2 in the NOx varies between 50 - 75 %. Especially during startup, the NO2 emission is larger than the Nitric Oxide (NO) emission (70 % NO2, 30 % Nitric Oxide (NO)), colouring the stack gas reddish-brown or yellow. The visual appearance of this stack gas often results in complaints from people in the locality. This is a local problem and therefore will not be described in detail.\n\nVarious techniques are available to reduce NOX emissions during startup and shutdown, but investments are often high compared to the amount of NOx reduction achievable. Extra NOx emissions due to startup and shutdown are less than 1 % of the overall NOx emissions during a year. The measures could be considered to reduce the visual appearance of a fume. \n\nPotential end-of-pipe measures during startup include:\n\nHeating the tail gas. A furnace, steam heater or separate burner could be used to heat the tail gas. Operated between 180 and 450 degC, at the optimum for SCR/NSCR, this measure will reduce NOx at an earlier stage and minimise the startup period.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Installing an SCR facility with a large temperature range will allow NOX reduction at lower temperatures (from 180 degC and higher) and as a result, down-times for the SCR will reduce.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. Excessive emissions at startup can be minimised by the use of caustic, sodium carbonate or ammonia alkali scrubber.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry adsorbent material. NOx reduction at startup can be achieved by using a dry adsorbent, e.g. silica gel or molecular sieves.\n\nThe above procedures are less suitable during shutdowns, as pressure and temperature quickly reduce.\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits \n\nHeating the tail gas. Exact figures are not known, but a NOx reduction of at least 70 % during part of the startup can be expected.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Exact figures are not known. Despite the lower temperature (from 180 degC and higher), some extra emissions during startup will take place, but for a shorter period of time. During the period that the SCR facility operates, a NOx reduction of 80 - 95 % can be obtained.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. Exact figures are not known, but a NOX reduction of at least 70 % during startup can be expected.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry absorbent material. Figures are not known but a NOX reduction of at least 70 % during startup can be expected.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nHeating the tail gas. Energy is required to raise the temperature to the optimum needed for the SCR or NSCR facility.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. The NH3 added to the SCR and the nitrous gases in the tail gas could react to form ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite when the tail gas passes through an SCR as a result of these unstable process conditions and low temperatures during startup. Deposits of these salts could potentially cause an explosion. The temperature of the tail gas must be 180 degC or higher when the SCR is started, to minimise the risk.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. A large amount of water vapour will escape from the scrubber liquid due to the high tail gas temperature when an SCR is used at between 200 and 350 degC. As a result, water consumption is high. The used scrubber fluid cannot be re-used, and it has to be disposed of as waste.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry adsorbent material. The spent adsorbent material is a waste for disposal.\n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo specific information provided.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nHeating the tail gas. A tail gas heating unit needs lots of space, particularly when enclosed, but can be applied in new and existing nitric acid plants with an SCR or an NSCR. Energy is needed to raise the temperature to the optimum needed for the SCR or NSCR facility, i.e. 180 to 450 degC.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Enough space should be available to install this facility. When the old catalyst is replaced, the new one should fit into the facility. \n\nInstalling a scrubber. There must be enough space to place the rather large scrubber facility.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry adsorbent material. Free space must be available and sufficient to install an adsorber facility. The high temperatures that are necessary before the SCR can be started, i.e. 200 - 350 degC, could damage the adsorbent.\n\n\nEconomics\n\nGenerally, most end-of-pipe technologies to reduce startup and shutdown emissions are quite expensive in comparison to the NOx reduction. \n\nHeating the tail gas. Equipment costs for a burner are approximately NLG 200000 (about EUR 91000). Installing a furnace (equipment and engineering) will cost at least NLG 1000000 (EUR 450000). Other economics are not known.\n\nInstalling a low temperature SCR. Capital costs of a complete SCR facility are at least NLG 1000000 (about EUR 450000). To reduce only the startup emissions, the costs of an SCR are unacceptable in most cases. Other economics are not known.\n\nInstalling a scrubber. Since water cannot be used as a scrubber fluid (the NOx turns the tail gas acid, so an alkaline scrubber liquid is required), the annual costs of the scrubber are expected to be considerable, although the exact figures are not known.\n\nInstallation of a tower with a dry absorbent material. Annual costs are expected to be considerable, since the saturated absorbent material has to be replaced regularly. Exact figures are not known.\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nReduction of the visual appearance from the reddish-brown or yellow stack gas.\n\n\nReference literature and example plants \n\n[88, infoMil, 1999]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2940006_abstract", "x": 0.6258743, "y": 0.22406878, "title": "Process and plant for the synthesis of urea and melamine", "year": 2015, "text": "An integrated process for the synthesis of urea and melamine, wherein: urea is synthesized with a stripping process in a high-pressure synthesis loop comprising a reactor, a stripper and a carbamate condenser, and the urea solution leaving said stripper is sent to a recovery section to produce a concentrated urea product and a recovered carbamate solution; at least part of said urea product is converted to melamine, and the off-gas from the synthesis of melamine are recycled to the urea synthesis by mixing with the gas phase from the stripper and with said recovered carbamate solution, thus forming a mixed flow which is then condensed in said carbamate condenser, and the condensate is eventually directed to the reactor.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"8.4.9\" title=\"Combined condensation and reaction in one vessel\">\n<referenced_by>8.5</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nCombined condensation and reaction in one vessel\n\nDescription\n\nBasically, with combined condensation and reaction in one vessel, two configurations are possible:\n\nstripper   +   combined condenser/pre-reactor   +   reactor (rather as revamp option)\nstripper   +   combined condenser/reactor (rather for new plants).\n\nPool reactor. The stripper off-gases are condensed in a horizontal submerged condenser, which is an intrinsic part of the urea reactor. In this way, two complete process steps, i.e. condensation and dehydration can be combined in one vessel. The CO2 stripper is left unchanged. However, the stripper off-gases along with the recycled carbamate solution and the ammonia feed are introduced into the pool reactor. The liquid phase is thoroughly agitated by the gases from the stripper. The heat of condensation is used for aiding the dehydration reaction and for generating steam in the tube bundle. The pressure of the generated steam controls the rate of condensation. The part of the pool reactor that is equipped with the tube bundle is the condensing part of the reactor, while the other section can be called the reaction part. The pressure at the shell side of the reactor is 140 bar, the temperature at the reactor outlet is 185 C [52, infoMil, 2001, 124, Stamicarbon, 2004].\n\nPool condenser. It is also possible to install only a pool condenser. Basically, the pool condenser is a horizontal vessel with a submerged U-tube bundle. It is fabricated from carbon steel with internals and lining in stainless steel. Strip gases are condensed in a pool of liquid on the shell side, with low pressure steam being generated on the tube side. Applying an adequate residence time allows the reaction of ammonium carbamate to urea and water to proceed up to 60 % of equilibrium. The condensation temperature on the shell side is high as a result of the formation of high boiling components of urea and water, resulting in a higher temperature differential for the exchanger. The formation of gas bubbles ensures a high degree of turbulence and provides a large area for mass and heat transfer. Both phenomena contribute to a higher heat transfer [52, infoMil, 2001, 124, Stamicarbon, 2004]. \n\nVertical submerged carbamate condenser (VSCC/ACES21). The stripped gases from the stripper are led to a vertical submerged carbamate condenser, where NH3 and CO2 condense to form ammonium carbamate and urea on its shell side. The condensation heat is recovered to generate low pressure steam on the tube side. A packed bed for scrubbing is provided at the top of the carbamate condenser to absorb uncondensed NH3 and CO2 into recycled carbamate solution (coming from the medium pressure section). Urea is partly formed in the carbamate condenser and the reaction is completed in the reactor [122, Toyo, 2002, 123, Toyo, 2003]. \n\nTechnical advantages of the combined condenser/reactor are:\n\nthe heat transfer in the reactor/condenser bundle is much better than in falling film condensers \nthe baffles in the reactor prevent back-mixing \nthe inverse response of the synthesis loop is eliminated\nthe synthesis is much less sensitive to deviations in the N/C ratio.\n\nTechnical advantages of the combined condenser/pre-reactor are:\n\nthe urea reactor volume is reduced, or the capacity of the reactor is increased accordingly \nless heat exchange area\nthe horizontal arrangement offers a structural alternative\nless stress corrosion\nhigher operational flexibility.\nAchieved environmental benefits \n\nwhen a pool reactor is used, an ammonia emission in the synthesis phase of 2.5 g/tonne product (<700 mg/m3) is achievable\nsome potential for energy saving. \n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo specific information provided. \n\n\nApplicability\n\nThe combined condenser/reactor is applicable mainly for new plants.

Fluoride is distributed between the product acid, gypsum, vapours generated in the reactor and the acid concentration section during processing. Initially, fluoride is released in the reaction as hydrogen fluoride (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)), but in the presence of silica it reacts readily to form fluosilicic acid (H2SiF6) and compounds such as MgSiF6 and H3AlF6. The fluosilicic acid may decompose with heating to give volatile silicon tetrafluoride and hydrogen fluoride.\n\nIn a dihydrate (DH) process the temperature is usually too low to cause the decomposition of fluosilicic acid. The majority of fluorine compounds will be evolved with the evaporator vapours during concentration of the weak phosphoric acid. In the hemihydrate (HH) process, most of the fluoride is released during the reaction. Fluoride leaves the reactor with the vacuum cooler condenser water or with the cooling air, depending on the cooling system used (flash cooler or air circulating cooler). To prevent fluoride emissions with condenser water, the application of an indirect condensation system may be considered instead of a direct contact condenser, thus avoiding that condenser water becoming contaminated with fluoride. A typical fluoride distribution in the dihydrate process and hemihydrate process is shown in Table   5 .70.\n\n\nTable 5.70: Typical fluoride distribution in DH and HH processes\n[31, EFMA, 2000]\n\n\nFluoride can be removed by a number of different scrubbing systems (see also Section 6.4.6). Vapours from vacuum flash coolers and vacuum evaporators are usually first led through a separator for the removal of phosphoric acid droplets that are entrained with the vapours to minimise fluosilicic acid contamination with P2O5, or something just to minimise contamination of the scrubber effluent.\n\nIf the fluorine is not recovered, the scrubber effluent will be discharged. The effluent can be neutralised with lime or limestone to precipitate fluorine as solid calcium fluoride before discharge (see also Section 6.4.9). \n\nMany companies recover the fluorine as fluosilicic acid (H2SiF6), which can be used for the production of aluminium fluoride, and other fluorine compounds such as sodium and/or potassium fluosilicates. In this case, a dilute solution of fluosilicic acid is used as the scrubbing liquid. The reaction to fluosilicic acid results in the formation of free silica. By carefully controlling the fluosilic acid strength, silica deposition is controlled. The silica is then removed by filtration. Usually, a product containing 20 - 25 % fluosilicic acid is recovered in the fluoride recovery system. \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n\nwith two or more absorbers a recovery efficiency of 99 % or more can be achieved. According to [31, EFMA, 2000], achievable fluoride emission levels for new plants are 5 mg/Nm3 (40 g/tonne P2O5). In the Netherlands, emission levels of 1 - 5 mg/Nm3 were achieved [29, RIZA, 2000]\nrecovery of fluosilicic acid (H2SiF6) with potential for valorisation (see Section 6.4.4), for production of Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) from fluosilicic acid, see Section 6.4.10.\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nWater, energy and chemicals consumption for scrubbing.\n\n\nOperational data\n\nNo information provided.\n\n\nApplicability\n\nGenerally applicable.

The aim is to reduce back to nitrogen the nitrogen oxides that have already been formed. As can be seen from Figure   3 .95, the combustion can be divided into three zones.\n\nFigure 3.95:\tThe three combustion zones and relevant parameters in a reburning process\n\n\nReburning involves combustion occurring in three zones:\n\nPrimary combustion zone (which may be equipped with primary measures): 80-85 % of the fuel is burnt in an oxidising or slightly reducing atmosphere. This primary burnout zone is necessary in order to avoid the transfer of excess oxygen into the reburning zone, which would otherwise support possible NOX formation.\nSecond combustion zone (often called the reburning zone): secondary or reburning fuel is injected into a reducing atmosphere. Hydrocarbon radicals are produced, reacting with the nitrogen oxides already formed in the primary zone; other unwanted volatile nitrogen compounds like ammonia are generated as well.\nThird combustion zone: the combustion is finally completed through the addition of final air into the burnout zone.\n\nDifferent fuels can serve as reburning fuel (pulverised coal, fuel oil, natural gas, etc.), but natural gas is generally used due to its inherent properties. Figure   3 .96 shows the advantage of natural gas over coal or oil. \n\n\nFigure 3.96:\tComparison of coal, oil and natural gas as reburning fuel\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced NOX and CO emissions to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\n\n\nTable 3.34:\tPerformance of the fuel staging (reburning) technique for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions\n\n\nThe efficiency rate of reburning depends on several parameters, including the following:\nTemperature: to obtain low NOX values, the temperature in the reburning zone should be as high as possible (1 200 degC). Figure   3 .97 shows the denitrification rate as a function of the reburning rate at different temperatures.\nResidence time: increasing the residence time in the reburning zone favours NOX reduction. An appropriate time is between 0.4 seconds and 1.5 seconds.\nAeration rate in the reburning zone: the stoichiometry should be in the range  = 0.7-0.9.\nFuel type.\nQuality of the mixing of the additional fuel and the flue-gas generated by the primary combustion zone. Natural gas usually enables homogeneous combustion, resulting in a very short residence time for burnout.\nExcess air in the primary combustion zone: the stoichiometry is approximately  = 1.1.\n\n\nFigure 3.97:\tDenitrification rate as a function of the reburning rate\n\n\nCross-media effects\nWhen using coal or oil as reburning fuel, nitrogen is present in a certain quantity, leading inevitably to NOX formation in the burnout zone. This drawback can be reduced or avoided by using natural gas.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nIn principle, the reburning technique can be implemented in all types of fossil-fuel-fired boilers and in combination with low-NOX combustion techniques (for the primary fuel). In practice, reburning is not commonly used in existing utility boilers firing liquid or gaseous fuels as primary fuels. This abatement technique, while very attractive for new boilers, necessitates large chamber volumes if high amounts of unburnt carbon are to be avoided. Therefore, reburning may be less appropriate for retrofits, due to possible space constraints in existing installations. The retrofit may be less efficient in the case of smaller plants than in larger plants.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, major problems are caused by incomplete combustion. This measure best suits boilers that have a long enough residence time and where proper reburning of fuel is available at a reasonable price. Natural gas has proven to be the best reburning fuel, mostly because it is easily flammable and does not contain particles or sulphur.\n\nCoal over coal reburning requires an ultrafine pulverising system and associated milling plant, cyclones and classifiers to achieve this fineness.\n\nEconomics\nThe costs of reburning depend on the structure of the boiler and on the fuel used. The use of auxiliary fuel, such as natural gas, also incurs costs but, on the other hand, it releases heat to the process and can therefore be considered a usable fuel. So the calculations should be made for the whole power plant economy, including possible changes, e.g. in the boiler efficiency.\n\nExperience shows that reburning is not as cost-effective as low-NOX burners with OFA, but it is still an appropriate measure for reducing NOX emissions. One estimate gives reburning costs as close to EUR 2.5 million for a 250 MWth boiler. The operating costs for reburning have also been calculated as twice as high as the costs for low-NOX burners with OFA.\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of NOX emissions.\n\nExample plants\nReburning has been installed at large power plants in the US, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy and the UK. In Italy, reburning (with oil as a reducing agent) has been implemented successfully in many large oil-fired units.\n\nReference literature\nNo information provided.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3785787_abstract", "x": 0.65164435, "y": 0.25322694, "title": "ADSORPTION DEVICE FOR COMPRESSED GAS", "year": 2021, "text": "Adsorption device for compressed gas, whereby this adsorption device (1) is provided with a vessel (2A, 2B, 25) with an inlet (3A, 3B) for the supply of a compressed gas to be treated, and an outlet (4A, 4B) for treated gas and whereby an adsorption element (19A, 19B, 19) is affixed in the aforementioned vessel (2A, 2B, 25), whereby this adsorption element (19A, 19B, 19) extends along the flow direction of the compressed gas to be treated, between the aforementioned inlet (3A, 3B) and the aforementioned outlet (4A, 4B), characterised in that the aforementioned adsorption element (19A, 19B, 19) comprises a monolithic supporting structure that is at least partially provided with a coating that contains an adsorbent.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.2.2\" title=\"Adsorption\">\n\n<content>\nAdsorption\n\nDescription\nThe removal of pollutants from a process off-gas or waste gas stream by retention on a solid surface (activated carbon is typically used as the adsorbent).

It is comparable to the operation of fabric and ceramic filters (see Section 3.5.1.4.7). The distinction is between the filter materials, the catalytic filter being loaded with a catalyst (normally a titanium/vanadium-based catalyst) that destroys pollutants by catalytical gas reaction (e.g. to oxidise dioxins and furans or to reduce NOX when ammonia or urea is injected). The catalyst is also effective at oxidising VOCs where the operating temperature is sufficiently high (> 220 degC) . The separated dust is removed and recycled/reused or disposed of separately.\n\nThe catalyst filter can consist of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, laminated to a catalytic felt substrate. It can also be made using rigid low-density ceramic filter elements (also called candles) incorporating an integral catalyst .\n\nThe catalyst is inserted into the felt substrate. The catalytic filter is installed as a module in a baghouse, shown in Figure   3 .157, in such a way that it can easily be fitted to an existing plant. \n\n\nFigure 3.157:\tCatalytic filter baghouse, including sampling trains\nWhen combined with neutralisation (with the injection, e.g. of sodium bicarbonate or lime, upstream of the catalytic filter) and adsorption systems (downstream of the ceramic and catalytic filters), catalytic filtration can be used to abate acid pollutants (e.g. HCl, SO2, HF) and heavy metals, in addition to dust, NOX and dioxins and furans (see Section 5.2.2).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with catalytic filtration are given in Table   3 .259.\n\n\nTable 3.259:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with catalytic filtration\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe separated dust possibly mixed with acid gas sorbent material is the only residue for which disposal is required. The filtered dust contains up to 90 % fewer dioxins and furans than when activated carbon is used. The dust is normally classified as non-hazardous waste.\n\nThe main utilities and consumables are given in Table   3 .260.\n\n\nTable 3.260:\tConsumables associated with catalytic filtration\n\n\nOperational data\nMonitoring \nPerformance and maintenance should be monitored carefully. The mass emission needed to assess the performance of the filter can be determined by monitoring the particulate concentration in the effluent waste gas stream, using an isokinetic sampling probe or a meter based, for example, on UV/visible opacity, beta rays or particle impingement. Catalyst activity can be monitored by testing an individual filter removed from the baghouse. If there are reasons to suspect a fall in catalytic activity, monitoring of dioxins and furans via stack sampling can be performed.\n\nTemperature and pressure drop across the bag filter need to be routinely monitored. The latter is used to indicate whether it is necessary to begin the cleaning cycle. Bag filters should be inspected regularly to identify any deterioration in the filter housing or filters. Hence access to the filter should be available.\n\nApplicability\nCatalytic filtration is used to separate particulates and eliminate hazardous contaminants from the gaseous phase. The chief contaminants this technique is applied for are dioxins and furans (PCDDs/PCDFs).

The electrical charges on the ions allow them to be driven through the membranes fabricated from ion exchange polymers. Applying a voltage between two end electrodes generates the potential field required for this. Since the membranes used in electrodialysis have the ability to selectively transport ions with positive or negative charges and reject ions of the opposite charge, useful concentration, removal, or separation of electrolytes can be achieved by electrodialysis.\n\nA schematic of the technique is shown in Figure   3 .91.\nFigure 3.91:\tElectrodialysis\n\n\nAnion-selective membranes (AM) and cation-selective membranes (CM) are placed between the anode (positive electrode) and the cathode (negative electrode). Under the influence of an electric field, anions will migrate in the direction of the anode and cations will migrate in the direction of the cathode. Anions are stopped by the CM and the cations by the AM, which creates a process flow that continues to reduce in ions (the dilutant) and a process that continues to increase in ions (the concentrate). \n\nA combination consisting of a CM, an AM and both areas between these membranes is referred to as a cell pair (see area indicated by the dotted line in Figure   3 .91). A cell pair is the basic unit of a stack, and is repeated n times (in the figure, n=8). In practice, a stack can contain hundreds of cell pairs.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nElectrodialysis allows for the removal of ions from process or waste waters and for their concentration so that they can be recycled/reused.\n\nCross-media effects\nElectrodialysis requires the use of energy as well as support substances for pretreatments (e.g. flocculants, coagulants) as well as for membrane cleaning. Regular membrane cleaning with specific cleaning products (acids, bases, etc.) may be necessary in a number of cases. The average lifespan of electrodialysis membranes is between five and seven years.\n\nOperational data\nMonitoring\nFor parameter optimisation, a pilot electrodialysis process can be set up and equipped with specific instrumentation. Such instruments should measure pressure, volume, temperature, pH and conductivity. Once conditions have been optimised for a particular application, an industrial installation can, in principle, operate independently without extensive instrumentation, once the optimised parameters have been set to within the process limits. In this regard, an electrodialysis installation offers a fairly high operational certainty provided (incidental) membrane pollution is prevented.\nApplicability\nAdvantages and disadvantages are given in Table   3 .81. \n\n\nTable 3.81:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with electrodialysis\n\n\nEconomics\nThe major costs associated with electrodialysis are membrane and electricity costs. The current density limit is a limiting factor, because this limit being reached is linked to the splitting of water, and thus results in energy loss. As a general rule of thumb, in practice, a limit of 3 000 ppm of dissolved substances is regarded as the limit between cost-effective treatment via reverse osmosis (see Section 3.3.2.3.4.7) and electrodialysis. Thus, electrodialysis is cost-effective for dissolved substances of < 3 000 ppm and reverse osmosis is cost-effective for dissolved substances of > 3 000 ppm. Another argument in favour of electrodialysis could be the need for high feed recovery. \n\nFor an electrodialysis installation which treats 10 m3 of waste water per day, originating from surface treatments in the metal industry, an investment of EUR 200 000 and operating costs of EUR 50 000 per year can be expected. Costs may vary greatly depending on the type of waste water to be treated.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force for using electrodialysis is the removal of toxic or inhibitory substances from waste waters.\n\nExample plants\nElectrodialysis is used in the food industry to demineralise milk products or sugar-related solutions. The amount of acid in fruit juice can also be reduced. In Japan, electrodialysis (combined with vaporisation) is used to prepare cooking salt from seawater.\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3656461_abstract", "x": 0.43450925, "y": 0.37298957, "title": "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR ASYMMETRIC POLARITY INVERSION IN ELECTROMEMBRANE PROCESSES", "year": 2020, "text": "Methods and circuits for a device for interrupting the concentration-related polarisation phenomenon and for the self-cleaning of electromembrane processes by application of asymmetric inverse-polarity pulses with high intensity and variable frequency are described.

Electromembrane processes can be easily updated by replacing the electrodes, suitable for polarity inversion, and adding a second power source and the bipolar switch described.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.2.3.4.8\" title=\"Electrodialysis\">\n<references_to>3.3.2.3</references_to>\n\n<content>\nElectrodialysis\n\nDescription\nElectrodialysis is an electromembrane process in which ions are transported through ion-permeable membranes from one solution to another solution under the influence of a potential gradient. The electrical charges on the ions allow them to be driven through the membranes fabricated from ion exchange polymers. Applying a voltage between two end electrodes generates the potential field required for this. Since the membranes used in electrodialysis have the ability to selectively transport ions with positive or negative charges and reject ions of the opposite charge, useful concentration, removal, or separation of electrolytes can be achieved by electrodialysis.\n\nA schematic of the technique is shown in Figure   3 .91.\nFigure 3.91:\tElectrodialysis\n\n\nAnion-selective membranes (AM) and cation-selective membranes (CM) are placed between the anode (positive electrode) and the cathode (negative electrode). Under the influence of an electric field, anions will migrate in the direction of the anode and cations will migrate in the direction of the cathode. Anions are stopped by the CM and the cations by the AM, which creates a process flow that continues to reduce in ions (the dilutant) and a process that continues to increase in ions (the concentrate). \n\nA combination consisting of a CM, an AM and both areas between these membranes is referred to as a cell pair (see area indicated by the dotted line in Figure   3 .91). A cell pair is the basic unit of a stack, and is repeated n times (in the figure, n=8). In practice, a stack can contain hundreds of cell pairs.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nElectrodialysis allows for the removal of ions from process or waste waters and for their concentration so that they can be recycled/reused.\n\nCross-media effects\nElectrodialysis requires the use of energy as well as support substances for pretreatments (e.g. flocculants, coagulants) as well as for membrane cleaning. Regular membrane cleaning with specific cleaning products (acids, bases, etc.) may be necessary in a number of cases. The average lifespan of electrodialysis membranes is between five and seven years.\n\nOperational data\nMonitoring\nFor parameter optimisation, a pilot electrodialysis process can be set up and equipped with specific instrumentation. Such instruments should measure pressure, volume, temperature, pH and conductivity. Once conditions have been optimised for a particular application, an industrial installation can, in principle, operate independently without extensive instrumentation, once the optimised parameters have been set to within the process limits. In this regard, an electrodialysis installation offers a fairly high operational certainty provided (incidental) membrane pollution is prevented.\nApplicability\nAdvantages and disadvantages are given in Table   3 .81. \n\n\nTable 3.81:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with electrodialysis\n\n\nEconomics\nThe major costs associated with electrodialysis are membrane and electricity costs. The current density limit is a limiting factor, because this limit being reached is linked to the splitting of water, and thus results in energy loss. As a general rule of thumb, in practice, a limit of 3 000 ppm of dissolved substances is regarded as the limit between cost-effective treatment via reverse osmosis (see Section 3.3.2.3.4.7) and electrodialysis. Thus, electrodialysis is cost-effective for dissolved substances of < 3 000 ppm and reverse osmosis is cost-effective for dissolved substances of > 3 000 ppm. Another argument in favour of electrodialysis could be the need for high feed recovery. \n\nFor an electrodialysis installation which treats 10 m3 of waste water per day, originating from surface treatments in the metal industry, an investment of EUR 200 000 and operating costs of EUR 50 000 per year can be expected. Costs may vary greatly depending on the type of waste water to be treated.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force for using electrodialysis is the removal of toxic or inhibitory substances from waste waters.\n\nExample plants\nElectrodialysis is used in the food industry to demineralise milk products or sugar-related solutions. The amount of acid in fruit juice can also be reduced. In Japan, electrodialysis (combined with vaporisation) is used to prepare cooking salt from seawater.\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3587438_abstract", "x": 0.54321647, "y": 0.1594398, "title": "METHOD FOR EXTRACTING PHYTOSTEROLS FROM TALL OIL PITCH", "year": 2020, "text": "The invention relates to the wood chemical industry and concerns a method for extracting phytosterols from tall oil pitch.

MBR consists of the combination of a membrane process (e.g. microfiltration or ultrafiltration) with a suspended growth bioreactor. In an MBR system for biological waste water treatment, the secondary clarifier and the tertiary filtration step of a traditional aerated sludge system is replaced by membrane filtration (the separation of sludge and suspended solids). Typical arrangements consist of vacuum-driven membrane units submerged in the aerated portion of the bioreactor or pressure-driven membrane systems located outside the bioreactor (see also Section 3.3.2.3.5.4). Membranes are typically configured hollow tube fibres or flat panels and have pore sizes ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 microns. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of the use of a membrane bioreactor include:\n\nreduction of the load of suspended solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), BOD, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Phosphorus (TP) by 95-99 %;\nreduction of the microbiological health risk to levels that comply with Directive 2006/7/EC concerning the management of bathing water quality ;\nreduction of the volume of sludge compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment;\nreduction of the plant footprint compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment, especially if tertiary filtration and a UV disinfection unit would be necessary to achieve comparable output quality.\n\nData on the environmental performance of MBRs compared to other biological treatment systems can be found in Section 3.3.2.3.5.4.\n\nCross-media effects\nCross-media effects include energy consumption (mainly for pumping and aeration), chemical consumption (for membrane cleaning) as well as membrane replacement.\n\nOperational data\nAs with other membrane separation processes, membrane fouling is the most serious problem affecting the performance of MBR systems. Fouling leads to a significant increase in hydraulic resistance, manifested as permeate flux decline or transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase when the process is operated under constant TMP or constant flux conditions, respectively.\n\nFrequent membrane cleaning and replacement is therefore required, increasing the operating costs significantly. Membrane fouling results from an interaction between the membrane material and the components of the activated sludge liquor, which include biological flocs formed by a large range of living microorganisms along with soluble and colloidal compounds. Although different membrane manufacturers use different techniques to control fouling, the primary method to address fouling is aeration along with periodic chemical cleaning. Membrane aeration to control fouling was reported to account for 35 % to 40 % of the total power consumption of an MBR .\n\nMBR is key to the central biological waste water treatment in the Roche Diagnostics GmbH chemical plant in Penzberg, Germany. The plant produces biopharmaceutical ingredients using biological processes . The central biological waste water treatment consists of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: high-performance activated sludge treatment of highly polluted waste water from production plants after balancing the concentration (aeration system using refined oxygen).\n\nStep 2: activated sludge treatment of waste water from production plants (after neutralisation) plus effluents from Step 1, plus sanitary waste water after mechanical treatment (screening). Step 2 consists of six aeration tanks operated as a biological cascade; the last tank is designed as a membrane bioreactor.\n\nThe plant has a treatment capacity of 3 800 m3/d and can treat 4 800 kg BOD5/d. The average waste water flow treated in 2007 was 1 366 m3/d.

The plant in Aramon produces a large range of pharmaceutical products and has two MBRs in parallel, each having a volume of 3 600 m3.

When the waste water is subjected to a current, the electrons are exchanged between the electrodes and the liquid. As a result, metal ions present in the waste water deposit on the cathode. The purified waste water then leaves the electrolysis cell and in many cases is reused. The efficiency of the technique can be improved by separating the cathode and the anode sections by the use of a membrane composed of a high charge density polymer. Therefore, the anion or the cation can be made selective by altering the charge of the membrane. As a result, this separation allows the conditions surrounding the electrodes to be individually optimised (e.g. pH correction), thus avoiding after-effects and increasing yields. \n\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nElectrolysis allows for the removal of metal ions from process waters and/or waste waters and allows for the concentration of these metals so that they can be recycled/reused.\n\nCross-media effects\nHigh consumption of energy when low final concentrations are required. Hydrogen gas and chlorine gas may form on the electrodes in the presence of (hydrochloric) acid. Side reactions such as the formation of gases and formation of HCN in cyanide must be prevented by pH correction. \n\nOperational data\nThe ideal pH is determined by each application. Acids can be used to modify the pH in order to avoid the formation of metal hydroxides before metals deposit on the electrodes. Leach solution is used to prevent formation of hydrogen gas from hydrogen ions The retention period in the electrolysis cell is between five and thirty minutes. \n\nThe purification yield is very high and final metal ion concentrations of less than 0.1 mg/l are achievable. However, in order to achieve these levels, reactors with improved mass transfer and/or with high specific surface area should be used. When recuperating Pd and Ni from Pd-Ni alloy baths, the concentration of both metals is reduced to 20 mg/l.

It combines permeation and vaporisation. Pervaporation employs both a concentration gradient and pressure as driving forces for separation. Volatile organic compounds are removed from a liquid feed solution through a semi-permeable membrane into the gas phase. The separation of the compounds from a liquid mixture is determined not only by differences in their vapour pressure but also by their permeation rates through the membrane. The driving force for permeation is the chemical potential difference of the compounds between the two phases separated by the membrane.\n\nA vacuum is kept on the permeate side of the membrane while the feed side of the membrane is kept at atmospheric or elevated pressure so a pressure difference is created over the membrane which is the driving force for the pervaporation process. The compound(s) that permeates through the membrane evaporates while passing through the membrane because the partial pressure of the permeating compound(s) is kept lower than the equilibrium vapour pressure. In most cases, the permeate is recondensed.\n\nA schematic of the technique is shown in Figure   3 .94.\nFigure 3.94:\tPervaporation \n\n\nThere are different types of membranes for pervaporation: organic membranes, also called polymeric membranes, and inorganic membranes, also called ceramic membranes. A major drawback of polymeric membranes is their limited solvent and temperature stability. Generally, ceramic membranes are solvent and temperature stable, can be used in a broad pH range and have both high selectivity and permeability. \n\nThe pervaporation process, according to the widely accepted sorption-diffusion model, consists of three consecutive steps:\n\nspecific sorption in the membrane layer of one or more compounds in the feed mixture depending on the characteristics of the membrane;\ndiffusion of the compounds through the membrane;\ndesorption of the compounds on the permeate-side as vapour. \n\nPervaporation is not based on a liquid/vapour balance like distillation, but is based on differences in sorption and diffusion of the various compounds in the feed. Thus, it is an interesting alternative for separating azeotropic mixes, which have the same composition in the vapour and the liquid phase, or mixes with similar boiling points. Furthermore, it offers an energy advantage because only the permeating compound must be converted into the gas phase. \n\nThere is also an alternative process, referred to as vapour permeation. Vapour permeation involves the feed being introduced in vapour form before it comes into contact with the membrane. This alternative is particularly interesting if the feed comes from an earlier process step in vapour form.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn removal of volatile organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons and BTEX) from waste water, pervaporation is competitive with active carbon adsorption and stripping. Pervaporation easily removes compounds from water to levels below 1 %. Higher concentrate purification levels are possible but require a relatively large membrane surface, because the encountered fluxes are relatively low (low driving force) . \n\nCross-media effects\nThe technique has the potential to save energy at a rate above 50 % compared to distillation. If the correct pretreatment is implemented (e.g. microfiltration) in the presence of suspended matter, and if a vapour permeation process is used for the presence of salts, then no problems are expected during membrane cleaning - thus no chemicals are needed.\n\n\n\nOperational data\nIn order to have sufficient flux during pervaporation, work is normally carried out at temperatures between 50 degC and 100 degC. Typical fluxes averaged for a pervaporation process are around 1 kg/(m2xh). Pervaporation is a relatively simple process. The parameters for process optimisation are temperature, vacuum, feed rate and feed concentration.\n\nApplicability\nPervaporation/vapour permeation is a practical and financially viable alternative to distillation when draining solvents, particularly where azeotropes must be degraded or liquids with similar boiling points must be separated. In such cases, a hybrid process (distillation combined with pervaporation) is normally the most economically viable solution.\n\nHydrophilic pervaporation or vapour permeation can also be used to remove water from a reaction mixture and thus favourably alter the reaction balance. This is, for example, used for esterification reactions.\n\nPervaporation should be implemented to remove the minority compound(s) from a mixture. In this case, the required membrane surface and required energy will be at their lowest. Most pervaporation membranes work optimally when the permeating compounds in the feed are below a particular maximum level. Compounds with high boiling points make pervaporation more difficult. They restrict selectivity and can block the membrane. \n\nEconomics\nA theoretical economic evaluation of a hybrid distillation/pervaporation unit for a to-be-processed isopropanol/water mix (50/50 wt%) by Van Hoof et al. (2004) resulted in the following costs both with polymeric and ceramic membranes (lower costs with ceramic membranes):\n\noperating costs (primarily energy): ~ EUR 17/t product;\ninvestment costs: ~ EUR 40/t product;\nmaintenance (including membrane replacement): ~ EUR 13/t product.\n\nThus the costs, for draining solvents that form an azeotrope, using such a hybrid distillation/pervaporation process, are around half of those associated with 'classic' azeotropic distillation. \n\nConsidering the limited implementation, no investment costs can be mentioned for a full-scale installation.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force for implementation compared to more classic technologies such as distillation is the significant energy savings.\n\nExample plants\nThroughout the world, there are various large-scale implementations, with the majority addressing drainage of alcohol (ethanol and isopropanol). The capacity of most installations lies between 50 l/d and 300 l/d. Thus, these are rather small installations.\n\nExamples of sectors where pervaporation can be implemented are the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the petrochemical sector, refineries and paint, gloss, and varnish or printing-ink production.\n\nReference literature\n \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3865606_abstract", "x": 0.42831174, "y": 0.37207177, "title": "WATER ELECTROLYSIS DEVICE", "year": 2021, "text": "A water electrolysis device for generating hydrogen gas includes a case, a power supplying unit, and an ion-exchange membrane electrolyzer.

It also acts as a collector for backwash water.\n\nIon exchangers commonly in use are macroporous granule resins with cationic or anionic functional groups, such as:\n\nstrong acid cation exchangers, neutralising strong bases and converting neutral salts into their corresponding acids;\nweak acid cation exchangers, able to neutralise strong bases and used for dealkalisation;\nstrong base anion exchangers, neutralising strong acids and converting neutral salts into their corresponding bases;\nweak base anion exchangers, neutralising strong acids and used for partial demineralisation.\n\nThe ion exchange operation cycle is comprised of:\n\nthe actual ion exchange operation;\nthe backwash stage, including removal of accumulated particles and reclassification of the ion exchange resin bed;\nthe regeneration stage, using a low volume/high concentration solution, reloading the ion exchange resin with the respective ion, and releasing the unwanted ion species to the regeneration solution;\nthe displacement, or rinse with a slow water flow, of the regeneration solution through the bed;\nthe fast rinse, removing the remaining traces of the regeneration solution, including any residual hardness, from the resin bed.\n\nStorage facilities for the regeneration chemicals are necessary.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nTypical effluent ion concentrations that can be achieved are in the range of 0.1-10 mg/l with influent concentrations of 10-1 000 mg/l.\nAchieved environmental benefits associated with ion exchange are given in Table   3 .89.\n\n\nTable 3.89:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with ion exchange\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe regeneration of ion exchange resins results in a small volume of concentrated acid or salt solution, which contains the removed ions originating from the resin. This enriched liquid has to be treated separately to remove these ions, e.g. heavy metals by precipitation.\n\nThe rinsing water from regeneration contains the same ions as the brine, but in relatively low concentrations. Whether this part can be discharged directly or has to undergo treatment depends on the actual concentrations. At a plant in Germany, the rinsing water from regeneration is reused in waste gas scrubbers.\n\nIon exchange implies the consumption of ion exchange resins, regeneration liquids, water for backwashing and rinsing, and energy for the pumps. The addition of other chemicals, e.g. to suppress microbiological fouling, may be necessary.\n\nSources of noise are the pumps, which can be enclosed.\n\nOperational data\nMonitoring\nInfluent and effluent of the ion exchange vessel have to be carefully monitored for the occurrence of breakthrough. The parameters that need to be controlled are:\n\npressure drop;\nelectrical conductivity;\npH;\neffluent concentration of the relevant ion(s).\n\nApplicability \nIon exchange is applied to remove unwanted ionic and ionisable species from waste water, such as:\n\nheavy metal ions, cationic or anionic, e.g. Cr3+ or cadmium and its compounds, with low feed concentrations, CrO42- also with high feed concentrations;\nionisable inorganic compounds, such as H3BO3;\nsoluble, ionic or ionisable organic compounds, e.g. carboxylic acids, sulphonic acids, some phenols, amines as acid salt, quaternary amines, alkyl sulphates, can be removed.\n\nIon exchange is feasible as an end-of-pipe treatment, but its greatest value lies in its recovery potential. It is commonly used as an integrated operation in waste water treatment, e.g. to recover rinse water and process chemicals. Typical influent concentrations are between 10 mg/l and 1 000 mg/l.

Differential absorption LIDAR (DIAL) method\nThe DIAL method can target one or two species at a time. It can be used to estimate Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) concentrations in general by targeting a generic wavelength that is representative of the carbon-hydrogen bond within the species of interest. This generic measurement will yield information on C2 to C8 compounds. \n\nDIAL systems have both an infrared and an ultraviolet component. The infrared DIAL is used primarily for alkanes although it can identify most species with absorption in the infrared spectral region between 2.5 um and 4 um - including, for example, hydrogen chloride, nitrous oxide, and methanol. Limits of detection for the alkanes are in the 10-50 ppb range at distances up to about 800 metres. The UV/Visible DIAL can identify and specify benzene, toluene, and xylenes in the 10-20 ppb range and can also be used for measuring elemental mercury, ozone, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen monoxide. \n\nLimits of detection are very dependent upon site conditions at the time of measurement. During a verification project done by the UK National Physical Laboratory, it was reported that the DIAL measurements for a known methane release were within +-10 % of the true values. In other experiments, the DIAL measurements were within +-12 % of the true value of an aliphatic hydrocarbon plume and within +-15 % of a toluene plume . To obtain mass emission fluxes, the concentration data across the plume section are multiplied by the wind velocity perpendicular to the measurement plane. Wind data availability, accuracy and representativeness are essential for reducing measurement uncertainties. The overall uncertainty in industrial field conditions is evaluated at around 30-50 %, most of it originating from wind speed evaluation .\n\nThe DIAL method may provide a conservative estimate because it does not necessarily capture the whole plume. Nonetheless, DIAL studies of 100-plus facilities executed under different climatic, environmental, and operating conditions all show that the facility has higher emissions than are reported .\n\n2. Solar occultation flux (Solar Occultation Flux (SOF)) method\nThe solar occultation flux (Solar Occultation Flux (SOF)) method uses a passive FTIR system mounted in a truck. This method measures olefins and alkanes, but not aromatics. Also, some other restrictions exist on the range of hydrocarbons that can be measured, i.e. those heavier than C8 to C10. Its use is limited to sunny days, and the wind must blow in the same direction for a long period of time. \n\nThe overall uncertainty for quantification in industrial field conditions is evaluated at around 35-40 %. Most of it originates from wind (speed and direction) evaluation uncertainty and retrieval uncertainty (combined effect of instrumentation and retrieval stability on the retrieved total columns during the course of a plume transect).\n\nWhile each approach is different, the DIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) methods both produce roughly equivalent emission estimates. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe facilitation of the prevention and reduction of diffuse Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone.\n\n\nOperational data\nIn Sweden, both DIAL (until 1988, once every three years) and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) (after 1998) methods have been used to make site level assessments at petrochemical installations.\n\nApplicability\nApplicable to all petrochemical sites. \n\nDIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) can be used for the overall quantification of diffuse Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, but they show limitations in the accuracy of the localisation of specific emission sources  .\nThe commercial availability of DIAL and Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) is limited in some EU Member States.\n\nEconomics\nDepending upon the size of the site, a typical DIAL survey cost is reported to be between EUR 75 000 and EUR 150 000 (actual cost between USD 100 000 and USD 200 000, average currency conversion rate for 2010: EUR/USD = 1.329). \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for implementation include:\n\nenvironmental legislation;\nreduction in material losses;\nhealth and safety for employees.\n\nExample plants\nPetrochemical installations and refineries in Sweden.\n\nReference literature\n      \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3608011_abstract", "x": 0.63507146, "y": 0.35515606, "title": "SPIRAL-TYPE GAS-SEPARATION MEMBRANE ELEMENT, GAS-SEPARATION MEMBRANE MODULE, AND GAS-SEPARATION DEVICE", "year": 2020, "text": "Provided are a spiral-wound gas separation membrane element, a manufacturing method therefor, a gas separation membrane module and a gas separation apparatus that include the element.

Organic vapours have a considerably higher permeation rate than oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen or carbon dioxide (10 to 100 times higher). The waste gas stream is compressed and passed over the membrane. The enriched permeate can be recovered by methods such as condensation (see Section 3.5.1.2.2) or adsorption (see Section 3.5.1.2.3), or it can be abated, e.g. by catalytic oxidation (see Section 3.5.1.3.6). The process is most appropriate for higher vapour concentrations.

The process is shown in Figure   3 .135.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.135:\tFlow sheet of the biotrickling process\n\n\nIn a biological trickle-bed reactor, an aqueous phase is continuously circulated through a bed of inert material. This packing can consist of irregular bulk material, such as rings, saddles, etc. or of structured packing. When selecting the packing material, it is necessary in every single case to ensure that, even in the event of an anticipated excess sludge formation, the reactor will not become choked in the long term. The surface properties should be such that the biofilm adheres to it firmly. The pollutants in the waste gas and the oxygen are absorbed by the water phase and transported to the biofilm, where the biological transformation takes place. The quality of the mass transfer from the gas to the liquid phase and the elimination performance of the reactor essentially depend on the wetted surface area of the packing. In order to achieve optimum elimination results, i.e. to maximise the wetted surface area, the liquid phase should be distributed uniformly over the surface of the biofilm .\n\nThe immobilisation of the biomass and the formation of the biofilm are generally a naturally controlled process which starts after inoculation of the water phase. The continuously circulating liquid phase takes on the function of supplying the microbe population with the necessary nutrients. At the same time, excess activated sludge and reaction products which can also be inhibitors, e.g. hydrogen chloride during the degradation of dichloromethane, are washed out of the reactor. In the liquid phase, the essential conditions such as pH, nutrients and salt accumulation need to be controlled .\n\nAs with bioscrubbing, an increase in the salt content of the absorbent takes place. Measures to prevent excessive salt formation include:\n\nadequate removal of the absorbent and simultaneous addition of fresh water;\noperation with softened water;\nvapour saturation of the upstream waste gas.\n\nA biotrickling facility is illustrated in Figure   3 .136.\n\n\nFigure 3.136:\tTypical biotrickling facility \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with biotrickling are given in Table   3 .195.\n\nTable 3.195:\tAbatement efficiencies and emission levels associated with biotrickling\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe main utilities and consumables are given in Table   3 .196.\n\n\nTable 3.196:\tConsumables associated with biotrickling\n\n\nBecause of biological activities in the biotrickler, the salt concentration in the circulation water increases and thus should be discharged from time to time. This waste water effluent should be treated or disposed of in some other way.\n\nSurplus activated sludge has to be disposed of, depending on the contaminants or degradation products, e.g. by incineration.\n\nOdour might occasionally arise from the tanks storing the circulation water, in such cases collection of exhaust air and its treatment is advised.\n\nOperational data\nDesign and maintenance\nThe handling of the biological film layer (biofilm) of the packing is essential: too much growth can lead to (local) clogging that finally results in preferential streams, causing the size of the exchange surface and thus the performance of the biotrickling filter to worsen. The growth and thickness of the biofilm can be controlled by adjusting the thickness with mechanics (like varying the humidification) or by adjusting the growth of the microorganisms by varying the degree of acidity and/or the salt content. In biotrickling filters that process high H2S concentrations, there is a chance of elementary sulphur forming because of incomplete biological oxidation. This can be recognised by the yellow granular textures and can eventually lead to clogging and preferential currents. Biotrickling filters that process high concentrations of inorganic compounds (e.g. NH3 or H2S) usually have microorganisms that use CO2 from the air as a source of carbon. Given the relatively high concentrations of CO2 in the air, extra precautions should be taken to avoid excessive growth of the biofilm.\n\nMonitoring\nThe effectiveness of the biotrickling system is determined by the gas feed and outlet concentrations. The composition of the absorbing water should be monitored by continuous measuring of the parameters .\n\nApplicability\nThe application of biotrickling is comparable to that of bioscrubbing. Slight differences are found in the pollutant compounds for which both treatment techniques are suitable. \n\nThe applicability of biotrickling to different compound groups is given in Table   3 .197 (compare with the corresponding table in Section 3.5.1.3.2).\n\n\nTable 3.197:\tApplicability of biotrickling to compound groups\nApplication limits and restrictions are given in Table   3 .198.\n\n\nTable 3.198:\tApplication limits and restrictions associated with biotrickling\n\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages are given in Table   3 .199. \n\n\nTable 3.199:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with biotrickling\n\n\nEconomics\nEconomics associated with biotrickling are given in Table   3 .200.\n\n\nTable 3.200:\tEconomics associated with biotrickling\nDriving force for implementation\nBiotrickling is used to abate low concentrations of pollutants that are easily soluble in water and readily biodegradable.\n\nExample plants\nThe technique is reported to be used in the (petro)chemical industry as well as in other sectors such as waste water treatment plants (for H2S abatement), the textile industry, the tobacco industry (to abate odours), printer shops, the wood processing industry, the metal processing industry (to abate Non-methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC)), the food industry, sludge-processing installations, waste-processing installations, and sewerage water pumping stations.\n\nReference literature\n \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3885687_abstract", "x": 0.80916685, "y": 0.2930514, "title": "COOLING TOWER WITH INDIRECT HEAT EXCHANGER", "year": 2021, "text": "A heat exchange apparatus is provided with an indirect evaporative heat exchange section and a direct evaporative heat exchange section.

The waste gas from the smokeless process phases, which does not require emission abatement, is not treated. The system is regarded as a robust waste gas treatment requiring little maintenance.\n\nThe thermal oxidiser is heated to its operating temperature before the smoke generators are operated. During smoking, the exhaust gas fan force-feeds the smoke-laden waste gas through a waste gas bypass flap to a preheater. Here, the dirty gas is heated to 300-350 degC before it enters the combustion chamber, where it is mixed with the hot gases from the gas burner. After treatment, the clean gas is used to preheat the dirty gas by using an integrated heat exchanger and it is cooled to 400-450 degC before it is discharged to air via a flue stack.\n\nTable   7 .118 shows technical data for direct flame thermal oxidation in the example smokehouse. A flow diagram of the origin and process management of hot gas from this smokehouse is illustrated in Figure   7 .128.\n\n\nTable 7.118:\tTechnical data of a direct flame thermal oxidiser applied in a smokehouse\n\nFigure 7.128:\tFlow diagram showing the origin and process management of the hot gas from the waste gas cleaning system of a smokehouse\n\n\n\nIn the example smokehouse, all smoke units, regardless of their size, are equipped with a smoke generator. The smoking intensity is determined by the smoking time which is approximately 60-120 minutes/batch. The flow rate for one smoke generator is 200 Nm3/h, resulting in a total flow rate for 11 smoke chambers of approximately 2 300 Nm3/h. Applying a realistic parallel operating factor of 75 %, the actual flow rate is 1 650 Nm3/h. Table   7 .119 shows technical data for the direct flame thermal oxidiser used.\n\n\nTable 7.119:\tTechnical data for a direct flame thermal oxidiser applied in a smokehouse\t\n\n\nIt is reported that at 620-660 degC, complete removal of odour emissions is achieved and, as a general rule, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is emitted at an unspecified level below 50 mg/Nm3.

Air pollutants are absorbed in the liquid phase and subsequently degraded by microorganisms settling on the filter elements.\n\nTechnical description\nBioscrubbers (or biotrickling filters) are absorbers in which an intensive exchange of substances takes place between the polluted gas and the absorbent. The microorganisms are either finely divided in the collecting liquid or applied as a layer to the absorber structures or trickling filter. The absorber is followed by a mist collector to separate the gaseous and liquid phases. In the subsequent absorbent regeneration step, the waste gas constituents absorbed in the liquid phase are removed from the absorbent. For waste gases with high particulate emission levels, the gas needs to be passed through a dust remover before the bioscrubber.\n\nThe technique essentially comprises a packed bed absorber containing a bacterial population within the packing and the sump. The contaminated gas is passed up the tower against a flow of water containing a population of bacteria. The bacteria attaches itself to the packing in a similar manner to a trickling filter used for waste water treatment (see Section 2.3.6.2.1.5). Nutrients, required for bacterial growth and synthesis, are added to the absorber sump on a periodic basis.\n\nThe speed of biodegradation is relatively slow, thus operating conditions may have a crucial role. A bioscrubber operates at a typical residence time of 5-15 seconds, depending on the airstream to be treated. Bioscrubbers require a much smaller land area than biofilters. A typical layout of a bioscrubber installation is shown in Figure   2 .49.\n\n\nFigure 2.49:\tBioscrubber layout\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced emissions to air, mainly odour, TVOC, SO2 and dust.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe size of a bioscrubber is not restricted by the airflow to be treated, although the resultant size of a single packed tower may necessitate two parallel systems. A limit to the maximum concentration of contaminants in the inlet airstream is generally documented as less than 5 000 mg/Nm3, although a concentration limit of 1 000 mg/Nm3 may be used as a guideline when assessing the suitability of bioscrubbing .\n\nMore environmental performance and operational data are presented in the related FDM sectorial chapters.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe bioscrubber is more energy-intensive than the biofilter as water is being recirculated in addition to the air movement. Disposal of the filter material.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nUsed to eliminate biodegradable gaseous air pollutants, especially organic pollutants and odours. In theory, a bioscrubber can be used wherever bio-oxidation is an appropriate solution to an emission problem and its applications are, therefore, similar to those of biofilters; however, biofilters are more widely applied.

Two variants are used: a) an external recirculation loop between the activated sludge tank and the membrane module; and b) immersion of the membrane module in the aerated activated sludge tank, where the effluent is filtered through a hollow fibre membrane, with the biomass remaining in the tank.\n\nTechnical description\nA MBR is a variation on a conventional activated sludge treatment whereby a number of membrane modules, or cartridges, replace the secondary clarifier and the tertiary filtration step (see Figure   2 .15). Following biological treatment, the mixed liquor is pumped under static head pressure to the membrane unit where the solids and liquids are separated, the clean waste water is discharged, and the concentrated mixed liquor is pumped back to the bioreactor. \n\nThe MBR can be operated in either aerobic or anaerobic mode, thereby increasing the range of suitable chemicals, e.g. used for membrane cleaning in biological treatment. Typical arrangements consist of vacuum-driven membrane units submerged in the aerated part of the bioreactor or pressure-driven membrane systems located outside the bioreactor. Membranes are typically configured hollow tube fibres or flat panels and have pore sizes ranging from 0.1 microns to 0.4 microns.\n\n\nFigure 2.15:\tSimplified process flow diagram of the MBR system\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achieved environmental benefits of the use of a membrane bioreactor include :\n\nreduction of the load of suspended solids, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC), BOD, and Total Phosphorous (TP) by 95-99 %;\nreduction of the microbiological health risk to levels that comply with Directive 2006/7/EC concerning the management of bathing water quality;\nreduction of the volume of sludge compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment;\nreduction of the plant footprint compared to conventional aerated sludge treatment, especially if tertiary filtration and a UV disinfection unit are necessary to achieve comparable output quality.\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nA MBR operates across a range of loading rates, but can achieve a higher treatment rate in a number of ways, i.e. increased static pressure increases the amount of dissolved oxygen thereby aiding mass transfer; using oxygen instead of air; and using a multistage system to optimise the process. For oil and grease applications, concentrations of BOD in the waste water may be reduced to less than 15 mg/l.\n\nA MBR provides highly efficient biomass separation, allowing the biomass concentration within the upstream reactor to be up to 10 times greater than the concentration normally attainable in a conventional suspended growth system. When using a MBR, no secondary sedimentation is required and:\n\nvery broad MLSS levels can be achieved in the bioreactor, i.e. 12-17 000 mg/l;\nvery low Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) emission levels can be achieved after treatment; the dairy installation #409 reported emission levels in the range of 2-4 mg Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/l and 4.6-11 mg Total Suspended Solids (TSS)/l as yearly averages .\n\nThe energy consumption, for pumping, might be significantly higher than in conventional activated sludge processes but it can be minimised by applying gravity feed to the waste water. An example dairy in Ireland treats 9 000 m3 of waste water per day to high standards for discharge to a local watercourse, applying gravity feed to make the process low-energy-intensive. The dairy installation #409 reported an energy consumption of 2.6-3.2 kWh/m3 of waste water treated when applying ultrafiltration almost continuously, and reverse osmosis to reuse waste water in the CIP process when needed.\nFouling of the membranes may be a major problem. Aeration and backwashing are used to control this problem, which may result in additional waste water being produced. Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) (see Section 2.3.6.5.4) is used to scour and clean the membrane surfaces to prevent biofouling.\n\nCross-media effects\nCross-media effects include energy consumption (mainly for pumping and aeration) and chemical consumption (for membrane cleaning), as well as membrane replacement.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nA MBR is applicable in all FDM installations. This technique has the advantage of having low space requirements. This system is ideal for higher-pollutant-load, lower-volume waste water. It is especially attractive in situations where a long solids retention time is required to achieve the necessary biological degradation of the pollutants. Furthermore, waste water containing not readily degradable compounds, e.g. phenols, pesticides, herbicides and chlorinated solvents, and high organic pollution can be treated with a MBR. Advantages and disadvantages compared to the conventional activated sludge process are given in Table   2 .60.\nTable 2.60:\tAdvantages and disadvantages associated with membrane bioreactors \n\n\nEconomics\nHigh energy costs, although the operating costs are comparable to or lower than an alternative aerobic waste water treatment with similar emission levels to those obtained by a MBR.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nPossibility to reuse the water and therefore reduced costs.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique has been reported in several FDM installations belonging to the dairy, fruit and vegetable, and oilseed processing and refining sectors .

The activated sludge mixture is sent to a separation facility from where the sludge is recycled to the aeration tank..\n\nTechnical description\nThe activated sludge technique produces an activated mass of microorganisms capable of stabilising a waste aerobically. The general arrangement of an activated sludge process for removing carbonaceous matter includes the following items:\n\naeration tank where air (or oxygen or a combination of the two) is injected into the mixed liquor;\nsettling tank (usually referred to as the final clarifier or secondary settling tank) to allow the biological flocs to settle, thus separating the biological sludge from the clear treated water.\n\nTreatment of nitrogenous matter involves additional steps where the mixed liquor is left in an anoxic condition (see Section 2.3.6.3.1).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced BOD, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) or Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), phosphorus and nitrogen emission levels. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nAfter a given residence time, which can vary from several hours to an excess of 10 days, based on an organic loading rate or F/M ratio of about 0.1-0.15 kg BOD/kg of MLSS per day, the mixed suspension of microorganisms is passed to a sedimentation facility (see Section 2.3.6.5.2) The hydraulic retention time or sludge age and F/M ratio can all vary as a function of the raw waste water characteristics, e.g. composition, availability and degradability of organic substances, and the required final waste water quality. For example, nitrification occurs with lower (< 0.1 kg BOD/kg of MLSS per day) F/M ratios. In the sedimentation facility, the settlement of microbial flocs occurs and clear waste water is passed over a weir to a watercourse. Settled sludge is produced and mostly returned to the aeration tank. However, a proportion, i.e. the excess sludge, is wasted to maintain MLSS at a reasonable level, e.g. 3 000 mg/l .\nThe performance data of an activated sludge WWTP in the brewery sector is shown in Table   2 .56.\n\n\nTable 2.56:\tPerformance data of an activated sludge WWTP reported for the brewing sector\n\n\nPhosphorus removal efficiencies of 20-30 % have been reported using activated sludge .\n\nIn the sugar sector, it has been reported that low winter air and water temperatures depress the treatment capacity as bacterial activity is reduced. However, low-grade waste heat from the sugar process can usually be used to increase temperatures in the system and enhance bacterial activity.\n\nThe most common problem associated with activated sludge is that of bulking. This term is used to describe biological sludge of poor settling characteristics. It is generally due to the presence of filamentous bacteria and/or excessive water bound within biological flocs. Bulking can be prevented by, for example, ensuring that the optimum balance of added nutrients is maintained, minimising both the release of nutrients and the overproduction of filamentous bacteria. In addition, the use of a separate compartment or selector has been recognised as a good tool to prevent and control filamentous growth. This is an initial contact zone where the primary waste water and the returned sludge are combined. \n\nIn the dairy sector, sludge bulking has been reported in activated sludge systems with fluctuating loads and low F/M ratios, e.g. insufficient BOD. If a selector is not used, the final sedimentation needs to be designed according to the inferior sludge settling characteristics.\n\nTo ensure that the activated sludge has enough nutrients, phosphoric acid and/or urea may be added to the influent in the event that the concentration of Total Phosphorous (TP) and/or Total Nitrogen (TN) is too low.\n\nCross-media effects\nThese include high energy consumption for aeration combined with mixing in the aeration tank. Installation #466 reported an energy use of approximately 2.2 kWh/kg of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) . Volatile waste water content can be released into the atmosphere, giving rise to odour. Aerobic biological treatment produces a relatively large amount of excess activated sludge that needs to be disposed of.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nWidely used in the FDM sector. The technique can be used to treat high- or low-BOD waste water, but will treat low-BOD water highly efficiently and cost-effectively. \n\nEconomics\nThe activated sludge technique provides a cost-effective treatment of soluble organic matter.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCompliance with legal requirements to limit pollution to a receiving water body.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique is widely used in FDM installations .\nReference literature\n, , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3342291_abstract", "x": 0.724527, "y": 0.34193033, "title": "SMOKING DEVICE", "year": 2018, "text": "Smoking device (10) includes smoking chamber (14), smoke generating chamber (16), smoking heater (28), communication path (30), and fan (32).
