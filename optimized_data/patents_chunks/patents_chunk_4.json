Filling and breathing losses are greatly diminished in comparison with fixed roof tanks, but the following vapour losses are inherent to this type of tank:\nstanding storage emissions from floating roof tanks include rim seal and roof-fitting emissions, which result from stock vapour pressure changes due to temperature, and pressure variations but more importantly wind effects as well as openings in the roof. The influence of wind effects is not a factor on internal floating roof tanks. Standing emissions on external floating roof tanks are generally much more significant than withdrawal emissions\nwetting losses; by evaporation of liquid from the wet wall, when the level of the liquid is lowered by discharge\nvapours released during water draining\nin many cases, for an external floating roof tank, the emissions through fittings can exceed the rim seal losses especially on tanks with secondary seals. In terms of fitting losses, the major source is from the slotted stillwell (sample well or dipping well).\nExternal floating roof tanks are used to store crudes, light products and intermediate stocks having a vapour pressure of more than 14kPa but less than 86 kPa at normal storage temperature. More information can be found in Section 2.21. Techniques to minimise emissions there include:\ninstalling wipers at the floating deck\nsleeves around the pipe, incorporating still well wipers\nfloats with wipers inside the slotted pipe\nland as infrequently as possible the floating roof tanks to avoid unnecesary vapour releases.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nFor the same substance, e.g. gasoline, EFRTs have the advantage over fixed roof tanks of significantly lower emissions to the atmosphere of VOCs. An External Floating Roof Tanks (EFRT) can avoid 95 % of the losses from a fixed roof. Product savings give operating benefits.\n\nCross-media effects\nThey have potentially more emissions to water than fixed roof tanks, since it is possible for rainwater to enter the tank past the roof seal. Any such water needs to be drained before despatch of the product to a customer since the quality of the product can be seriously jeopardised.  \n\nOperational data\nPerformance data on emissions and other useful information about External Floating Roof Tanks (EFRT) are available in [323, API, 1997].\n\nApplicability\nIn retrofit situations where a change in the service of the tank is desired, an acceptable alternative to an External Floating Roof Tanks (EFRT) is to retrofit a fixed roof tank with an internal floating cover. \n\nEconomics\nInvestment cost for the retrofitting of a fixed rood tank to a External Floating Roof Tanks (EFRT) is EUR 0.26 million per tank diameter 20 m. Operator is necessary for tank draining, giving rise to some operating cost. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe Directive 94/63/EC (Annex 1) defines an appropriate floating roof tank as one having at least a Volatile Organic Carbons (VOC) release efficiency of 95 % as compared with a fixed roof one. \n\nReference literature\n[45, Sema and Sofres, 1991], [252, CONCAWE, 2000], [258, Manduzio, 2000], [323, API, 1997], [268, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3173140_abstract", "x": 0.6059051, "y": 0.327325, "title": "WATER TREATMENT DEVICE AND OPERATING METHOD FOR SAME", "year": 2017, "text": "A water treatment device is provided with: a sub-reverse osmosis membrane device (80S) having a primary casing (81) and a primary reverse osmosis membrane (86s) dividing the inside of the primary casing into a primary liquid passing part (91s) and a primary permeation part (92s); a low pressure water feed pump (11) for pressure feeding seawater (SW) to the primary liquid passing part (91s) at a pressure lower than or equal to the osmotic pressure of the seawater; a main reverse osmosis membrane device (80M) having a secondary casing (81) and a secondary reverse osmosis membrane (86m) dividing the inside of the secondary casing into a secondary liquid passing part (91m) and a secondary permeation part (92m); and a high pressure water feed pump (71) for pressure feeding primary treated liquid (W1), which is the resulting product of seawater passing through the primary liquid passing pan (91s) and flowing out of the primary liquid passing part (91s), to the secondary liquid passing part (91m) at a pressure higher than the osmotic pressure of the primary treated liquid (W1).", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.5.10.5\" title=\"Seawater scrubbing\">\n<references_to>4.23.5.4</references_to>\n\n<content>\nSeawater scrubbing\n\nDescription\nThis scrubbing uses the natural alkalinity of the seawater to remove SO2. More information can be found in Section 4.23.5.4.\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSO2 recovery can be as high as 99 %. In order to reduce the particulate emissions to the seawater, a particulate abatement technique should be included before the flue gas is treated in the seawater scrubber. In this way, seawater scrubbing can be seen as a transfer of the remaining pollution from air to seawater.\n\nCross-media effects\nParticulates containing metals (e.g. V, Ni, Sb) and other pollutants from the flue gas are transferred to the seawater. The sulphur content of the effluent seawater from the process itself is increased by only approximately 3 %. \n\nOperational data\nThe system needs electrical power (seawater pumps, aeration fans and flue gas fan) and seawater. It is feasible to use spent cooling water, for example, when seawater is used as cooling water. The need for seawater is roughly 15000 - 20000 m3/h per tonne of sulphur removed. Special attention should be paid to minimise corrosion and the maintenance derived from it.\n\nApplicability\nThe feasibility of applying seawater scrubbing is site-dependent. The process needs access to seawater in large amounts at a competitive cost. Fully applied for fuels up to 1.5 % of sulphur. This system normally is applied after a particulate abatement technique to avoid contamination of sea environment by particulates (containing metals).\n\nEconomics\nSeawater scrubber annual costs depend on size and SOx in/out. The cost is comparable to wet scrubbers. Typical investement cost is in the order of EUR 60 /net kWe output of the power plant. The main operating cost is the electrical power for operation of the technique. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of SO2 emissions.\n\nExample plants\nSystem applied to some power plants aroung the world and one proven commercial application in Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC), Norway.\n\nReference literature\n[278, Alstom Power, 2000]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2952980_abstract", "x": 0.52522063, "y": 0.8976314, "title": "PROCESS CONTROL METHOD, DEVICE, AND SYSTEM", "year": 2015, "text": "Disclosed are a process control method, device, and system.

Operational slip of NH3 is around 5 ppm, a value that normally increases during the catalyst's lifetime.

This leaves the reactor with the cracked vapour product for capture in the refinery's amine scrubbing system and hence conversion of sulphur in the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU). DeSOx is a 3-step process: a) oxidation of SO2 to SO3 catalysed by cerium, b) adsorption of SO3 produced in the regenerator to give a sulphate which, on return to the reactor, c) reverts to the oxide and releases hydrogen sulphide into the product gas stream for recovery. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe amount of SOx removed is dependent on the amount of deSOx additive added to the unit, but removal efficiency is typically 20 - 60 % in full combustion mode. This technique can remove up to 30 % of SOx when used in the partial combustion mode. Typical downstream effluent has a SO2 concentration of 1300 to 3000 mg/Nm3 @ 3 % O2 (initial concentration 4250 mg/Nm3 @ 3 % O2, feedstock sulphur approximately 2.5 %).\n\nCross-media effects\nDisadvantages of the process are: \ndeSOx additive is more efficient in full burn mode.

It operates most effectively under full oxidising conditions, when as much as 50 % of the sulphur in the flue gases can be removed. Unit performance may, however, be affected and transfer catalyst replacement rate may be significant. \n\nEconomics\nThere are no major investment costs required for this option, save for the dosing equipment for introducing the additive to the catalyst system. Operating expenses are around 0.34 - 0.7 EUR/t (EUR 1 million/yr for a 1.5 Mt/yr Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)).

Furthermore, natural gas and water are needed, besides small quantities of silicone oil for the acid mist control unit.\n\nThe process produces 94  95 % pure sulphuric acid (H2SO4) for sale. The system employs a catalytic converter to oxidise SO2 to SO3 at a temperature of 400 - 420 degC. This temperature level allows a deNOx, operating at 380 degC, to be well fitted in the process. High NOx removal at high NH3 slip is possible with no risk of precipitation of ammonium sulphates, as the reactor temperatures are above the decomposition temperature (350 degC) and any NH3 slip is destroyed in the SO2 / SO3 oxidiser. The process produces no waste water or waste products, nor does it consume any chemical apart from ammonia for NOx control. The high removal of dust is demanded by the H2SO4 production step. Dedusting with an efficiency consistently at 99.9 % is required as to avoid frequent clean-up of the SO2 / SO3 converter and to maintain good product quality. The flue gas train subsequently comprises an air preheater, a high-temperature ESP, the cold side of the regenerative heat exchanger, the deNOx reactor, a heat supply, the SO2/ SO3 converter, hot-side regeneration heat-exchanger, the acid condenser (operating between 240  100 degC, hydrating SO3 and condensing the resulting acid product) which heat is used as the first step in preheating combustion air.

Figure   4 .47 gives a simplified scheme of application of a waste heat boiler.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.47:\tWaste heat boiler applied to a catcracker\nNote: CO boiler and ESP not included in this section\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe waste heat boiler recovers the heat from the flue gas and the expander can recover part of the pressure to be used in the compression of the air needed in the regenerator. An example of the application of an expander saved 15MWe for the flue gas generated by a Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) of a capacity of 5Mt/yr. \n\nCross-media effects\nSignificant quantities of catalyst fines are collected in the waste heat boiler (Waste Heat Boiler (WHB)). The newer WHBs have facilities which permanently remove the collected fines, but older WHBs are normally soot-blown once a shift. During this operation the emission of catalyst fines is especially high if the unit is not equipped with a particulate abatement technique.\n\nOperational data\nPower recovery on regeneration gas reduces CO boiler duty.\n\nApplicability\nRetrofitting of of this equipment can be very difficult because of space limitations in the refinery. On small or low pressure units, expanders are not justified economically. \n\n\nEconomics\nApplying expander on the regenerator gas could be costly because the additional particulate systems under high temperature that they need. Turbo expanders are big cost items, and so are waste heat recovery units. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nRecovery of energy\n\nExample plant(s)\nEnergy recovery by utilising an expander in the regenerator flue gas is only applied in the larger, more recently built units.\n\nReference literature\n[136, MRI, 1997], [268, Technical Working Group (TWG), 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3085454_abstract", "x": 0.70686966, "y": 0.4066874, "title": "AGGLOMERATING CYCLONE OF THE REVERSE-FLOW TYPE", "year": 2016, "text": "A family of optimised cyclones has been surprisingly detected, when incorporating into cyclone calculation the interparticle agglomeration phenomenon, the main cause of the capture of submicrometric particles by greater particles preferably having diameters of 10-20 \u00b5m, the family of optimised cyclones having a geometry defined by the following non-dimensional parameters:a/D 0.110-0.170;b/D 0.110-0.170;s/D 0.500-0.540;De /D 0.100-0.170;h/D 2.200-2.700;H/D 3.900-4.300;Db /D 0.140-0.180,\nwherein a and b are the sides of the tangential cyclone entrance, which has a rectangular cross-section, and the first of these sides is parallel to the axis of the cyclone, which has a body of height H with a cylindrical upper section having an inner diameter D and a height h, and a lower section with an inverted truncated cone shape with a minor base having the diameter Db; and a cylindrical vortex tube of height s and diameter De (inner dimensions).

Since the Claus process by itself removes about 96 % (2 stages) of the hydrogen sulphide in the gas stream, the Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) processes are often used to further recover sulphur. \nMore than 20 processes for Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) have been developed in order to enhance the recovery of Sulphur compounds from natural gas and/or refinery sources. Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) processes can be broadly divided according to the principles applied:\n\nDry bed processes, where the main process step is achieved on a solid catalyst. Two paths have been followed within this group: a) Extend Claus reaction on a solid bed, b)Oxidise sulphur compounds to SO2 prior to absorption, or reaction.\n\nLiquid Phase Sub-DewPoint processes, consisting of extending the Claus reaction under sub-dewpoint conditions in liquid phase. \n\nLiquid scrubbing processes. There are two main categories, H2S scrubbing processes and SO2 scrubbing processes. In the most commonly applied configurations, H2S or SO2 are recycled to the upstream Claus Unit.\n\nLiquid Redox process. Liquid phase oxidation processes to absorb H2S.\n\nThe first and third categories can further be divided in sub-categories depending on the sulphur recovery method used. It should be noted that a strict distinction between dry beds and liquid scrubbing processes may become uneasy as some arrangement combine the capabilities of both types of processes. Some processes belonging to the four groups above-mentioned are further explained below; this list is not intended to be exhaustive:\n\nThe H2S Scrubbing process is by far the most widely applied. The concept underlying H2S scrubbing processes are:\nHydrogenation and hydrolysis of all sulphur compounds to H2S passing it through a cobalt-molybdenum catalyst with the addition of a reducing gas\nAbsorption of H2S by an amine solution (generic amine or specialty amine)\nRegeneration of the amine solution and recycle of the H2S to the upfront Claus reaction furnace.\nSeveral Licensor currently propose variations on the H2S scrubbing process, using solvents available on the market place, or in some instances proprietary solvents. \n\n\n\nFigure 4.58:\tSimplified process flow diagram of a tail gas Claus unit (SCOT) unit\n\n\nThe Sulfreen process is a dry-bed, sub-dew point absorption process based on the extension of the Claus reaction, i.e. catalytic oxidation of H2S to S. Basically consists of two (occasionally three for large capacities) Sulfreen reactors in series with the Claus reactors. Activated Alumina is used as a catalyst. Regeneration is needed since the sulphur accumulates on the catalyst decreasing its activity. Sulphur from the hot regeneration stream is condensed in a dedicated condenser. Two variations are used: Hydrosulfreen and DoxoSulfreen.\n\nThe HydroSulfreen adds a conversion step upstream of the first Sulfreen reactor, to perform the hydrolysis of COS and CS2 to H2S with the help of a activated Titanium oxide Claus catalyst. The Claus reaction takes place in the HydroSulfreen reactor and produced sulphur is condensed in a dedicated condenser\n\nThe DoxoSulfreen concept is based on two ideas: the upstream units are operated to get a slight excess of H2S, compared to the quantity necessary to maintain the Claus ratio, therefore a nearly total SO2 conversion takes place on the conventional Sulfreen catalyst; then the remaining H2S is directly oxidised to elemental Sulphur\n\nIn the Beaven process, the hydrogen sulphide in the relatively low concentration gas stream from the Claus process can be almost completely removed by absorption in a quinone solution. The dissolved hydrogen sulphide is oxidized to form a mixture of elemental sulphur and hydro-quinone. The solution is injected with air or oxygen to oxidize the hydro-quinone back to quinone. The solution is then filtered or centrifuged to remove the sulphur and the quinone is then re-used. The Beaven process is also effective in removing small amounts of sulphur dioxide, carbonyl sulphide, and carbon disulphide that are not affected by the Claus process. These compounds are first converted to hydrogen sulphide at elevated temperatures in a cobalt molybdate catalyst prior to being fed to the Beaven unit. \n\nThe Cold Bed Absorption (CBA) (cold bed absorption), process is very similar to the Sulfreen process except in the fact that the Cold Bed Absorption (CBA) process uses a hot process stream indigenous to the Claus process to accomplish regeneration of the sulphur loaded catalyst bed. The hot process stream is part of the effluent of the first Claus reactor. Several configurations are available depending on the number of Claus converters.\n\nThe Clauspol is a process where the tail gas is put in contact with a solvent (polyethylene glycol) and the reaction of H2S and SO2 is catalysed by a dissolved catalysts. (sodium salt of an inorganic acid) which is a solvent for H2S and SO2, but not for liquid sulphur.The Claus reaction can therefore proceed at low temperature (120 degC) and is shifted further to the right as the produced sulphur is removed from the reaction medium, as it is not soluble and separates. \n\nThe Superclaus process is based on two principles:\nOperating the Claus plant with excess H2S to minimise the SO2 content in the Claus tail gas. This feature simplifies and makes more flexible the air ratio control.\nSelective oxidation of the remaining H2S in the Claus tail gas by means of specific catalyst which efficiently convert the remaining H2S in the presence of water vapour and excess oxygen to elemental sulphur only.\nThis reaction takes place in a specific converter (oxidation reactor), downstream of a two or three reactors traditional Claus unit. The catalyst used is an alumina based catalyst coated with iron oxide and chromium oxide layers.\n\nThe LO-CAT process. Absorption and regeneration are performed in a single vessel divided in two sections: the centerwell and the outer space where aeration with air is performed. The purpose of the Centerwell is to separate the sulphite ions from air in order to minimize by-product formation (e.g. thiosulphate). The difference in aeration (and therefore of density) between the centerwell and the outer space give sufficient driving force for solution circulation between the absorption and the regeneration zones without the need of a specific pump. The last type of processing scheme is called the \"aerobic unit\" and is used to treat air contaminated with H2S. All reactions take place in the same vessel, at the expense of increased by-product formation, but with the advantage of a reduced capital cost.\n\nThe SO2 abatement from the Claus plant is a process that uses a physical scrubbing mechanism to remove SO2 from the incinerated tail gas of a Claus plant. The recovered SO2 is recycled to the inlet of the Claus plant unit. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nTail gas treatment units increase the overall recovery of H2S decreasing the sulphur emissions from the refinery. For example, if a refinery has a 100 t/d Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU), with a two stage Claus reactor emits around 5 t/d of sulphur. If a tail gas clean-up process is included in such a refinery the emissions of sulphur may be reduced to 0.5 t/d, representing that a reduction of 90 % of the sulphur emissions from the sulphur recovery units. Next table shows the expected overall sulphur recovery yield, the resulting additional recovered sulphur and the dry basis sulphur emission (in the form of SO2 specie) after incineration, of the tail gas treatments considered in this Section.\n\n\n\nTable 4.134:\tExpected overall sulphur recovery yield, the resulting additional recovered sulphur and the SO2 emissions (dry basis) after incineration\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe reduction of SO2 leads to an increase of the CO2 emission. For instance the application of a tailing gas treatment would lead to a SO2 reduction of 96 % (if compared with the three reactor option), however at an increase for CO2 of 110 %. For example for a 100 t/d sulphur claus plant with three reactors, the application of a Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) would reduce the emissions of SO2 to 0.1 t/d but at a price of increasing the CO2 emissions to 18 t/d.\n\n\nTable 4.135:\tCross-media effects associated to some of the Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperational data\nGood control and availability is crucial as a technique, to deliver any design targets. The estimate of operating costs, including sulphur produced, utilities and chemicals as well as additional manpower expense are given in the following table:\n\n\nTable 4.136:\tOperating costs of some Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) units \n\n\nApplicability\nApplicable to both new and existing plants. Capacities range from 2 to more than 2000 tonnes of sulphur per day from the combined Claus/tail gas treatment units.\n\nEconomics\nThe cost of the Sulphur Recovery Unit (SRU) depends strongly on the type of tail gas treatment. Following several tables show some examples of economics of the TGTUs. \n\n\n\nUsual practice is to relate the capital cost of the TGCU to the one of the up front Claus unit. The following table gives estimate of such ratio, for a 100 t/d Claus unit (including catalyst) in a refinery environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reference to the upstream sulphur unit is indicative and corresponds to the way this kind of comparison is usually presented in the literature. This comparison should be taken with care when comparing with other studies, as the capital cost of a sulphur unit may vary greatly.\n\nA particular example of the cost of a three stages Claus plant plus Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) superclaus process is shown in the following table:\n\n\nTable 4.137:\tEconomics of tail gas treatment units of the sulphur recovery units\n\n\nAnother example of the cost of a Tail Gas Treatment Unit (TGTU) unit reports that for a Clauspol unit treating a typical Claus unit tail gas, combined production of 100 tonnes of sulphur per day (ISBL 1998 Gulf Coast location), the investment (excluding engineering and license fees) came up to 3 million US$.\n\nThe following table shows specific costs data for SO2 abatement under the assumptions outlined in Annex IV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of sulphur emissions and recovery of sulphur.\n\nExample plants\n\n\nTable 4.138:\tApproximate number of commercial installations in the world\n\nReference literature\n[195, The world refining association, 1999], [112, Foster Wheeler Energy, 1999], [309, Kerkhof, 2000], [257, Gilbert, 2000], [115, CONCAWE, 1999], [107, Janson, 1999], [181, High Pressure (HP), 1998], [114, Ademe, 1999], [45, Sema and Sofres, 1991], [346, France, 2001]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2846113_abstract", "x": 0.8203485, "y": 0.26356807, "title": "COOLING/RECOVERING SYSTEM FOR THE COOLING OF FACILITIES", "year": 2015, "text": "The invention relates to a system that is functionally associated with a refrigeration unit (1), said system comprising a primary tank (6) for the inflow of the water to be treated, and an inner tank (7) for cooling and mixing the water.

This section does not contain methods for the remediation of contaminated soils. As it was stated in the scope of this document, soil remediation techniques are considered out of the scope of this document.\n\nDescription\nMany hazardous chemicals present in refinery waste can be converted by microbiological methods to harmless compounds such as water and carbon dioxide. In general, the microbiological degradation of contaminants in soil is very slow in nature, because process conditions for such degradation are seldom favourable. To accelerate degradation a number of conditions have to be fulfilled. \n\nCurrent techniques for biological decontamination are based on optimisation of the process conditions for microbiological degradation. The appropriate micro-organisms for microbiological degradation may already be present in the waste to be treated or may have to be added. The latter is necessary if special micro-organisms are required. These special micro-organisms can be obtained by selection and adaptation.\n\nOperational data\nThe most important factors are the availability of temperature control, sufficient oxygen, nutrients, and the appropriate micro-organisms. Also important are the concentration level of the contaminants and the variation in concentration. The presence of toxic compounds can disturb the degradation process. Sometimes the presence of natural organic compounds has a positive influence on the biodegradation process.\n\nIn summary the following conditions have to be met in order to optimise the degradation rate of a waste generated by a refinery:\n\nsufficient number of micro-organisms of the right strains\nnontoxic concentrations of contaminants or other compounds \nadjustment of an accurate water content \npresence of sufficient nutrients (mainly P and N in ratio 1:10)\npresence of sufficient oxygen for aerobic processes and a full depletion of oxygen for anaerobic processes\nfavourable temperature (20  30C)\npH 6  8\ntemperature control\nmeasures have to be applied to prevent emissions into air by volatile contaminants or degradation products (by covering the area and by treating the exhaust air) and to prevent emissions into water and soil (by sealing the floor and re-use of excess water).\nsufficient availability of contaminants (preferably without high peak concentrations) to the microorganisms including good mixing of nutrients, waste, inert (e.g. soil) and contaminants.\n\nReference literature\n[115, CONCAWE, 1999]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4089050_abstract", "x": 0.49719706, "y": 0.2980045, "title": "STA-30, A NEW MEMBER OF THE SWY FAMILY OF MOLECULAR SIEVES, METHODS OF PREPARATION AND USE", "year": 2022, "text": "The present invention is directed to a method of preparing a molecular sieve of SWY framework type, denominated STA-30.

Inlet NOx concentrations to the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) vary with the type of Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) used (total or partial combustion in combination with a CO boiler) and the type of feed used (heavier feed tends to produce higher NOx emissions). Reduction by 85 - 90 % of NOx emissions with the outlet concentration of NOx reduced to 30 - 250 mg/Nm3@ 3 % O2, depending on the inlet concentration. Those reduction efficiencies provide a reduction of 300 tonnes of NOx per year from catcrackers of capacity of 1.65 Mt/yr. Other advantage is that some CO oxidation also occurs in the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process (aprox. 40%).\n\nCross-media effects \nUse of NH3 (storage/handling), risk of NH3 emissions when operating outside stoichiometric proportion and depending on the age of the catalyst (<2 - 10 mg/Nm3) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst regeneration and disposal. Ammonia needed for this technique may be supplied by two-stage sour water strippers (see Section 4.24.2). Another disadvantage of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is that a few percent of SO2 is oxidised to SO3 over the deNOx cat and as consequence it can potentially create plume opacity problems. \n\nOperational data\nCatalyst performance is expected to deteriorate with time, due mainly to the dust and SOx. However, current examples have shown lifetimes well over the expected ones (6 years). Information from operators claim that not all Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) have operated to design loads leading that fact to increase catalyst lifetimes. Some other concerns from operators is that Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) catalyst could potentially be fouled by the particulates in the flue gas stream. More general operational data for SCRs can be found in Section 4.23.3.\n\nApplicability\nBecause the temperature window is wide (300 - 400 oC), it is very flexible for retrofit applications. However, considerable space is needed for installation. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applications often requires a new waste heat boiler (full burn) or CO-boiler (partial burn) if they are not present. Preferably the deNOx unit is integrated with the waste heat boiler. Because Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) operates at oxidizing conditions it cannot be installed upstream of a CO boiler (partial burn).\n\nEconomics\nTable   4 .102 shows some examples of the economics of the application of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to FCCs\n\n\nTable 4.102:\tEconomics of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) applied to Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) units\n\n\nA more detail economic assessment of a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in a Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC) unit is shown in Table   4 .103.\n\n\nTable 4.103:\tMain cost factors for a Selective Catalytic Reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) installation (raw gas) after the Fluid Catalytic Cracker (FCC)-plant \n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of the NOx emissions.

The amount of solids removed from the desalting unit should, therefore, be maximized. Then the objective is to minimize solids leaving the desalter with the crude oil. A number of techniques can be used such as:\nuse low-shear mixing devices to mix desalter wash water and crude oil\nuse low-pressure water in the desalter to avoid turbulence\nreplace the water jets with mud rakes. They cause less turbulence when removing settled solids\nthe water phase (suspension) can be separated in a pressurised plate separator. Alternatively a combination of a hydrocyclone desalter and a hydrocyclone de-oiler can be used\nevaluate the effectiveness of a sludge wash system. The sludge washing is a batch operation meant to stir the water phase in the desalter to suspend and remove the solids accumulated on the vessel bottom. This cleaning operation increases the efficiency of desalters during normal run, particularly for long cycle runs.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nWith the application of the techniques mentioned above, the content of oil in the generated sludges can be decreased and the separation of the sludges from the water phase can be enhanced.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe application of these techniques increases the sludge generation within the refinery. At a bottom sediment content of the crude of 0.015 % w/w, theoretically 1500 t/yr sludge can be collected in a 10 Mt/yr refinery.\n\nApplicability\nWhere bottoms, sediments and water are critical in downstream process units, desalters are equipped with a bottom flushing system to remove settled solids. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnhance the separation of solids from the oil and water phase.\n\nExample plant(s)\nDesalters with desludging facilities are scarce.

The bund consists of a wall or dike around the outside of the tank to contain all or part of the tank contents in the event of a spill, and (in some cases) an impermeable ground barrier between the tank and the dike to prevent infiltration of the product into the ground. The dike is typically constructed of well-compacted earth or reinforced concrete. The height is normally sized to accommodate the maximum contents of the largest tank within the volume enclosed by the dike.  However this philosophy of total capture is flawed if the ground between the tank and dike is permeable. Oil can permeate downward and under the dike in these situations. Asphalt, concrete surface or high density polyethylene (HDPE) liner are some of the possibilities. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nContainment of large spills from liquid storage tanks.\n\nCross-media effects\nThis technique might call for the soil to be compacted, which may be seen as negative impact. A study in the United States has concluded that the effectiveness of liners in protecting the environment is limited because of their unreliability and the difficulty in inspecting or testing their integrity.  Also, there are few releases that would be contained by such liners, and moreover, they are expensive to install.  Because of this, it was concluded that other preventative measures are more effective in protecting the environment and are more cost-effective in the long run.\n\nApplicability\nIn some cases, retrofitting may not be possible.\n\nEconomics\nSome refineries have quoted the total cost for installing concrete paving under 6 big tanks at EUR 1.3 millions (0.22 per tank), the cost of sealing bund dike walls with asphalt (around 10 tanks) at EUR 0.8 million, and the cost of concrete paving bunds at 70  140 EUR/m2. One refinery quoted the cost of installing 200m of impermeable HDPE barrier along the site boundary at 150000 EUR (750 EUR/m).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nContainment of large spills that may occur from liquid storage tanks is normally regulated by national laws.

The application of ESPs is not widespread and generally they are only applied at biomass combustion units with a rated thermal input over 20 MW. Four production sites have an ESP installed. Three of the sites have a combined heat and dryer system where the drying is considered indirect, see Section 4.2.2.3.

The pond has a long hydraulic residence time for water entering the reed bed, allowing the reed bed time to biologically degrade organic components in the water. The reed bed covers a large area and is applied as a last step before discharge to surface waters. \n\nTechnical description\t\nThe reed bed acts by the filtration of suspended solids, absorption of metals by plants and by the biological degradation of easily accessible organic compounds. The reed bed should be constructed so as to give a high attenuation time for the water to pass through, which will promote biological activity and the settlement of particles.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nTreatment and attenuation of lightly contaminated surface water, removing Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and COD by filtration and biological degradation using the plants in the reed bed. \n\nNitrogen removal can also be achieved. \n\nCross-media effects\nNone.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nReed beds are used in various applications for treating lightly contaminated rainwater, e.g. in the treatment of road water. Application in the wood-based panel sector has been documented at one installation. The reed bed has a length of 800 m and receives surface run-off water from outdoor areas collected in surface drains and pumped to the reed bed. The reed bed discharges into a sensitive stream and is monitored for pH, formaldehyde and ammonium only. The discharge of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and COD is negligible and is not monitored. The level of ammonium NH4-N is between 0.6 mg/l and 4.8 mg/l with a yearly average of 2.6 mg/l and a pH between 7.2 and 8.1. Both parameters are measured daily with spot sampling. Formaldehyde is monitored daily and the yearly average is 1.1 mg/l, with variations between 0.27 mg/l and 1.97 mg/l. Mass loads are not given as the exact amount of discharged water is not known. The discharge flow is, on average, 10 m3/h and fluctuates with precipitation. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nThe reed bed can be used as a last polishing step before release to surface waters, if necessary. The reed bed can treat more complex waste water streams containing dissolved salts. The reed bed cannot be used alone, since larger solids, debris, and easily sedimented material should be removed prior to entering the reed bed. A heavy load of readily sedimented material will block the reed bed if not filtered beforehand. \n\nIn cold climates, the efficiency of the reed bed will be low during winter since the biological activity and the uptake by the reeds will be low.\n\nThe reed bed and its biology are sensitive to the concentration of chemicals and so should be protected against contaminated water, e.g. from spills and used firefighting water. \n\nA reed bed needs time to establish a sufficient filtering capacity and with age it will perform better. \n\nEconomics\nThe capital cost is dependent on the size of the reed bed and can vary widely. Maintenance and energy costs are low.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nLocal requirements related to the surface water sensitivity can dictate a higher quality of the water to be discharged.\n\nExample plants\nReed beds are used for handling lightly contaminated surface run-off waters and have been reported as being installed by at least one site. \n\nReference literature\n.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3995487_abstract", "x": 0.50773036, "y": 0.19201818, "title": "UREA PRILLING PROCESS", "year": 2022, "text": "A process of prilling of a urea melt comprising the use of calcium lignosulfonate or carboxymethyl starch as additive to obtain a formaldehyde-free urea product.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.2.3.1\" title=\"Selection of resin and appropriate press operating conditions\">\n\n<content>\nSelection of resin and appropriate press operating conditions\n\nDescription\nSelection of a resin with a low degree of free formaldehyde and use of the correct press operating conditions for the resin type, including a combination of optimal press time and temperature, in order to reduce emissions of formaldehyde. \n\nTechnical description\nFormaldehyde levels in the finished panel and in the process emissions are mainly a result of the resin system used, especially where the resin used is urea-formaldehyde resin, where the formaldehyde is more loosely bound than in other resin systems such as phenol-formaldehyde resin.

Venturi scrubbers are efficient at removing dust, particles and part of the condensable organic compounds by impaction and inertia of the jet stream of water in the scrubber. Because of the high power consumption and its low overall efficiency however, other solutions may be preferable when treating dryer waste gas. Waste gas from the press has a much lower volume and small-scale Venturi scrubbers are commonly applied for the removal of particulate material, prior to further treatment of the organic compounds in the waste gas. \n\nPacked bed wet scrubbers operate by letting the gas travel countercurrently from the bottom of a tower through a packed bed material sprayed continuously with recirculated water. \n\nWaste gases from the dryer and the press are collected and sprayed with water by spray nozzles in the duct before discharge to further treatment. The main objective of water spraying or quenching is to cool the collected waste gases, which at the same time prevents the build-up of sticky dust in the ducts. This greatly lowers the fire risk. Quenching of dryer waste gases is part of the condensation of the waste gas, which aids the capture of condensable organics in the water phase. \n\nMist eliminators can be installed in the upper part of the wet scrubber to prevent droplet carry-over.\n\nThe recirculated water in the wet scrubber needs to be treated by removing solids. Depending on the model, the internal water treatment system can be a simple sedimentation of solids and removal of the sludge by decanting. In-line screw presses dewater the sedimented sludge and return the water phase to the scrubber. Dissolved Air Flotation (Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)) can be an integrated part of the unit and effectively removes the sedimented and suspended solids by coagulation and flotation.\n\nAdditional measures, such as chemical oxidation, can be implemented to give high removal efficiencies for formaldehyde, e.g. by dosing sodium bisulphite and sodium hydroxide to the scrubber water or in a subsequent reaction tank. Chemical oxidation is applied in a few plants where the oxidation methods have been developed as an in-house research development project.\n\nChemical oxidation of the lower aldehydes and lower alcohols could be developed by a polishing step after other reduction systems where condensable organics and dust have already been reduced by other methods.\n\nTargeted chemical oxidation such as catalytic gas treatment is an additional treatment step that is applied to the waste gas after removal of particulate matter in particular and, secondly, condensable organic compounds, e.g. with a Venturi scrubber or WESP. The chemical oxidation is accomplished by hydrogen peroxide, aided by different metal catalysts and initiated by UV light for example. \n\nWater discharge, sludge handling and use of chemicals need to be considered carefully.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA wet scrubber reduces dust levels and to a certain extent reduces the content of organic compounds.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nDust and volatile organic compounds emissions from wet scrubbers are shown in Table   4 .61.\n\n\nTable 4.61:\tAverage values of periodic measurements, including minimum and maximum values, of measured dust levels in dryer emissions after treatment in a wet scrubber\n\n\nTotal Organic Compounds (TOC) levels for Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) lines are below 50 mg/Nm3 when a corresponding specific mass load below 1200 g Total Organic Compounds (TOC)/tonne of dried fibre is taken into consideration. Three Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) lines using chemical oxidation together with a wet scrubber for enhanced formaldehyde destruction showed low levels of formaldehyde both in terms of concentration and specific load. The Total Organic Compounds (TOC) values were between 148 mg/m3 and 230 mg/m3 and the specific mass load between 2400 g and 2900 g Total Organic Compounds (TOC)/tonne of dried fibre. \n \nFormaldehyde and emissions of volatile organic compounds from Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) dryer lines with wet scrubbers are shown in Table   4 .62.\n\nTable 4.62:\tEmissions of formaldehyde and related specific mass loads from Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) fibre dryers with wet scrubbers \n\n\nThe further removal of formaldehyde and, for example, methanol is reported at a few installations. At an example production site, the waste gas from the fibre dryer was treated using a wet scrubber with added sodium bisulphite and sodium hydroxide in the scrubbing water, and the site reported a removal efficiency for formaldehyde of more than 95 % and formaldehyde mass concentrations measured biweekly ranging between 1 mg/Nm3 and 4 mg/Nm3. \n\nThe removal of formaldehyde and simple alcohols and other aldehydes by catalytic gas treatment is documented in production plants in Canada and the US. The technology has not been applied in the EU. The reported removal efficiencies for formaldehyde and methanol are over 90 %, with a corresponding concentration below 1 mg/Nm3.\n\nPress emissions are often treated in smaller in-line wet scrubbers, which remove dust and a part of the VOCs and formaldehyde.\n\n\nTable 4.63:\tEmission of dust, TVOC/CVOCs and formaldehyde from press waste gas treated with wet scrubbers \n\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumption of chemicals can be necessary in order to recycle water. \nGeneration of sludge that needs further treatment. \n\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nWet scrubbers are mainly applied at Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) production lines.

Using the more problematic part of the biomass-derived fuels implies, in practice, operating an incinerator for wood waste. The hot gases are not used for direct drying but for steam generation for indirect drying, for heating thermal oil, and for producing electricity.\n\nFor a description of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants using biomass or combined fuels, see the Large Combustion Plants (LCP) BREF .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nFor an independent combustion plant producing heat for steam generation for indirect drying and power for the grid, fuel is saved by maximising the use of biomass fuel sources. \n\nFor an independent combustion plant, the energy efficiency can be high, since energy output can be regulated to make maximum use of heat and power. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nNo information available.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nFor a biomass-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, the fuel accessibility is crucial and large Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants demand very high amounts of fuel. The supply from internal production residues is not enough to cover the fuel need. In order not to use virgin biomass, which is a raw material for the sector, recovered wood is the main fuel for biomass-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants. However, the recovered wood market can be too unstable to provide a secure fuel supply.\n\nDiesel engines can be an energy-efficient choice if established primarily for power generation for the grid or for additional steam generation for indirect drying or simply for hot gas generation for direct drying and transfer of thermal energy to heat thermal oil. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants operating on liquid fuels could create emissions that are not suitable for direct drying and which will generally need an additional emission control system. \n\nEconomics\nThe investment costs for a new biomass-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant of 40 MW generating steam for indirect drying and power are about EUR 30 million, with an approximate yearly fuel consumption of 250 000 tonnes of wood biomass. If contaminated wood waste is used as a fuel, the additional costs for an abatement system should be added.\n\nExample plants\nCombined Heat and Power (CHP) plants using a variety of fuels are in operation in the sector. \n\nReference literature\n.\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3006112_abstract", "x": 0.5960207, "y": 0.33460042, "title": "PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR REFINING SAND", "year": 2016, "text": "A process for refining sand for use as frac sand comprising the steps of passing the sand through a first fines separation stage to remove fine particles of contaminant from the sand, reducing the water content of the sand to less than 20%, passing the sand into an attrition scrubber unit containing moving blades to delaminate clay and other contaminants from the sand grains, passing the sand from the attrition scrubber unit through a second fines separation stage to separate fine contaminants from the sand and dewatering the resulting sand product in a further dewatering stage.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.2.3\" title=\"Sand filters\">\n<referenced_by>4.3.3.4</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nSand filters\n\nDescription\nSand filters remove fine suspended solids after an initial sedimentation of coarser solids and material.\n\nTechnical description\nSand filters can be applied as a second step for removing suspended solids from surface run-off water from the log yard and other outdoor areas.

The very coarse material is removed by screening, while smaller particles and suspended solids are removed by filtration, coagulation and flocculation, etc. \n\nFlocculation promotes the aggregation of smaller particles into larger particles to enhance their removal by gravity separation. Flocculation is obtained by mechanical stirring or air agitation. Flocculation takes place in separate basins. An in-line addition of coagulators can be performed beforehand to aid the floc formation. \n\nFlotation is the removal of suspended solids and particles with densities close to that of water.\n\nIn dissolved air flotation (Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF)), the flocculation is aided by high pressure air that agitates and aggregates the flocs. In the basin, the light flocs are concentrated at the surface and are removed by overflow or by a scraper onto a belt press, which removes and dewaters the solids.

Sludge needs to be removed regularly from the bottom, which is achieved by sludge removal flights or other standard equipment.\n \nSludge from the above-mentioned processes consists mainly of the intercepted or settled solids and is dewatered, for example by decanting, followed by screw presses, belt presses or similar equipment, to remove excess water. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of the load of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), BOD5 and COD before further biological treatment. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe reported removal efficiencies indicate that the physical separation methods are important steps in removing solids from the waste water. The following data were reported from four Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) production plants:\n\n50 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS) removal by flocculation, sedimentation and decanting;\n30 % COD removal by sedimentation; \n60 % COD, 50 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and 50 % BOD5 removal by Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF);\n95 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS) removal by flocculation, coagulation and decanting. \n\nThe removal efficiencies are not accompanied by mass concentrations since the separation step is a step in a water treatment process. From general waste water treatment, it is expected that up to 70 % of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and up to 40 % of BOD5 are removed.\n\nThe sludge generated in the flocculation, flotation and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) is easily transferred to belt or screw presses. The sludge can, with dewatering treatment, achieve a moisture content of at least 20-25 %, which is sufficient to be handled safely. \n\nSludge from a Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) unit installed in-line in a wet abatement system is of a quality that allows it to be used as fuel. The sludge obtained from more mixed waste water streams cannot always be used as fuel, but may need further treatment. \n\nCross-media effects \nNone reported.\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nAs for retention basins, sedimentation depends on the retention time in the tank and the available surface area.

Sludge needs to be removed regularly from the bottom, which is achieved by sludge removal flights or other standard equipment.\n \nSludge from the above-mentioned processes consists mainly of the intercepted or settled solids and is dewatered, for example by decanting, followed by screw presses, belt presses or similar equipment, to remove excess water. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of the load of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), BOD5 and COD before further biological treatment. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe reported removal efficiencies indicate that the physical separation methods are important steps in removing solids from the waste water. The following data were reported from four Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) production plants:\n\n50 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS) removal by flocculation, sedimentation and decanting;\n30 % COD removal by sedimentation; \n60 % COD, 50 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and 50 % BOD5 removal by Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF);\n95 % Total Suspended Solids (TSS) removal by flocculation, coagulation and decanting. \n\nThe removal efficiencies are not accompanied by mass concentrations since the separation step is a step in a water treatment process. From general waste water treatment, it is expected that up to 70 % of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and up to 40 % of BOD5 are removed.\n\nThe sludge generated in the flocculation, flotation and Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) is easily transferred to belt or screw presses. The sludge can, with dewatering treatment, achieve a moisture content of at least 20-25 %, which is sufficient to be handled safely. \n\nSludge from a Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) unit installed in-line in a wet abatement system is of a quality that allows it to be used as fuel. The sludge obtained from more mixed waste water streams cannot always be used as fuel, but may need further treatment. \n\nCross-media effects \nNone reported.\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability \nAs for retention basins, sedimentation depends on the retention time in the tank and the available surface area. Settling and sedimentation also depend on temperature and in cold climates sedimentation takes place at a much slower rate.\n\nEconomics\nNo information or data were submitted.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and COD before further treatment in biological treatment systems.\n\nExample plants\nVarious plants use in-line Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) systems at the refiner level or with wet abatement systems.

Screening is the basic separation step used at all sites for the pretreatment of both surface run-off water and process water, e.g. from refining.\n\nTechnical description \nPhysical screening and sieving can be carried out using a range of different equipment. Screening techniques applied for the treatment of surface run-off water include fixed inclined or curved screens or rotary drum screens. Curved screens need cleaning regularly to remove collected material that has built up. Rotary drum screens consist of a cylinder rotating in a flow channel, where particles are collected either on the outer surface or inside the cylinder, depending on the direction of the flow. The collected material on the screen is continuously removed and the screen is sometimes sprayed with water to keep it clean. \n\nCentrifuges or the use of rotary disc screens that remove solids including grit and sand are applied as a pretreatment before treatment in a waste water treatment plant. The removal of grit protects equipment in the waste water treatment plant from abrasion. Reducing the level of solids also reduces the amount of solids to be removed by flocculation or sedimentation later. Rotary disc screens can remove very fine settleable solids and can be applied as an alternative to a settlement or sedimentation basin.\n\nScreened material, especially from the pretreatment of fibre waste water, is dewatered using screw presses or belt presses, before further handling. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nCoarse particles, grit and settleable solids are removed from the collected waste water.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nScreening or sieving is a preliminary step before other primary waste water treatment steps, though there are no data to show its efficiency when treating surface run-off water. The purpose of the screen is to remove large and coarse material which could disturb the further downstream treatment. The removal efficiencies are near 100 % for the size of wood material that a screen is designed to obstruct.

It is a stable compound even at high temperatures if there is no oxygen present. Hydrocarbons, on the contrary, can be decomposed and form soot at high temperatures in an oxygen-poor atmosphere. In general, it can be said that emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons may be generated when a low combustion zone temperature and inefficient mixing of fuel and air occur together. Soot contributes to the creation of blue haze when the hot gas is used for direct drying. \n\nSome measures to reduce NOX emissions, such as combustion with lower excess air or strong air staging, can increase emissions of the unburnt carbon gases. In these cases, the importance of ensuring the efficient mixing of air and fuel in the combustion system must be emphasised. NOX reduction with the Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) method can also cause higher CO emissions. CO emissions can be decreased when limestone feeding is increased in fluidised bed combustion boilers (generally not applicable for directly heated dryers). This is not generally applied in combustion plants in the sector.\n\nThe boiler efficiency and NOX generation depend largely on the correct distribution of fuel and air in the furnace.

The designer makes the sample on the computer and from this digital information the sample can be exactly reproduced on an industrial scale without the need for corrective adaptation/measures.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nResource efficiency.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn digital jet printing, selected trichromatic dyes are dosed on-line, based on computed requirements. The colour is applied on demand. This avoids dye losses or printing paste residues at the end of the process, which represents a significant change from conventional printing methods (flat-screen and rotary screen).\n\nAnother big advantage of this technique is that the amount of thickeners can be reduced depending on the type of substrate because the dye is shot directly deep into the face of the fabric.\n\nFurther environmental advantages are :\n\nreduced water consumption (only 20 % compared with conventional printing);\nless trial-and-error sampling (one of the most important sources of pollution, often forgotten in evaluations);\nthe printing process can be carried out in the final stage of the manufacturing chain (reduction of material losses, particularly of coloured fabric).\n\nCross-media effects\nCompared to analogue printing techniques, no negative cross-media effects have been identified. \n\nHowever, it is important to point out that the substrate must still undergo fixation and after-washing. Therefore emissions to water cannot be completely avoided.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThis technique is only applicable to new plants or major plant upgrades.\n\nDigital jet printing can be applied to carpet and bulky fabrics. It is also applicable for patterning runners, mats and tiles, in which case the operation is done at the end of the process on the ready-made product (which does not need to be washed afterwards).\n\nThere is still room for developments in :\n\nincreasing productivity; \nwider application (uneven pile density, pile height, blends, unfixed structure);\nreducing investment costs;\nexpanding the dye range to cover more, if not all, shades and depths.\n\nEconomics\nThe relatively high investment cost (no precise information given) of this sophisticated equipment makes this technique more appropriate for large-volume print houses. Nevertheless, digitally controlled printing and processing offers several economic advantages. First of all, this technique allows the flexibility necessary to satisfy customer and retailer demands with just-in-time delivery (quick reaction to customers' orders, alterations easily made). Equally, the storage of finished goods becomes unnecessary as goods are produced to order.

The electrons in low-temperature plasmas are able to cleave covalent chemical bonds, thereby producing physical and chemical modifications of the surface of the treated substrate.\n\nTwo types of plasma are generally used: corona plasma and low-pressure plasma.\n\nPlasma treatment can be performed on natural fibres as well as on synthetic fibres, to achieve the following effects:\n\nwool degreasing;\ndesizing;\nchange of fibre wettability (hydrophilic, hydrophobic properties);\nincrease in dyestuff affinity;\nimproved dye levelling properties;\nanti-felt finishing in wool (see Section 6.4.2);\nsterilisation (bactericidal treatment), etc.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced consumption of water and chemicals.\nReduced amount of waste water.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn general, the main advantages of plasma technology are the extremely short treatment time and the low application temperature, along with the fact that water and solvents can be avoided and no or less chemicals are required.\n\nTable 4.3 compares the characteristics of plasma and traditional wet processing.\n\n\nTable 4.3:\tComparison of plasma and traditional wet processing\n\n\nLow-pressure plasma contains a high concentration of reactive species compared to corona plasma. It requires a longer process time and only batch processes can be performed. The low-pressure plasma process has been difficult to upscale for continuous processes and batch processing limits commercial application. \n\nTable 4.4 describes the main characteristics for corona and low-pressure plasma. \n\n\nTable 4.4:\tProcess characteristics for corona plasma and low-pressure plasma\n\n\nWith this technology, the following can be achieved: \n\nDesizing: Plasma technology can be used to remove PVA sizing material from cotton fibres. In the conventional desizing process, chemicals and hot water are used to remove size. But desizing with plasma technology uses either O2/He plasma or air/He plasma. O2/He plasma has a greater effect on PVA surface chemical changes than air/He plasma. \nDyeing: The dye exhaustion rate of plasma-pretreated wool has been shown to increase by nearly 50 %: plasma-pretreated wool can achieve 90 % exhaustion in 30 minutes as compared to 60 minutes for untreated samples. O2 plasma treatment increases the wettability of wool fabric, thus leading to a dramatic increase in its wicking properties. \n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe applicability may be restricted by the characteristics of the textile materials and/or product specifications.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment costs for an atmospheric plasma machine are estimated to be around SEK 2-3 million .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nIncreased energy efficiency of treatment processes. \nHigher productivity (shorter treatment times).\n\nExample plants\nDE042 reported using corono plasma for PES finishing. \n\nReference literature\n, , , ,  \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3960871_abstract", "x": 0.49908942, "y": 0.15124823, "title": "METHOD FOR RESOLVING OPTICAL ISOMER BY USING SUPERCRITICAL FLUID EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGY", "year": 2022, "text": "Provided is a method for resolving an optical isomer from a racemate by using supercritical fluid extraction technology.

Physical scrubbing is preferred for chemical recovery, whereas chemical scrubbing is restricted to removing and abating gaseous compounds. Physico-chemical scrubbing takes an intermediate position. The component is dissolved in the absorbing liquid and involved in a reversible chemical reaction, which enables the recovery of the gaseous component. \n\nScrubbing or absorption is widely used as a raw material and/or product recovery technique for the separation and purification of gaseous streams that contain high concentrations of VOCs, especially compounds soluble in water such as alcohols, acetone or formaldehyde. The use of absorption as the primary control technique for organic vapours is subject to the availability of a suitable solvent, with a high solubility for the gas, low vapour pressure and low viscosity. \n\nThe major waste gas treatment applications of scrubbing processes are as follows:\n\nThe removal of gaseous pollutants, such as hydrogen halides, SO2, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide (H2S) or volatile organic solvents.\nThe removal of dust with certain types of scrubbers. Wet dust scrubbing entails separating the dust by intensively mixing the incoming gas with water, usually combined with the removal of the coarse particles through the use of centrifugal force. In order to achieve this, the gas is inserted tangentially (at an angle from the side). This technique allows the abatement of dust emissions and bioaerosols as well as inorganic chemicals (such as SO2, NH3, NH4Cl), VOCs and heavy metals that may be attached to the dust.\n\nDepending on the pollutants to be removed, several aqueous scrubbing liquids are used including the following:\n\nWater, to remove solvents and gases such as hydrogen halides or ammonia, with the main aim being to recover and reuse these contaminants.\nAlkaline solutions (e.g. caustic soda (i.e. sodium hydroxide) and sodium carbonate), to remove acid components such as hydrogen halides, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide (H2S), phenols, chlorine; also used for second-stage scrubbing to remove residual hydrogen halides after first-stage aqueous absorption; and for biogas desulphurisation.\nAlkaline oxidation solutions, i.e. alkaline solutions with oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), chlorine dioxide (ClO2), ozone (O3) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). \nOxidation solutions, to recover NOX from concentrated waste gases.\nSodium hydrogen sulphite solutions, to remove odour (e.g. aldehydes).\nNa2S4 solutions, to remove mercury from waste gas.\nAcidic solutions, to remove alkaline components, e.g. ammonia, amines and esters. The dosing of the acid is done by means of pH regulation.\nMonoethanolamine and diethanolamine solutions, suitable for the absorption and recovery of hydrogen sulphide.\nOrganic solvents with low volatility, e.g. chilled nonane for the recovery of light VOCs such as butanes and pentanes.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn textile finishing, the abatement efficiency is between 40 % and 70 %.

From this inventory, tailored information can be generated.\n\nThe chemicals inventory and tracking system is computer-based and contains information about:\n\nthe identity of the process chemicals;\nthe quantities, location and perishability of the process chemicals procured, recovered (see Section 4.1.6.5), stored, used and returned to suppliers;\nthe composition and physico-chemical properties of process chemicals (e.g. solubility, vapour pressure, n-octanol/water partition coefficient) including properties with adverse effects on the environment and/or human health (e.g. ecotoxicity, bioeliminability/biodegradability).\n\nSuch information may be retrieved from Safety Data Sheets, Technical Data Sheets or other sources.\n\nThe main and most commonly used sources of data used for the different chemical products are the Safety Data Sheets (Safety Data Sheet (SDS)) and to some extent the Technical Instruction Sheets. In order to facilitate evaluations, it is important to link the inventory to a comprehensive modern production planning and control system. \n\nThe inventory may be used for the following purposes:\n\nIdentification of process chemicals with acute and chronic aquatic and sediment toxicity .\nIdentification of process chemicals containing substances in the candidate list of susbtances of very high concern .\nIdentification of process chemicals which are readily, inherently or non-biodegradable in waste water treatment.\nQualitative and/or quantitative risk assessment of the process chemicals (see Section 4.1.6.1).\nIdentification of all combustible/flammable products and those which can decompose (thermally or by reaction with other chemicals).\nPlanning the use of consumption and implementing adequate storage and handling. This also allows the reduction of the risks of chemicals' expiry (and potential risks and costs of treating them as waste) and for the unused chemicals to be returned to the supplier before their expiration date, for possible resale and use (see Section 4.1.6.1).\nAssessing compatibility of process chemicals and storing the process chemicals accordingly (see Section 4.1.6.5.1).\nCompilation of data relevant for communication and reporting (with competent authorities or customers) and/or certification purposes (e.g. OEKO-TEX (STeP), Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)).\nCross-verification with restriction, authorisation and candidate lists under the REACH Regulation and manufacturing restricted and/or positive substances lists (e.g. ZDHC Manufacturer restricted substances list, bluesign system substances list), specific customer restricted substances lists or other lists.\n\nConcerning emissions to air from stenters, a reference may be made to the product-specific emission factors for chemical products used for finishing on these machines (see Section 4.1.6.4). \n\nFigure 4.9 and Figure 4.11 show examples of useful information regarding chemicals which can be included in the chemicals inventory.

The downstream user may receive additional environmental information from the formulator of hazardous mixtures, i.e. the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) may be extended with information on exposure scenarios for the hazardous substances in the mixture. A general overview of what type of information can be expected in an extended Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is presented in the ECHA guide on Safety Data Sheet (SDS) and exposure scenario . \n\nOther sources of information are Annex VI to the CLP Regulation, the REACH registration dossiers, the CoRAP evaluations, literature, etc.\n\nConcerning emissions to air from stenters, the emission factors for the various products are not contained in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) but are provided separately by the suppliers (for more information see Section 4.1.6.4). Thus, updating information on emission factors for the products concerned requires regular contact with chemical suppliers. To date, only one German company has established a laboratory stenter to determine the emission factors for the chemical products (Modern Testing Services Germany GmbH). \n\nThe software application for the establishment and implementation of the inventory and associated evaluation tools can be obtained from a range of providers available on the market (as part of an integrated business or stand-alone applications) or can be developed in-house.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical consideration relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nEconomics\nThe investment and operating costs for a chemical inventory depend on the level of sophistication intended. Estimates put the investment costs in the range of EUR 20 000 to EUR 50 000. Savings usually arise from streamlined stocks, improved management of surplus chemicals, simplification or automation of procedures/processes (e.g. by using chemical inventory software), simplication of the verification of compliance with the chemicals regulations as well as indirectly from reduced environmental management costs based on the gradual substitution of hazardous chemicals and emissions to the environment.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of chemical leftovers.\nCertification schemes.\nChemicals regulations.\n\nExample plants\nPlants from the data collection: IT082 and IT097 .\n\nReference literature\n, , , , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3434357_abstract", "x": 0.5692985, "y": 0.3257932, "title": "METHOD FOR PREPARING ISOPOROUS HOLLOW FIBER COMPOSITE MEMBRANES", "year": 2019, "text": "The present invention provides a coated hollow fiber membrane which has an isoporous inner skin and a porous outer support membrane, i.e. an inside-out isoporous composite hollow fiber membrane, and to a method of preparing such membranes.

Basic data for streams include information on environmentally important characteristics, like presence of hazardous substances, their toxicity, composition and quantities. These data are used in mass balances, efficiency plans and for monitoring of emissions.\n\nTechnical description\nAll environmental problems are directly linked to input/output streams. In the interests of identifying options and priorities for improving environmental and economic performance, it is therefore vital to know as much as possible about their quality and quantity.\n\nInput/output stream inventories can be drawn up on different levels. The most general level is an annual site-specific overview.\n\nFigure 4.2 indicates the relevant input/output streams. Starting from the annual values, specific input and output factors for the textile substrate can be calculated (e.g. litres of water consumption/kg of processed textiles or g of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in waste water/kg of processed textiles). Although these factors have their limitations, they allow preliminary comparisons with other plants or similar processes and they provide a baseline against which to start tracking consumption and emission levels. Examples of the use of input/output stream inventories are presented in .\n\nFigure 4.2:\tScheme for annual input/output overview at site level \n\n\nThe inventory contains the following information:\n\ninformation about the production process(es), including:\nsimplified process flow sheets that show the origin of the emissions; \ndescriptions of process-integrated techniques and waste water/waste gas treatment techniques to prevent or reduce emissions, including their performance (e.g. abatement efficiency);\ninformation about the quantity and characteristics of materials used, including textile materials and process chemicals (see Sections 4.1.5 and 4.1.6); \ninformation about water consumption and usage (e.g. flow diagrams and water mass balances);\ninformation about energy consumption and usage; \ninformation about the quantity and characteristics of the waste water streams, such as:\naverage values and variability of flow, pH, temperature and conductivity;\naverage concentration and mass flow values of relevant substances/parameters (e.g. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/Total Organic Carbon (TOC), nitrogen species, phosphorus, metals, priority substances, microplastics) and their variability;\ndata on toxicity, bioeliminability and biodegradability (e.g. BODn, BODn to Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) ratio, results of Zahn-Wellens Test, biological inhibition potential (e.g. inhibition of activated sludge));\ninformation about the characteristics of the waste gas streams, such as: \naverage values and variability of flow and temperature;\naverage concentration and mass flow values of relevant substances/parameters (e.g. dust, organic compounds) as well as their variability; emission factors may be used to assess the variability of emissions to air (see Section 4.1.6.4);\nflammability, lower and higher explosive limits, reactivity, hazardous properties;\npresence of other substances that may affect the waste gas treatment system or plant safety (e.g. water vapour, dust);\ninformation about the quantity and characteristics of waste generated.\n\nPre-screening of incoming raw materials (fibres, chemicals, dyestuffs, auxiliaries, etc.) is of the utmost importance for pollution prevention (see Section 4.1.5.1.1). The supplier provides adequate information that enables the mill to make a responsible environmental evaluation, even of proprietary products.\n\nThe detailed information provided to the finisher about textile raw material is not limited to the technical characteristics of the textile substrate but also includes the type and amount of preparation agents and sizing agents, and the amount of residual monomers, metals and biocides (e.g. ectoparasiticides for wool) present on the fibre. These substances/impurities are carried over into the process and account for a significant percentage of the pollutant load from textile mills. Improved knowledge of the raw material will allow the manufacturer to prevent or at least control the resulting emissions.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe described evaluation and inventory of input/output mass streams is an essential management tool for the identification of optimisation potential, both environmental and economic. It is the prerequisite for a continuous improvement process.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe application of such a management tool requires highly qualified staff and the commitment of the management. \n\nThe input/output streams inventory allows cross-media effects to be taken into consideration during the assessment of potential optimisation options. This means the achievement of a high level of protection of the environment as a whole.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique is applicable to both new and existing installations. Provided that the management of a company is convinced of the benefits of such a tool, there are no limitations to its applicability, regardless of the size of the mill.\n\nThe scope (e.g. level of detail) and nature of the inventory will generally be related to the nature, scale and complexity of the installation, and the range of environmental impacts it may have.\n\n\nEconomics\nThere is no specific information available on economic aspects but, generally speaking, because of the significant potential for improvements in the textile sector, the management tool described pays for itself within a short time .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nOne driving force is savings on raw materials and production costs. The application of this type of approach makes it easier to implement environmental management systems such as Eco-management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) or ISO 14001:2015.\n\nExample plants\nA total of 104 plants reported applying this technique .\n\nReferences literature\n, , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3530792_abstract", "x": 0.5792832, "y": 0.4573703, "title": "WATERLESS DYEING DEVICE AND METHOD FOR BOBBIN YARN, AND PRODUCT", "year": 2019, "text": "A waterless dyeing device for cone yarn, a waterless dyeing method and a produce are provided; wherein the device comprising: a dye autoclave (1); a dyeing autoclave (2); a recycle autoclave (6); a dyeing circulation system in which the dye autoclave (1), the dyeing autoclave (2) and the recycle autoclave (6) are in fluid communication with; wherein further comprises: a cone yarn inlet formed on the top of the dyeing autoclave (2), which is provided with a sealing cap (7); a cone yarn center shaft(10) vertically disposed at the center inside the dyeing autoclave, which is a perforated outlet tube with fluid discharge holes opened on the side wall; an intake pipe (13) disposed on the bottom of the dying autoclave (2) which is in communication with the cone yarn center shaft (10); a dyeing autoclave outlet (9) disposed on the dying autoclave (2); and a CO2 container(4), a pressure pump, a circulation pump (3) and conduits which are included in the dyeing circulation system.

These dyes require a lower salt concentration.\n\nTechnical description\nBifunctional (polyfunctional) reactive dyes, containing two similar or dissimilar reactive systems, offer very high levels of fixation in exhaust dyeing. Because of their two reactive groups, bifunctional reactive dyes have an increased probability of chemical reaction with cellulose fibres compared to monofunctional dyes with one reactive group. If one of the reactive groups hydrolyses during the dyeing process, the other one can still chemically react with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Moreover, combining two reactive systems in the same dye delivers the advantages of the two individual groups (e.g. high degree of fixation with high fastness levels and wash-off). However, polyfunctional dyes are not necessarily better. Only the right combination of reactive groups makes them superior to conventional monoreactive dyes. \n\nMost of these dyes are bifunctional dyes with monoflurotriazine (MFT) and monochlorotriazine (MCT) functional groups, furthermore, for trifunctional reactive dyes, the vinyl sulphone (Vinyl Sulphone (VS)) functional group is included in combination . Figure 4.44 illustrates the examples of reactive dyeing mechanisms of polyfunctional reactive dyes.\n\n\nFigure 4.44:\tExamples of reactive dyeing mechanisms of polyfunctional reactive dyes\n\n\nBecause of the reduced amount of salt needed for their exhaustion, low-salt dyes are more soluble and can be kept in solution at a higher concentration than necessary for low-liquor-ratio dyeing machines. This offers further possibilities for reducing the overall salt quantity, as illustrated in Table 4.76 below.\n\n\nTable 4.76:\tQuantities of salt required for dyeing 1 000 kg of fabric to a medium depth of shade\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of unused dyestuff ending up in the waste water stream (reduced colour and organic load).\nLower salinity of emissions to water.\nReduction of chemical consumption.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe fixation of a reactive dye with cellulose can be expressed either as a percentage of the total dye applied (fixation rate, sometimes also called absolute fixation) or as a percentage of the dye exhausted (exhaustion rate, sometimes also called fixation efficiency). In the case of monofunctional dyes, the fixation rate is approximately 60 % (with an exhaustion rate of about 70 %), which means that 40 % of the dye applied is lost in the effluent. In the case of bifunctional reactive dyes, an 80 % fixation rate and over 90 % exhaustion rate are achieved.\n\nThis is particularly advantageous when advanced oxidation techniques are applied to treat the dye in the effluent (see Section 4.1.7.3.4.1). It has to be noted, however, that a lower amount of dye in the effluent does not necessarily produce a reduction in colour. The tinctorial strength of new reactive dyes has significantly improved. This means that deeper and more intense shades are possible with less dye than necessary with other dyes or dye classes. Less dye is therefore left in the effluent, but colour may be still high .\n\nWith those dyes, post-rinsing to obtain the required level of wet-fastness can be performed quickly and with relatively little energy and water. This is partly a consequence of the high fixation yield of the bifunctional dyes (only a small amount of unfixed dye needs to be washed off). More important, however, is the fact that some new reactive dyes have molecules especially designed to show reduced affinity when they are in the hydrolysed form, which means that they have excellent wash-off properties.\n\nA shorter processing time may be obtained on certain substrates by combining the pretreatment and dyeing steps using polyfunctional dyes that fix at 90 degC. Savings of up to 40 % in water and energy consumption and more than 30 % of salt consumption are claimed.\n \nTo facilitate selection and application, dye manufacturers introduced small dye ranges comprising highly compatible dyes with virtually identical behaviour in the dye bath. Each of these compact ranges is geared to specific application segments. Also, dyeing compatibility matrixes are provided. This is important in order to obtain high reproducibility, low dependency on dyeing conditions (e.g. liquor ratio, dyeing temperature, salt concentration) and therefore 'right-first-time' dyeing.\n\nHigh-fixation reactive dyes can be applied in all types of dyeing machines, but offer a particular advantage on the most modern low-liquor-ratio dyeing machines fitted with multi-task controllers where additional advantages in terms of reduced energy and water consumption can be exploited . In particular, new reactive dyes with very good solubility can be applied at ultra-low liquor ratios .\n\nSalt consumption for exhaust dyeing of cellulose fibres is reduced by about one third of the quantity needed for conventional reactive dyestuffs, with positive effects on effluent salinity and smooth running of waste water treatment units .\n\nLow-salt reactive dyes are high-affinity dyes, which makes them less easy to wash off than low- or medium-affinity types. However, dyes with low affinity in the hydrolysed (unfixed) form are increasingly available, making post-rinsing operations much easier. \n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nEconomics\nCompared to conventional reactive dyes, polyfunctional reactive dyestuffs are more expensive, but the higher fixation efficiency, the savings on salt usage and the reduced water and energy consumption lead to a significant reduction of the total cost.\n\n\nCost savings are achieved by the application of the new dyes, especially for dark, problematic dyes, e.g. royal blue, with regard to the following parameters:\n\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental legislation.\nReduction of total processing costs achievable thanks to high dye fixation .\nWater scarcity.\nSalt-induced corrosion.\n\nExample plants\nPlants from the data collection: CZ019, DE051, FR133, IT059, IT064, IT065, IT067, IT068, IT070, IT077, IT078, IT082, IT085, IT087, IT092, IT094, IT096, IT097, PT099, PT114, PT115 and UK124.\n\nReference literature\n, , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3095507_abstract", "x": 0.63276964, "y": 0.34640142, "title": "MEMBRANE CONNECTOR TO PROMOTE MASS TRANSFER IN A MEMBRANE AERATED BIOFILM REACTOR (MABR)", "year": 2016, "text": "A membrane fibre bunch for use in a membrane-aerated biofilm reactor (MABR), the MABR having a housing, the membrane fibre bunch comprising: a group of membrane fibres arranged as a bunch of vertical or horizontal membrane fibres attached at either end to an gas supply manifold within the housing, with each fibre having a lumen containing a gas phase; and a means for connecting the group of membrane fibres so that the gas can flow within the lumen of the membrane; wherein the group of membrane fibres are maintained in position by a connector or overmold, the connector or overmold configured to maintain the group of membrane fibres in a spaced-apart configuration from one another.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.1.6.3.3\" title=\"Waste waster treatment of segregated streams in a membrane biological reactor\">\n<references_to>4.1.7.3</references_to>\n\n<content>\nWaste waster treatment of segregated streams in a membrane biological reactor\n\nDescription\nEffluents containing poorly biodegradable compounds (e.g. polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) removed from fabric during desizing) are treated in a membrane biological reactor. \n\nTechnical description\nPVA is only biodegradable under certain conditions. These include a waste water temperature of more than 15 degC, a food to microorganisms ratio of less than 0.15 kg BOD5/kg Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) x d and adaptation of the biomass . If in an industrial or municipal biological waste water treatment plant these conditions cannot be maintained over the entire year (e.g. due to very low waste water temperature in winter or very high in the summer), additional treatment is required.\n\nA membrane biological reactor (Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR)) (see Section 4.1.7.3.5.1.2) equipped with an ultrafiltration membrane, preventing residual PVA from leaving the reactor, can be used for treatment at unfavourable temperatures by using adapted microorganisms. The membrane can either be separately installed or directly submerged in the activated sludge tank.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe emission of PVA to water bodies is drastically minimised over the entire year, including wintertime with low waste water temperatures.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFigure 4.23 shows a waste water treatment plant with PVA-containing streams originating from desizing machines. The waste water streams are then segregated by automated valves and directed to an equalisation tank from where the streams are fed to the tube flocculator and subsequently to the membrane bioreactor (Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR)). The food to microorganisms ratio is about 0.2 kg BOD5/kg Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS) x d. PVA is degraded between 95 % and 98 %, even at temperatures of 40 degC. To still enable biodegradation, the PVA-degrading microorganisms have been adapted to elevated temperature levels.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.23:\tScheme of a waste water pretreatment plant with a membrane bioreactor (Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR)) for biological PVA degradation\n\n\nCross-media effects\nCompared to the treatment in a conventional activated sludge system or in a municipal waste water treatment plant, biological treatment in a Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR) requires additional energy as the energy consumption of a Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR) plant is higher than that of conventional activated sludge systems.\n\nTechnical consideration relevant to applicability\nThe technique is applicable to both new and existing plants. However, in existing plants, sufficient space for equalisation tanks and the Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR) plant is a prerequisite. Furthermore, in existing plants additional waste water pipes have to be retrofitted to enable proper segregation of the different waste water streams. It can be expected that low waste water temperatures (where PVA degradation is low) usually only occur in colder parts of Europe (e.g. central and northern Europe).\n\nEconomics\nThe investment costs for the plant shown in Figure 4.23 were around EUR 1.5 million.

This technique is useful for removing the surface scum resulting from poor quality water, chemicals or inefficient pretreatment, but it is inefficient in terms of water consumption, especially in machines with a high liquor ratio.\n\nBetter options are as follows:\n\nThe 'drain and fill' method \nThe 'drain and fill' method is a more efficient technique in terms of water consumption. Here, rinsing is achieved by successive filling, running and draining steps. Among the various factors playing a role in this process, it is worth noting the influence of the liquor ratio and draining time on the rinsing efficiency, as calculated using the equation below: \n\nCf = Cs x R/L.R.\n\nwhere:\nCf \t= concentration of solute in the subsequent rinse bath;\nCs \t= concentration of solute in the previous bath;\nR \t= retention capacity (or carry-over) of the substrate (l/kg);\nL.R.\t= liquor ratio (l/kg).\n\nFrom the equation it can be demonstrated that at lower liquor ratios more rinsing steps are required in order to achieve the same dilution effect, but actually using less water. The following example for cotton dyeing with reactive dyes clearly shows this. Considering an exhausted dye liquor containing 60 g/l electrolyte, with a retention capacity of the substrate of 3 l/kg (R) and a liquor ratio of 1:15 (L.R.), the concentration of electrolyte Cf in the subsequent rinse bath after one drain/fill operation will be 12 g/l and after two drain/fill operations will be 2.4 g/l. Conversely, if the liquor ratio is reduced to 1:7, Cf becomes 26 g/l and 11 g/l, respectively, for one and two subsequent rinses.\n\nMoreover, the substrate in the machine retains much of the previous bath, which is expressed by the R parameter (retention capacity). This can be reduced by proper draining (increasing draining times) or, in some batch machines (e.g. yarn package dyeing, stock dyeing), by blowing air through the fabric or by vacuum extraction between washing steps. \n\nThe main disadvantages of the traditional 'drain and fill' rinsing method are:\n\nthe longer production cycle time, which means lower productivity;\nthe thermal shock to which the substrate is subjected during the first rinsing;\nthe deposition of scum on the substrate between rinses as the liquor drains; this means that the removed chemicals or impurities can re-deposit on the surface of the textile material, especially if the machine is refilled with cold water.\n\nAll these limitations have been solved in modern machinery:\n\nCycle time: the machines are equipped with special time-saving devices (power draining and filling, combined cooling and rinsing, full volume heated tanks, etc.), which allows shorter time cycles compared to traditional 'overflow' rinsing.\nThermal shock: the thermal shock during the first rinsing step can be avoided using the 'combined cooling and rinsing' system. This is again a common feature of modern machinery, which allows simultaneous cooling and rinsing of the processed textile. Clean water is introduced through the jet/overflow nozzle after it has been preheated by passing it through either the machine's main heat exchanger or an external high-efficiency plate heat exchanger. The contaminated waste liquor is then drained.\nDeposition of scum on the substrate: this remains a limitation of the 'drain and fill' method. This is why batch dyeing machines are designed to allow rinsing in either the 'drain and fill' or the 'smart rinsing' mode. The latter, which is described below, is a 'controlled overflow' method that can be used for the first rinsing step before switching to the 'drain and fill' mode.\n\n'Smart rinsing' systems \nThe use of low-liquor-ratio machines is a specific requirement for effective use of 'smart rinsing' systems. Rinsing is achieved by feeding clean water into the machine and draining it through an overflow weir set low down in the dyeing machine. In addition, the clean water flow in the machine is regulated at an equivalent rate to that of the liquor draining through the low-level overflow. Compared to traditional overflow rinsing, the dilution effect is increased thanks to the reduced volume of contaminated liquor circulating in the machine. The technique is particularly efficient when hot water is used for rinsing. This can be done in an efficient way by 'combined cooling and rinsing', which allows simultaneous cooling and rinsing of the processed textile as described above.\n\nIn this case, the final concentration of the solute at the end of the rinsing sequence is given by the following equation:\n\nCf = Cs x exp-(Rt/Vk)\n\nwhere:\nCf \t= final concentration of the solute;\nCs \t= starting concentration of the solute;\nR \t= flow rate of incoming fresh liquor (l/min);\nt \t= rinsing time (min);\nVk \t= volume of liquor bath (l).\n\nThe liquor ratio is one determining factor: the higher the liquor volume, the longer the rinsing time required (and therefore the higher the water consumption) to reach the same dilution effect at the same flow rate. The flow rate R also significantly influences rinsing efficiency. If the rate is reduced, longer rinsing times are needed to achieve the same end point, but this time the water consumption would be unaltered. \n\nFurther process optimisation may be achieved by applying systems such as on-line conductivity meters to signal the attainment of a preset concentration of salt (when using reactive dyes) or by colorimeters to facilitate rinsing to the optimum end point.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced water consumption.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\n'Drain and fill' and 'smart rinsing' are both more efficient in terms of water consumption than conventional overflow rinsing.\n\nAs far as the 'drain and fill' method is concerned, replacing each overflow rinse by two to four 'drain and fill' cycles can achieve a water consumption reduction of 50-75 %.\n\nReduced water consumption also means reduced energy consumption, since hot and warm rinsing steps are often required. In addition, energy savings are obtained with combined cooling and rinsing techniques.\n\nOne fundamental feature of both 'smart rinsing' and 'drain and fill' compared to the conventional overflow method is that it is possible to keep the exhausted concentrated dye liquor and the rinsing waters as separate streams. This means that they can be reused or at least treated separately and thermal energy can thus be recovered.\n\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe adoption of the 'drain and fill' rinsing technique is generally applicable to both new and existing equipment, but is more efficient on low-liquor-ratio machines equipped with time-saving devices (power draining and filling, combined cooling and rinsing, full volume heated tanks, etc.).\n\nThe concept of 'smart rinsing' has been developed specifically to solve the problems with fabric rinsing.\n\nBoth 'smart rinsing' and 'rapid drain and fill' systems are available on all jet and overflow machines . This is also the case for the 'combined cooling and rinsing' system. Most of the new dyeing machines have systems (e.g. stock tanks with internal heat exchangers large enough to accommodate the nominal running capacity of the machine) that allow simultaneous cooling and rinsing of the fabric. If auxiliary tanks to enable these systems are needed in existing plants, such an upgrade may be restricted by a lack of space.\n\nEconomics\n'Smart rinsing' and 'rapid drain and fill' offer great potential advantages, not only in terms of efficient use of water and energy, but also in allowing shorter production cycles, and thereby a reduction in total production costs. \n\nThe application of the conventional 'drain and fill' technique, although easy to implement (i.e. no need for investment in new machinery), will not allow shorter production cycle times or a productivity increase.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nReduction of production cycle time (increase in productivity) without compromising right-first-time performance is the main driving force for the application of this technique.\n\nExample plants\nPlants from the data collection: IT064, IT068, IT071, IT072, IT077, IT089, IT090, IT091, IT094, PT108 and PT114.\n\nReference literature\n, , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3549651_abstract", "x": 0.6519905, "y": 0.36401665, "title": "SELF-DRIVEN CENTRIFUGAL SEPARATOR", "year": 2019, "text": "Separator (1) of impurities present in a fluid circulating in a system, comprising a container (2) that extends according to a longitudinal direction (Y) and in which the following are defined: an inlet (3) of the entering fluid (Fe) to be filtered and an outlet (4) of the filtered fluid (Fu), a sedimentation chamber (5) of the impurities, a separation chamber (6) of the impurities arranged coaxially according to the longitudinal direction (Y) above the sedimentation chamber (5) and communicating with the inlet (3) and with the sedimentation chamber (5), a filtering group (7) housed in such a separation chamber (6) and provided with through openings for the passage of the entering fluid (Fe) from the separation chamber (6) to the sedimentation chamber (5), and a duct (7a) defined inside the filtering group (7) that places the sedimentation chamber (5) in communication with the outlet (4), in which the filtering group (7) comprises at least one finned group (70) adapted for being set in rotation when it is hit by the flow of the fluid (Fe) entering from the inlet (3).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.1.6.2.3.6\" title=\"Sedimentation\">\n\n<content>\nSedimentation\n\nDescription\n\nSedimentation, or clarification, is the separation of suspended particles and floating material by gravitational settling.\n\nThe settled solids are removed as sludge from the bottom, whereas floated material is skimmed from the water surface.

Green waste, sawdust, woodchip and straw have reportedly been used successfully. Some 'structural material' (size up to 50 mm) is needed in the co-composted material in order to allow the ready ingress of air. \n\nThe residual grease content of the sludge sent for composting is a key control parameter. For coarse wool, this content is about of 10-12 % by weight and may be higher for fine wool. With a higher content of residual grease, the composting time may be longer and the C/N ratio would need to be adjusted accordingly. Moreover, the sludge gets stickier and is thefore more difficult to handle mechanically .\n\nThe composting process is described extensively in .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nBenefits include resource efficiency and reduction of the volume of waste sent for disposal.\n\nThe carbon which is decomposed by the composting process is converted aerobically into carbon dioxide, rather than methane (as in landfill). Carbon dioxide is a much less potent greenhouse gas than methane .\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nFor wool scouring sludges, the purpose of composting is to destroy, as far as possible, the components of the sludges which would be undesirable if spread on agricultural land. In the main, these are wool grease and ectoparasiticide residues. Composts produced from mixtures containing wool grease should therefore be periodically monitored for grease and ectoparasiticide content.\n\nIn composting trials carried out in the UK, similar results were achieved by composting for 6-7 weeks in a 10-tonne open windrow and for 14 days in an enclosed tunnel composter. The grease, organochlorine and synthetic pyrethroid ectoparasiticide content of the compost were reduced by 60 % and organophosphate ectoparasiticides were reduced by 80 %. Further reductions were expected during the maturation phase, but were not monitored. Interestingly, the woodchips and sawdust used as co-compostable material in this trial were found to be contaminated with lindane (OC) .\n\nCross-media effects\nComposting can cause air pollution by odours and dust and water pollution via leachate (see ). The use of compost as a soil conditioner may also cause water pollution if ectoparasiticide residues are present .\n\nTechnical restrictions related to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nThis measure is applicable on site by scourers who have sufficient space. Off site, it is widely available, though transport costs (because of distance from merchant composters) might be a problem for some scourers.\n\nEconomics\nComposting is not an inexpensive technique. Capital costs are reported in Figure 4.26 for composting plant start-ups, while Table 4.52 gives information for in-vessel systems.\n\n\nFigure 4.26:\tCapital costs of composting plant start-ups in the UK \n\n\nTable 4.52:\tComposting and maturation times, capital and treatment costs, for three types of in-vessel composting plant\n\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCosts of landfilling.\n\nExample plants\nPlants from the data collection: CZ016, IT075, IT076, UK128 and UK129.\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3916149_abstract", "x": 0.5704216, "y": 0.22213206, "title": "METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR CONTROLLED PRETREATMENT OF BIOMASS", "year": 2021, "text": "The present disclosure generally relates to a method for controlled pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.

In order to avoid crease marks from longer steaming, a high liquor pick-up impregnation is used.

The selection of process chemicals is based on:\nthe comparative analysis of their bioeliminability, ecotoxicity and potential to be released into the environment (which in the case of emissions to air can be determined by using emission factors for example (see Section 4.1.6.4));\nthe characterisation of the risks associated with the process chemicals, based on the chemicals' hazard classification, pathways through the plant, potential release and level of exposure;\nthe potential for recovery and reuse (see Sections 4.1.3.3 and 4.5.1.8 as well as Section 4.4.8.2);\nthe regular (e.g. annual) analysis of the potential for substitution with the aim to identify potentially new available and safer alternatives to the use of (groups of) hazardous substances and substances of very high concern, such as PFAS, phthalates, brominated flame retardants, chromium-(VI)-containing substances; this may be achieved by changing process(es) or using other process chemicals with no or lower environmental impacts;\nthe anticipatory analysis of regulatory changes related to hazardous substances and substances of very high concern, and safeguarding compliance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nThe inventory of process chemicals (see Section 4.1.6.2) may be used to provide and keep the information needed for the selection of process chemicals.\n\nThe criteria for selecting process chemicals and their suppliers may be based on certification schemes or standards. In that case, the compliance of the process chemicals and their suppliers with these schemes or standards is regularly verified.\n\nGoals and action plans to avoid or reduce the use of and risks associated with hazardous substances and substances of very high concern.\nDevelopment and implementation of procedures for the procurement, handling, storage and use of process chemicals (see Section 4.1.6.6), disposal of waste containing process chemicals (see Section 4.1.9.2) and return of unused process chemicals, to prevent or reduce emissions to the environment.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of the use of hazardous chemicals.\nReduction of emissions of hazardous chemicals to air, water, groundwater and soil.\nReduction of the amount of hazardous chemicals in waste.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe selection of chemicals and chemical suppliers is facilitated by adhesion to voluntary certification schemes, private initiatives or cooperation in which the presence of hazardous chemicals is controlled along the supply chain and chemicals and preparations are regularly screened for compliance against criteria and thresholds of established manufacturing restricted substance lists. Examples of such certification schemes include Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Textile Standard, OEKO-TEX (ECO PASSPORT), bluesign, ZDHC and others.\n\nEffective communication between downstream users and suppliers at all stages in the REACH process also helps to ensure that relevant information is provided in the supply chain . \nThe list of REACH restrictions regarding textile products may be consulted at .\n\nMethodologies and tools for conducting qualitative and/or quantitative chemical risk asssessments are available (e.g. REACH Annex I or XII , the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES)) software  and Exchange Network on Exposure Scenarios (Exchange Network on Exposure Scenarios (ENES))). \n\nSection 8.8 gives an example of a methodology for identifying process chemicals for which prevention and reduction measures need to be taken in order of priority as far as emissions to water are concerned. This could also be used as a tool to select process chemicals. As sources of information on hazardous and risk properties of substances, Annex VI to the CLP Regulation, the REACH registration dossiers, the CoRAP evaluations, literature, etc. could be used.\n\nPrecisely estimating the quantities of chemicals/preparations needed in formulations for treating textiles (production planning) lowers the quantities of leftover chemicals (see Section 4.1.6.5). To free up storage space and reduce the risks of chemical expiry (and the potential risks and costs of treating them as waste), the unused chemicals (in their original packaging) are preferably returned to the supplier before their expiration date, for possible resale and use. This is achieved especially by using innovative business models like chemical leasing, closed-loop chemical management, etc.\n\nThe information on unwanted hazardous substances in the purchased chemicals/preparations and the quantities of returned unused leftover chemicals/preparations is also used in overviews of material flows through the installation (see Sections 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2).\n\nMore details about the operational data of some components of the Chemicals Management System (CMS) may be found in Sections 4.1.6.2 to 4.1.6.8.\n\nInformation about substitution of hazardous chemicals is given in Section 4.1.6.9 and in the process-specific sections of Chapter 4 (Sections 4.2 to 4.7).\n\nCross-media effects\nNone reported.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe components described above can typically be applied to all installations within the scope of this document.

If not possible, flame retardants are selected considering:\n\nthe risks associated with the substances (see Section 4.1.6.1) in particular in terms of persistence and toxicity, including the potential for substitution (e.g. brominated flame retardants (see Section 4.1.6.1));\nthe composition and form of the textile materials to be treated;\nthe product specifications (e.g. combined flame retardance and oil-/water-/soil-repellence, wash durability).\n\nTechnical description\nDue to the complexity and number of possible combinations of textile substrate, finishing treatment and desired product properties, there is no overarching (one-size-fits-all) solution for suitable flame retardants. There are options available for certain specific textile products, but they are typically not transferrable to other textile products where flame resistance is required \n\nMoreover, the potential hazardousness of the flame retardants as well as their regulatory status also needs to be taken into account, by using the ECHA search tool .\n\nFor example, some brominated flame retardants (see also Section 8.1.8.4) are now strictly regulated:\n\ndecabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE) which is listed in Annex XVII to REACH and cannot be manufactured or placed on the market at concentrations above 0.1 % w/w (with some exemptions possible); \nhexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) which is banned by the POP Regulation  and is listed in Annex XIV to REACH and is therefore subject to authorisation .\n\nIntensive technical screening on a case-by-case basis is therefore needed to find suitable flame retardants and a number of criteria and/or product specifications may be used to carry out this screening:\n\nthe alternative chemical is halogen-free;\nit does not contain other toxic compounds (antimony, formaldehyde, etc.) that may be associated with adverse health effects in animals and humans (workers or end users);\nit does not bioaccumulate in animals and humans;\nit is easily removable from the waste water;\nit does not migrate to the surface of the substrate, via leaching or volatilisation (i.e. it is fixed on the matrix);\nin comparison with the orginal chemical, it reduces smoke formation and the smoke produced is less harmful;\nit is renewable and bio-based;\nit is recyclable.\n\n\nAdditionally, in the case of using alternatives to halogenated flame retardants (e.g. brominated flame reatardants) the important aspects to take into account are:\n\nhigher loadings and more chemicals are needed to realise the same fire-resistant properties in the textile;\nthey are more prone to hydrolysis;\nsome flame retardants are coloured (e.g. red phosphor, graphite);\nthey are more difficult to disperse in formulation;\nthey have different fire-resistant mechanisms; \nthey change the properties of the textile (e.g. hardness, plasticity); \ntheir compliance with the requirements for fire-resistant properties of top-quality applications (e.g. hotels, boats, aeroplanes, trains, cinemas, theatres).\n \n\nThe certification of chemicals under existing schemes can help ensure that some of these criteria are fulfilled. \n\nPossible fire retardants are distinguished based on their permanence in permanent fire retardants, on the one hand, and in non-permanent fire retardants on the other hand:\n\nPermanent fire retardance can be achieved by: \nchemically binding complex organophosphorus compounds to fibres by treatment with an ammoniac or a melamine derivate (see Section 4.7.4.2); \nmixing a flame retardant in melt spinning or in polymer granulates; \nmixing fibres with polymers or co-polymers that are fire-retardant (e.g. polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, acrylic-based polymer combinations with antimony trioxide, polyphosphonates; \ntreating wool with zirconium salts for example. \nNon-permanent (not wash-proof) fire retardants include: \nammonium salts from phosphate, bromide, chloride, sulphonate; \nboracic acid, borax.\n  \n\nFlame retardant preparations with less than 0.1 % formaldehyde in the formulation are used for reducing formaldehyde emissions from the flame-retardant treatments .\n\nOrganophosphorus compounds\nTextiles can be made fire-resistant by including phosphorus (P)-containing compounds, which in case of fire, act to convert carbon in the textile to a layer of char which blocks the access of oxygen to the textile, isolates against heat and limits the release of flammable gases from the textile, so preventing or limiting the fire development , .\n\nOrganic phosphorus compounds are used on the front side of textiles, so particular textile properties are thereby lost (technical limitation). However, as opposed to chemically binding complex organophosphorus compounds, non-permanent organophosphorus compounds offer very little resistance against moisture (for example they are washed out when the textile is cleaned). Thus, there are some technical limitations to the use of organophosphorus compounds. In addition, it should be noted that some organosphosphorus flame retardants are also halogenated (mostly chlorinated) and that several organophosphorus compounds have a harmonised classification under CLP for their hazard profile.\n\nProducts based on a dispersion of phosphorus-containing compounds offer environmental and economic advantages for flame-retardant finishing for 100 % PES substrates: Condensation temperatures (150-170 degC) are lower compared to the conventional thermosol process (190-200 degC) and no emissions of formaldehyde are induced. Final cleaning is not necessary. The product meets the values of the international standards such as DIN 4102 B1/B2, BS 5867 Part 2 and NFP 92-504 (M1) .\n\nMelamine\nProducts based on melamine are also possible alternative chemicals for making textiles fire-resistant. Melamine pyrophosphate is an example of a melamine product. In 2010, this product was tested as an alternative fire retardant but insufficient fire-resistant properties were discovered for some applications .\n\nZirconium salts \nZirconium salts are a technically feasible alternative fire retardant for wool. According to , zirconium salts have already been in use in the textile sector for decades, for making wool fire-resistant. In this case, the yarn itself is made fireproof. In an additional step (e.g. if wool is incorporated into a carpet), an extra fireproof coating can be added (e.g. using latex). The latter activity is often carried out in job-processing companies, where deca-BDE is used as a fire retardant .\n\nAluminium trihydroxide \nIn the carpet industry, Al(OH)3 has been used as fire retardant for the past 10-15 years. The formation of hydrates has a cooling effect . Aluminium trihydroxide is also considered to be an alternative to SCCPs as flame retardant .\n\nZinc borate \nAccording to the sector, zinc borate is only used for specific applications (e.g. heavy-duty tents). This substance is also dangerous for the environment and public health (R-phrases, e.g. R-50, R-52) .\n\nIntumescent systems\nIntumescents systems, which can either be applied as coatings or can be reacted into the textile, act by generating a highly expansive foam char in fire, by a combination of an acid released in fire which reacts with carbon (either in the textile or in the intumescent system) to accelerate char formation and a 'blower' which releases gas to expand the char. Synergists can also be included to accentuate char production and improve the char barrier qualities, e.g. metals which ceramify the char .\n\n identified intumescent systems containing ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol and melamine as possible alternatives for HBCD for textile coating.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction or prevention of emissions of hazardous substances to the environment and of waste.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWhen replacing flame retardants, a point of consideration is that substitutes may have different characteristics (e.g. freezing point, water solubility) to the chemicals to be replaced and the use of alternatives may imply process-related modifications (e.g. keeping chemicals with a lower freezing point warm when in storage).\n\nThe flame retardants used also need to comply with the requirements (demanded test standards) and to be compatible with the substrate concerned. For example, the selection of flame retardants is largely determined by the specific application (e.g. the fire-retarding mechanism that is used and the required fire-retarding properties).\n\nConsequently, the selection of flame retardants may be more technically difficult for job-processing companies due to the higher variety of activities and requirements of clients, the smaller batches that are produced, the higher number of suppliers, etc. \n\nCross-media effects \nIn some cases, alternative substances have an equally negative (or even worse) impact on the environment and no, or very little, research has been found regarding its environmental effects and health risks.\n \nFull-scale data for a Flemish case study indicate that a substantial part of the organic phosphorus, present in the waste water from the textile plant, originating from the application of DMPPA or THPC (tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride) as an active flame-retardant substance, is currently removed by the municipal sewage treatment plants (plants with indirect discharge). Biological degradation and adsorption to the sludge are considered the mechanisms responsible for this removal. However, using biological pretreatment (on site) removes organophosphorus compounds, but makes the effluent unsuitable for municipal sewer discharge (e.g. due to its Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)/P ratio it is not considered compatible with household waste water ). On the other hand, to comply with the standards for direct discharge (2 mg/l), biological treatment would need to be followed by sand filtration or activated carbon (Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)) adsorption. Investment and operating costs for such biological and additional terciary treatment are substantial .\n\nPhysico-chemical phosphorus removal is based on the principle of (co-)precipitation of phosphates. However, organic phosphorus compounds are not removed from waste water when this waste water treatment technique is implemented . There is therefore a possible displacement of the environmental problem and there may be difficulties to comply with the permit limit values for emissions of phosphorus to water.\n\nThe US EPA has assessed 31 hazard profiles of flame retardants, in terms of human health effects, aquatic toxicity and environmental fate. This helps in the selection of a flame retardant by pointing out the possible trade-offs (see Table 4.87) .\n\n\n\nTable 4.87:\tHazard profiles of some flame retardants \n\nOther sources of information are Annex VI to the CLP Regulation, the REACH registration dossiers, the CoRAP evaluations, literature, etc.\n\nIn particular, the LIFE project FLAREX  carried out an evaluation of the following alternatives:\nGuanidine phosphate (CAS number 5423-22-3).\nAmmonium polyphosphate (CAS number: 68333-79-9).\nAmmonium sulphamate (CAS number: 7773-06-0).\nCyclic phosphonate, made of two components: (5-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorian-5-yl) methyl dimethyl phosphonate P-oxide (CAS number: 41203-81-0) and Bis [5-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl) methyl] methyl phosphonate P,P'-dioxide (CAS number: 42595-45-9).\nExpandable graphite (CAS number: 7782-42-5). Expandable graphite is granular graphite in which sulphuric acid has been introduced between the layers of the graphite structure with some oxidation of the carbon. The acid is tightly held and does not leach out. Grades are available with an acidic or neutral character. During a fire, the graphite expands very quickly to over 100 times its original volume, resulting in a heat and mass transfer barrier. This effect is visible in almost any thermoplastic, and is sometimes used in combination with other flame retardants like ammonium polyphosphate (Atmospheric-pressure Plasma (APP)).\n\nFigure 4.52 below compares the results of the life-cycle assessment of alternative and conventional flame retardants. The results have been normalised to show the magnitude of the different impact categories. The normalised values represent the annual environmental impact or resource consumption that an average person contributes worldwide, expressing the results in person equivalent. The best environmental solutions are the ammonium-sulphamate-, ammonium-polyphosphate-, and expandable-graphite-based flame retardants.\n\n\nFigure 4.52:\tEnvironmental impact of various flame retardants over their life cycles (expressed in person equivalent)\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.

If not possible, flame retardants are selected considering:\n\nthe risks associated with the substances (see Section 4.1.6.1) in particular in terms of persistence and toxicity, including the potential for substitution (e.g. brominated flame retardants (see Section 4.1.6.1));\nthe composition and form of the textile materials to be treated;\nthe product specifications (e.g. combined flame retardance and oil-/water-/soil-repellence, wash durability).\n\nTechnical description\nDue to the complexity and number of possible combinations of textile substrate, finishing treatment and desired product properties, there is no overarching (one-size-fits-all) solution for suitable flame retardants. There are options available for certain specific textile products, but they are typically not transferrable to other textile products where flame resistance is required \n\nMoreover, the potential hazardousness of the flame retardants as well as their regulatory status also needs to be taken into account, by using the ECHA search tool .\n\nFor example, some brominated flame retardants (see also Section 8.1.8.4) are now strictly regulated:\n\ndecabromodiphenyl ether (deca-BDE) which is listed in Annex XVII to REACH and cannot be manufactured or placed on the market at concentrations above 0.1 % w/w (with some exemptions possible); \nhexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) which is banned by the POP Regulation  and is listed in Annex XIV to REACH and is therefore subject to authorisation .\n\nIntensive technical screening on a case-by-case basis is therefore needed to find suitable flame retardants and a number of criteria and/or product specifications may be used to carry out this screening:\n\nthe alternative chemical is halogen-free;\nit does not contain other toxic compounds (antimony, formaldehyde, etc.) that may be associated with adverse health effects in animals and humans (workers or end users);\nit does not bioaccumulate in animals and humans;\nit is easily removable from the waste water;\nit does not migrate to the surface of the substrate, via leaching or volatilisation (i.e. it is fixed on the matrix);\nin comparison with the orginal chemical, it reduces smoke formation and the smoke produced is less harmful;\nit is renewable and bio-based;\nit is recyclable.\n\n\nAdditionally, in the case of using alternatives to halogenated flame retardants (e.g. brominated flame reatardants) the important aspects to take into account are:\n\nhigher loadings and more chemicals are needed to realise the same fire-resistant properties in the textile;\nthey are more prone to hydrolysis;\nsome flame retardants are coloured (e.g. red phosphor, graphite);\nthey are more difficult to disperse in formulation;\nthey have different fire-resistant mechanisms; \nthey change the properties of the textile (e.g. hardness, plasticity); \ntheir compliance with the requirements for fire-resistant properties of top-quality applications (e.g. hotels, boats, aeroplanes, trains, cinemas, theatres).\n \n\nThe certification of chemicals under existing schemes can help ensure that some of these criteria are fulfilled. \n\nPossible fire retardants are distinguished based on their permanence in permanent fire retardants, on the one hand, and in non-permanent fire retardants on the other hand:\n\nPermanent fire retardance can be achieved by: \nchemically binding complex organophosphorus compounds to fibres by treatment with an ammoniac or a melamine derivate (see Section 4.7.4.2); \nmixing a flame retardant in melt spinning or in polymer granulates; \nmixing fibres with polymers or co-polymers that are fire-retardant (e.g. polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, acrylic-based polymer combinations with antimony trioxide, polyphosphonates; \ntreating wool with zirconium salts for example. \nNon-permanent (not wash-proof) fire retardants include: \nammonium salts from phosphate, bromide, chloride, sulphonate; \nboracic acid, borax.\n  \n\nFlame retardant preparations with less than 0.1 % formaldehyde in the formulation are used for reducing formaldehyde emissions from the flame-retardant treatments .\n\nOrganophosphorus compounds\nTextiles can be made fire-resistant by including phosphorus (P)-containing compounds, which in case of fire, act to convert carbon in the textile to a layer of char which blocks the access of oxygen to the textile, isolates against heat and limits the release of flammable gases from the textile, so preventing or limiting the fire development , .\n\nOrganic phosphorus compounds are used on the front side of textiles, so particular textile properties are thereby lost (technical limitation). However, as opposed to chemically binding complex organophosphorus compounds, non-permanent organophosphorus compounds offer very little resistance against moisture (for example they are washed out when the textile is cleaned). Thus, there are some technical limitations to the use of organophosphorus compounds. In addition, it should be noted that some organosphosphorus flame retardants are also halogenated (mostly chlorinated) and that several organophosphorus compounds have a harmonised classification under CLP for their hazard profile.\n\nProducts based on a dispersion of phosphorus-containing compounds offer environmental and economic advantages for flame-retardant finishing for 100 % PES substrates: Condensation temperatures (150-170 degC) are lower compared to the conventional thermosol process (190-200 degC) and no emissions of formaldehyde are induced. Final cleaning is not necessary. The product meets the values of the international standards such as DIN 4102 B1/B2, BS 5867 Part 2 and NFP 92-504 (M1) .\n\nMelamine\nProducts based on melamine are also possible alternative chemicals for making textiles fire-resistant. Melamine pyrophosphate is an example of a melamine product. In 2010, this product was tested as an alternative fire retardant but insufficient fire-resistant properties were discovered for some applications .\n\nZirconium salts \nZirconium salts are a technically feasible alternative fire retardant for wool. According to , zirconium salts have already been in use in the textile sector for decades, for making wool fire-resistant. In this case, the yarn itself is made fireproof. In an additional step (e.g. if wool is incorporated into a carpet), an extra fireproof coating can be added (e.g. using latex). The latter activity is often carried out in job-processing companies, where deca-BDE is used as a fire retardant .\n\nAluminium trihydroxide \nIn the carpet industry, Al(OH)3 has been used as fire retardant for the past 10-15 years. The formation of hydrates has a cooling effect . Aluminium trihydroxide is also considered to be an alternative to SCCPs as flame retardant .\n\nZinc borate \nAccording to the sector, zinc borate is only used for specific applications (e.g. heavy-duty tents). This substance is also dangerous for the environment and public health (R-phrases, e.g. R-50, R-52) .\n\nIntumescent systems\nIntumescents systems, which can either be applied as coatings or can be reacted into the textile, act by generating a highly expansive foam char in fire, by a combination of an acid released in fire which reacts with carbon (either in the textile or in the intumescent system) to accelerate char formation and a 'blower' which releases gas to expand the char. Synergists can also be included to accentuate char production and improve the char barrier qualities, e.g. metals which ceramify the char .\n\n identified intumescent systems containing ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol and melamine as possible alternatives for HBCD for textile coating.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction or prevention of emissions of hazardous substances to the environment and of waste.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWhen replacing flame retardants, a point of consideration is that substitutes may have different characteristics (e.g. freezing point, water solubility) to the chemicals to be replaced and the use of alternatives may imply process-related modifications (e.g. keeping chemicals with a lower freezing point warm when in storage).\n\nThe flame retardants used also need to comply with the requirements (demanded test standards) and to be compatible with the substrate concerned. For example, the selection of flame retardants is largely determined by the specific application (e.g. the fire-retarding mechanism that is used and the required fire-retarding properties).\n\nConsequently, the selection of flame retardants may be more technically difficult for job-processing companies due to the higher variety of activities and requirements of clients, the smaller batches that are produced, the higher number of suppliers, etc. \n\nCross-media effects \nIn some cases, alternative substances have an equally negative (or even worse) impact on the environment and no, or very little, research has been found regarding its environmental effects and health risks.\n \nFull-scale data for a Flemish case study indicate that a substantial part of the organic phosphorus, present in the waste water from the textile plant, originating from the application of DMPPA or THPC (tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride) as an active flame-retardant substance, is currently removed by the municipal sewage treatment plants (plants with indirect discharge). Biological degradation and adsorption to the sludge are considered the mechanisms responsible for this removal. However, using biological pretreatment (on site) removes organophosphorus compounds, but makes the effluent unsuitable for municipal sewer discharge (e.g. due to its Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)/Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)/P ratio it is not considered compatible with household waste water ). On the other hand, to comply with the standards for direct discharge (2 mg/l), biological treatment would need to be followed by sand filtration or activated carbon (Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)) adsorption. Investment and operating costs for such biological and additional terciary treatment are substantial .\n\nPhysico-chemical phosphorus removal is based on the principle of (co-)precipitation of phosphates. However, organic phosphorus compounds are not removed from waste water when this waste water treatment technique is implemented . There is therefore a possible displacement of the environmental problem and there may be difficulties to comply with the permit limit values for emissions of phosphorus to water.\n\nThe US EPA has assessed 31 hazard profiles of flame retardants, in terms of human health effects, aquatic toxicity and environmental fate. This helps in the selection of a flame retardant by pointing out the possible trade-offs (see Table 4.87) .\n\n\n\nTable 4.87:\tHazard profiles of some flame retardants \n\nOther sources of information are Annex VI to the CLP Regulation, the REACH registration dossiers, the CoRAP evaluations, literature, etc.\n\nIn particular, the LIFE project FLAREX  carried out an evaluation of the following alternatives:\nGuanidine phosphate (CAS number 5423-22-3).\nAmmonium polyphosphate (CAS number: 68333-79-9).\nAmmonium sulphamate (CAS number: 7773-06-0).\nCyclic phosphonate, made of two components: (5-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorian-5-yl) methyl dimethyl phosphonate P-oxide (CAS number: 41203-81-0) and Bis [5-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaphosphorinan-5-yl) methyl] methyl phosphonate P,P'-dioxide (CAS number: 42595-45-9).\nExpandable graphite (CAS number: 7782-42-5). Expandable graphite is granular graphite in which sulphuric acid has been introduced between the layers of the graphite structure with some oxidation of the carbon. The acid is tightly held and does not leach out. Grades are available with an acidic or neutral character. During a fire, the graphite expands very quickly to over 100 times its original volume, resulting in a heat and mass transfer barrier. This effect is visible in almost any thermoplastic, and is sometimes used in combination with other flame retardants like ammonium polyphosphate (Atmospheric-pressure Plasma (APP)).\n\nFigure 4.52 below compares the results of the life-cycle assessment of alternative and conventional flame retardants. The results have been normalised to show the magnitude of the different impact categories. The normalised values represent the annual environmental impact or resource consumption that an average person contributes worldwide, expressing the results in person equivalent. The best environmental solutions are the ammonium-sulphamate-, ammonium-polyphosphate-, and expandable-graphite-based flame retardants.\n\n\nFigure 4.52:\tEnvironmental impact of various flame retardants over their life cycles (expressed in person equivalent)\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.

Therefore, before being drained, this stream is used to heat the water from the second rinsing step (which is then used for making the bleaching/scouring bath as explained above).\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of water consumption.\nReduction of the volume of waste water generated.\nReduction of energy consumption.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWater consumption and waste water discharge before and after optimisation can be seen in Table 4.59 below: a 50 % reduction of the water consumption is achieved.\n\n\nTable 4.59:\tOptimisation of warp yarn scouring/bleaching: absolute and specific water consumption and waste water discharge before and after process optimisation\n\n\nThe consumption of chemicals and energy has also been reduced drastically.

Additionally, the plants have a waste gas fan and a circulation pump. The circuit has an automatic conditioning system to keep the temperature and the pH constant. The plant is vaccinated with a specific bacteria culture, able to degrade HCN into non-toxic metabolites. \n\nThe plant works as a two-step trickle reactor. In the first step, HCN contained in the waste gas is dissolved in water by intensive gas-water contact (countercurrent gas wash). Afterwards, washing water loaded with HCN is conducted to the second step (filter), where the biological elimination takes place. In the second step, the remaining HCN is dissolved, at the same time as the biological elimination. \nAfter the filter module, the cleaned waste gas is channelled to the stack and released into the atmosphere .\n\nSee  for more details on biotrickling and biofiltration.\n\nAchieved environmental benefit\nReduction of cyanide and dust emissions to air. \n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nTwo example plants achieve a HCN reduction of 30-60 %.

In example plant A, the waste water amount is approximately 10 m3/year .\n\nThe operation of the waste gas treatment system also leads to additional energy consumption: in plant A, additional energy consumption is 52 550 kWh/year. This consumption does not include the electricity consumption of the fans (54 912 kWh/year), as for workers' protection several small fans were needed before installing the waste gas abatement system, comprising similar electricity consumption .\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe biological waste gas cleaning system is applicable to new and existing plants. In existing plants, the applicability may be restricted by space availability.\n\nEconomics\nInvestment and operating costs depend on the waste gas volume treated. In example plant A, specific treatment costs for about 5 000 operation hours per year were approximately EUR 0.94 per 1 000 m3 (or EUR 0.77 per 1 000 m3 when deducting the electricity costs which were also needed for ventilation before installing the waste gas abatement system).\n\nMore details about example plant A are given below: \nInvestment costs: approximately EUR 130 000 (complete waste gas treatment system without construction costs and connecting ducts).\nAnnual costs: EUR 29 700 for a volume of waste gas treated of approximately 38 700 000 m3/year (EUR 36 400 when including the electricity costs for the fan).

Minimising the amount of size applied on the warp yarn during fabric processing is one of the most effective pollution prevention techniques for reducing the organic load caused by sizing agents.\n\nOn-line monitoring of size add-on and pre-wetting technology are now available options.\n\nThe pre-wetting technology consists of running the warp yarn through hot water before the sizing process. The warp yarn is dipped into the hot water (an additional spraying of hot water may be possible), then a squeeze roller removes the surplus water before the sizing stage. Systems with two dipping and squeezing steps are also in use.\n\nPre-wetting allows a more homogeneous sizing effect, increased adhesion of the size and reduced hairiness of the yarn. From experimental analysis, it seems that a lower 'core-sizing' effect is produced. As a result, a reduced amount of size can be applied to the fibre without affecting the weaving efficiency. In some cases, an increase in weaving efficiency can even be observed.\n\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA reduced size load on the yarn means that a lower amount of sizing agent is discharged in the water during the textile pretreatment, with immediate positive effects on the organic load of the final effluent.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nDepending on the setting of the warp beam and the type of yarn processed (e.g. density of the yarn, type of fibres in the blend), a reduction of the size add-on of about 20-50 % is possible.\n\nPre-wetting has now been tested in practice with all types of cotton yarns and blends of cotton/PES and viscose. The best results are achieved with medium to coarse yarns. Application is possible for batches of 5 000 m to 10 000 m, both for ring-spun and open-end yarns.\n\nTechnical problems may be observed in relation to the efficient measurement and control of high humidity percentages and the calibration of the wetting device .\n\nExisting sizing machines with two sizing boxes can be upgraded by using the first sizing box for pre-wetting and the second one for sizing.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe applicability may be restricted by product specifications related to yarn density or the tension required on the fibre during weaving.\n\nA high percentage of cotton fabric finished in Europe is actually imported from non EU-countries (e.g. India) where these control techniques are not yet widely used. As a result, from a practical point of view, this pollution prevention measure is more easily and immediately applicable in integrated mills than in commission finishers. In these cases, it is necessary to work with clients to eliminate these materials from the supply chain.\n\nEconomics\nSizing equipment with pre-wetting boxes is approximately EUR 25 000-75 000 more expensive than sizing equipment without a pre-wetting section. Operating costs are only marginally higher, because the additional expenditure for the pre-wetting water is compensated by the reduction in sizing liquor consumption.\n\nA direct comparison between sizing with and without pre-wetting (operational data of an Italian weaving mill) shows cost savings of about 27 %, an increase in sizing machine speed of about 22 %, and an increase in weaving efficiency of about 0.2 % .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSizing agent savings.\nIncrease of weaving efficiency.\nReduction of waste water load.\n\nExample plants\nAbout 160 pre-wetting boxes are in use worldwide .\n\nPlants from the data collection: DE042, DE049 and SE120.\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4071280_abstract", "x": 0.40446502, "y": 0.3904616, "title": "CONTROLLED METHOD FOR DEPOSITING A CHROMIUM OR CHROMIUM ALLOY LAYER ON AT LEAST ONE SUBSTRATE", "year": 2022, "text": "The present invention refers to a controlled method for depositing a chromium or chromium alloy layer on at least one substrate, the method comprising the steps\n(a) providing an aqueous deposition bath, wherein\nthe bath comprises\n- trivalent chromium ions,\n- bromide ions,\n- alkali metal cations in a total amount of 0 mol/L to 1 mol/L, based on the total volume of the deposition bath, and\nthe bath has\n- a target pH within the range from 4.1 to 7.0,\n(b) providing the at least one substrate and at least one anode,\n(c) immersing the at least one substrate in the aqueous deposition bath and applying an electrical direct current such that the chromium or chromium alloy layer is deposited on the substrate, the substrate being the cathode, wherein during or after step (c) the pH of the deposition bath is lower than the target pH,\n(d) adding NH4OH and/or NH3 during or after step (c) to the deposition bath such that the target pH of the deposition bath is recovered.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.7.7.3.1\" title=\"Acid after-treatment and reuse of the rinse bath\">\n\n<content>\nAcid after-treatment and reuse of the rinse bath\n\nDescription\nAn acidification step is added at the end of the dyeing cycle to increase the uptake of mothproofing agents and the rinse bath is reused for the next dyeing cycle.\n\nTechnical description\nThe technique illustrated in Figure 4.59 combines the following:\n\nAcid after-treatment which consists of lowering the dye liquor pH (< 4.0) at the end of the dyeing cycle.

If needed, the washing water is sent to treatment.\n\nTechnical description\nWith knitted fabrics made of cotton or cotton blends with synthetic fibres, these hydrosoluble oils can be easily washed out with water at 40 degC. This makes it possible to scour and bleach the fabric in one single step, thus saving time, water and energy.\n\nKnitted fabrics made of synthetic fibres (e.g. polyester or polyamide) are often thermofixed before being washed. If conventional oils are present on the fabric, an intense emission of fumes is generated and the remaining oil becomes more difficult to remove from the fabric in the subsequent washes.\n\nAlso in this case it is often possible to use water-soluble oils instead of conventional lubricants and to carry out the washing step before thermofixation. Washing takes place in a continuous high-efficiency washing unit (e.g. TVE-Escale type). After this step, the fabric is sent to the stenter and then dyed, washed and finished. In this way, emissions of fumes from the stenter are minimised.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nWith synthetic knitted fabric, one of the advantages of carrying out the washing step before thermofixation is that emissions to air from the stenter can be significantly reduced without the need for air emission abatement equipment.\n\nSome synthetic knitted fabrics need to be thermofixed before washing. In this case, another option is the 'dry route': the fabric is submitted to thermofixation before washing and the resulting fumes are treated in an electrostatic precipitator with subsequent recovery of the oil. The advantage is that the recovered oil can be disposed of separately, thereby reducing the contamination of the water effluent.

There are various voluntary labelling (restriction) schemes like EU Ecolabel, and schemes provided by ZDHC, OEKO-TEX, bluesign, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), AFIRM, GUT, etc. \n\nEU Ecolabel contains a list of restricted substances that are to be avoided or limited in the textile products certified according to this label .\n\nThe ZDHC (Roadmap to Zero Programme) is a coalition of fashion brands, value chain affiliates and associates dedicated to enabling the global textile, leather, apparel and footwear production chains to substitute hazardous chemicals for safer ones .\n\nThe International Association for Research and Testing in the Field of Textile and Leather Ecology (OEKO-TEX Association) is a union of 18 independent textile research and test institutes in Europe and Japan and their worldwide representative offices. The member institutes are responsible for the joint development of test methods and limit values which form the basis of the product labels (e.g. OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100, MADE IN GREEN) as well as the production site certifications (e.g. STeP - Sustainable Textile Production) and the chemical management tool DETOX TO ZERO. They are also entitled to carry out the corresponding laboratory tests and site audits. Additional services of the OEKO-TEX Association are the MySTeP database for supply chain management and the ECO PASSPORT certification for the verification of chemicals and auxiliaries .\n\nThe Global Organic Textile Standard (Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)) label was developed in 2006 through collaboration by leading carpet producers with the aim of defining requirements that are recognised worldwide and that ensure the organic status of textiles from harvesting of the raw materials through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing all the way to labelling in order to provide credible assurance to the consumer .\n\nBluesign sustainability labels and certifications are set by a private company (founded in 2000) for the production of textiles with a particular focus on chemical safety. They relate to both the companies supplying chemicals and the textile industry in order to avoid hazardous chemicals along the manufacturing process. The company also provides their members with services in chemicals management (e.g. substitution of chemicals, inventories, through the bluesign SYSTEM) .

Also, regular annual inspections of production sites are conducted .\n\nThe above-mentioned entities (ZDHC, OEKO-TEX, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), bluesign, AFIRM, GuT) carry out certification/labelling according to their restriction schemes (Manufacturing Restricted Substance Lists - MRSL). If the product is to be labelled/certified according to these schemes, certain restricted substances must be absent or present in limited concentrations from the manufacturing inputs (raw materials) and outputs (e.g. emissions, effluents) or from the finished textile products. \n\nThe main substance groups of ZDHC MRSL  are presented in Section 8.9. Process chemicals conforming with one of the four MRSL ZDHC conformance levels are reputed not to contain substances listed in the MRSL above a certain limit (corresponding to unintended contamination). The higher the conformance level, the higher the confidence that the process chemical does not contain restricted substances .\n\nSubstances are restricted for various reasons: due to environmental concerns, health and safety concerns for workers or consumers, or due to legislation. A substance restriction (in the MRSL scheme) is usually accompanied by a test (standard) method to be used to verify if a chemical is present and, if so, to ensure the chemical is below the restricted level. These labelling schemes can also be used to select raw materials and chemical suppliers (see Sections 4.1.5.1 and 4.1.6.1).\n\nSome chemical screening tools for finding suppliers of alternative chemicals or mixtures (without restricted substances) are available online (e.g. Marketplace ).\n\nIn addition to these screening tools, the regulatory context of a given susbtance may be verified by using the ECHA search tool .\n\nIn some EU Member States, schemes have been developed in cooperation with industry in order to support the permitting process and lower the pollutant loads of hazardous substances to waste waters. They may help in the selection process as screening tools. Examples of these schemes include the General Assessment Methodology in the Netherlands (RIZA Concept), the SCORE System in Denmark, the BEWAG Concept in Switzerland and the TEGEWA scheme in Germany.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced pollutant loads in the effluents from textile processing.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe change of chemicals may affect the number, scope and technological parameters of various operation steps, which would need to be adapted to ensure the required product specifications. Also, it can affect the waste water treatment needed, because it may need to be adapted for a different pollutant load. Also, it is possible that alternative chemicals are needed in higher quantities and require special treatments and accommodation of production processes - all of these could affect the environmental impact.\n\nSchemes are useful tools that allow the user to select textile dyes and auxiliaries for ecotoxicological aspects. Indirect benefits for water quality are therefore expected, although difficult to quantify/evaluate.\n\nAlternative process chemicals containing substances with a lower environmental impact may not always be possible for high technical performance textiles such as automotive, hygienic, military or protection products. Early restrictions and bans of critical substances in apparel are not always implemented for high technical performance textiles, due to lack of alternatives. To keep product quality at the necessary high level, transition periods and exception clauses are typically needed .\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified. \n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nEconomics\nIt is possible that alternative chemicals are more expensive, needed in higher quantities and require special treatment - all of these could affect the economic costs of production.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental and product safety regulation (e.g. Ecolabel).\nChemical regulation (e.g. REACH). \nMarket demands (customer pressure).\n\n\nExample plants\nMany plants from the data collection reported using labelling and certification schemes (e.g. 47 use OEKO-TEX, 13 use ZDHC, 6 bluesign, and many others).\n \nReference literature\n, , , , , , , , , , , , , \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2974791_abstract", "x": 0.67984927, "y": 0.19389811, "title": "OXIDATION CATALYST AND EXHAUST GAS PURIFICATION DEVICE USING SAME", "year": 2016, "text": " Provided is: an oxidation catalyst having excellent ability to combust diesel fuel intermittently sprayed from a nozzle disposed in an exhaust pipe, the oxidation catalyst being incorporated into an exhaust gas purification device having a diesel particulate filter (DPF) or a catalyst soot filter (CSF) for collecting particulate matter from a diesel engine; and an exhaust gas purification device that uses the oxidation catalyst.

None of these products contain N or P in their molecular structure (see Figure 4.16). In addition, the hydroxy carboxylic acids and sugar-acrylic acid copolymers are readily biodegradable.\n\n\nFigure 4.16:\tChemical structure of some N- and P-free complexing agents \n\n\nIminodi-succinic acid or salts are used for the finishing of keratine textile fibre material in oxidant-free treatment stages at pH values of 4 to 7.\n\nThe best complexing agent (in a technical, economical and ecological sense) is one that also achieves a good balance of ecological properties and effectiveness and has no detrimental effect on dyeing (demetallisation of dyes).\n\nEffectiveness is measured as the capacity to complex alkaline-earth cations, the dispersing capacity and the capacity of stabilising hydrogen peroxide.\n\nOn the ecological side, the following factors are to be considered:\n\nbiodegradability;\nbioeliminability;\nremobilisation of heavy metals;\nnitrogen content (eutrophication potential);\nphosphorus content (eutrophication potential).\n\nA qualitative assessment of the ecological properties of most common classes of complexing agents is given in Table 4.18, while Table 4.19 gives an analysis of the aspects related to their effectiveness.\n\nTable 4.18:\tQualitative assessment of commercially available complexing agents\n\nRegarding the use of phosphonates (e.g. DTPMP, HEDP). as substitutes, it is to be noted that the majority of phosphonates are not biodegradable, but bioeliminable (see Figure 4.17) .\n\nFigure 4.17:\tElimination of phosphonates in OECD tests (in %)\nDue to the very slow degradation and the small number of phosphonate-utilising species of microorganisms, it is thus assumed that phosphonates cannot be mineralised in conventional biological WWTPs, aerobically or anaerobically. Accordingly, phosphonates remain in adsorbed form in the sewage sludge in their original form and can only be completely oxidised ('mineralised') and thereby removed from the environment by combustion of the sewage sludge. Figure 4.18 shows the removal efficiencies of phosphonates in sludge adsorption .\n\n\nFigure 4.18:\tRemoval efficiencies of phosphonates in sludge adsorption (in %)\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe substitution of conventional complexing agents with the products mentioned above has the following positive effects:\n\nreduced eutrophication in the receiving water;\nimproved biodegradability of the final effluent;\nreduced risk of remobilisation of the heavy metals from sediments.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nComplexing agents are applied in many different fields in textile chemistry. Recipes and application techniques are therefore process-specific. However, the use of the optimised products mentioned above does not imply major differences with respect to conventional complexing agents.\n\n\nBioelimination and biodegradation rates for some commercial products that do not contain P and N in their molecular structure are:\n\nsugar-acrylic acid copolymer: readily biodegradable, (OECD 301F, mineralisation: 100 %; Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 194 mg/g; BOD5: 40 mg/g); \nsugar acrylic acid copolymer: readily biodegradable (OECD 301C; Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 149 mg/g); \nhydroxy carboxylic acid: bioeliminable (OECD 302B, elimination: 92 %; Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 144 mg/g; BOD5: 51 mg/g); \ncarboxylates: bioeliminable (OECD 302B, elimination > 90 %; Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 280 mg/g; BOD5: 125 mg/g); \nmodified polysaccharide: readily biodegradable (OECD 301E, biodegradability: 80 %; Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 342 mg/g; BOD5: 134 mg/g).\n\nNTA is biodegradable when treated in waste water treatment plants under nitrifying conditions (OECD 302B, elimination 98 % Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): 370 mg/g; BOD30: 270 mg/g - 'BASF, 2000'). Recent studies have shown that NTA plays a minor role, if any, in the remobilisation of heavy metals in aquatic sediments . Phosphonates are not biodegradable, but they are bioeliminable and they do not contribute to the remobilisation of heavy metals (see also Section 4.4.7.1).\nThe effectiveness of the various products in different processes has, however, to be considered when replacing conventional complexing agents with more environmentally friendly ones (see the table below).\n\n\nTable 4.19:\tEffectiveness of complexing agents\n\n\nCross-media effects\nTaking as a reference the application of conventional complexing agents, there are no cross-media effects of concern. With polyacrylate-based complexing agents, the residual monomer content in the polymer should be taken into account (note that acrylates are also widely used in large volumes in other sectors as detergent builders, thus overloading the waste water treatment plants more significantly than textile effluents do).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe complexing agents described in this section can be used in continuous and discontinuous processes.\n \nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nEconomics\nCosts for sugar-acrylic copolymers are about 30-50 % higher than using amino carboxylic acids like EDTA, DTPA or NTA because of the higher quantitities needed (for the same effect) and higher costs .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe enforcement of regulations at national and European level, together with the PARCOM recommendations and the ecolabelling schemes, are the main driving forces.\n\nExample plants\nN- and P-free complexing agents are applied in many plants worldwide. Consumption of polycarboxylates is significantly higher than for sugar-acrylic copolymers and hydrocarboxylic acids .\n\nPlant SE119 reported using saccharides instead of EDTA and UK127 uses NTA-free complexing products.\n\nReference literature\n, , , , , \n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3081292_abstract", "x": 0.5332164, "y": 0.31597453, "title": "PERFORATED ADSORBENT PARTICLES", "year": 2016, "text": "An adsorbent particle, an adsorption bed containing the adsorbent particles, a gas separation process using the adsorbent particles, and methods for making the adsorbent particles.

These processes can take place simultaneously in the same step either before or after biological treatment.\n\nFor precipitation, aluminium and iron sulphate are used. Although at high concentrations (> 500 mg/l) sulphates become aggressive against concrete, the use of sulphates is preferred to chlorides. Sulphates are easier to remove from water than chlorides. Moreover, the use of sulphates avoids the introduction of chlorides in the waste water and in the sludge to be incinerated .\n\nIron sulphate is equally effective for the removal of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and can also be considered as a coagulant (e.g. it is particularly effective for removing acrylates and other substances from pigment printing waste water). The introduction of iron has advantages (it is responsible for the activation of redox processes, it can be recycled, etc.), but it forms coloured complexes that remain in the solution, giving it a yellowish or brownish tint .\n\nThe precipitate is separated from the aqueous phase by sedimentation, dissolved air flotation, flocculation, coagulation or filtration (e.g. micro- or ultrafiltration). Precipitation, flocculation and/or coagulation agents are specifically selected in order to maximise Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and colour removal, and to minimise sludge formation. In most cases, the best performance is obtained with a combination of aluminium sulphate (precipitation), cationic organic flocculant and very low amounts of an anionic polyelectrolyte (also used for flocculation).\n\nMembrane filtration techniques (e.g. micro-, ultra-, nanofiltration) can be used to separate the precipitate from the waste water.\n\nFor more detailed descriptions of coagulation and flocculation, see Section 4.1.7.3.3.5 and for filtration, see Sections 4.1.7.3.3.9 and 4.1.7.3.4.4\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of non-biodegradable substances like heavy metals, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and colour (dyes and pigments) to water.\n\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nBefore precipitation, flocculation and coagulation, the textile waste water is equalised. However, the equalisation time can be shorter (about 12 hours) than with biological treatment. Fibres are removed by a sieve.\n\nThe dosage of precipitation agent and flocculants (e.g. for a mixed textile effluent with a Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of around 1 000 mg/l) is about:\n\naluminium sulphate: 400-600 mg/l;\ncationic organic flocculant: 50-200 mg/l;\nanionic polyelectrolyte: 1-2 mg/l.\n\nTypically, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal is only about 40-50 %. When the effluent has a high content of water-insoluble compounds (e.g. in waste water from pigment printing sections), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal is higher. Decolouration is high, typically 50-90 %, and for some dyes even more than 90 %.\n\nThe quantity of sludge produced is about 0.7-1 kg dry matter/m3 of treated waste water. Usually, the sludge is dewatered in a chamber filter press to reach a dry matter content of about 3540 % (3 kg of sludge are therefore produced for 0.5 kg of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removed).\n\nCross-media effects\nAdditional energy and chemicals are consumed for these waste water treatments.\nSludge generated in these treatments could be considered hazardous waste and needs appropriate handling (including disposal).\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nEconomics\nNo information provided. For more information, see .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental legislation.\n\nExample plants\nSee Section 4.1.7.3.3.5.\n\nReference literature\n,  \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3593889_abstract", "x": 0.6082978, "y": 0.25882927, "title": "IMPROVED ADSORPTION OF ACID GASES", "year": 2020, "text": "An adsorption process is disclosed for removal of acid gas contaminants from a liquid or gas which comprises providing an activated alumina adsorbent which is impregnated with a compound selected from the group consisting of one or more alkali metal compounds, one or more alkaline earth metal compounds, or a mixture of such compounds; contacting the liquid or gas containing acid gas contaminants with the activated alumina adsorbent to adsorb enough acid gas contaminant in the liquid or gas to lower the contaminant content of the liquid or gas, the alumina adsorbent being formed from agglomerated calcined alumina powder and provided with a mercury pore volume of pores greater than 500 angstroms at least 0.10 cc/g.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.1.7.11\" title=\"Adsorption\">\n\n<content>\nAdsorption\n\nDescription\nAdsorption is a heterogeneous reaction in which gas molecules are retained on a solid or liquid surface (the adsorbent is also referred to as a molecular sieve) that prefers specific compounds to others and thus removes them from effluent streams.

However, the remaining aromatic systems still absorb light, so some slight yellowish colour often remains.\n\nThe water-soluble cleavage products (the ones with sulphonic groups) are present in the water phase and reach the activated sludge treatment both as overflow from the anaerobic digester and as filtrate from sludge dewatering. Some naphthalene derivatives are poorly biodegradable and may still be present in the final effluent. For this reason, the supernatant needs to be subsequently treated in an activated sludge system.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAnaerobic treatments reach colour removal efficiencies of more than 90 % with azo dyes (determined as reduction of spectral absorption coefficients at the wavelengths 436 nm, 525 nm and 620 nm) .\n\nAlso with printing pastes containing natural thickeners, such as alginates or galactomannans, there is a conversion to biogas thanks to degradation of these biopolymers.\n\nAlthough the quantity of the concentrates mentioned represents a small percentage of the total discharged waste water (only a few tonnes per week even for large mills), there are cases in which the total residual colour in the effluent of treatment plants could be reduced by about 50 %.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nIn order to derive the most benefit from anaerobic treatment, this technique should be applied in combination with process-integrated techniques aimed at minimising padding liquors and printing paste residues. Moreover, it is important to separate at source the residual padding liquors from other streams in order to keep them concentrated.\n\nThe dosage of reactive printing paste should not exceed 10 g/kg of sludge because of possible inhibition effects on the anaerobic process. Laboratory tests may assist with determination of inhibition effects.\n\nPadding liquors and printing pastes with heavy-metal-containing dyestuffs are separated unless the sludge resulting from the anaerobic treatment is incinerated or disposed of in appropriate landfill .\n\nCross-media effects\nThe reductive cleavage of the azo bonds leads to aromatic amines. As for the potential for release of carcinogenic aromatic amines, investigations carried out so far have not confirmed this fear . Moreover, the supernatant from the anaerobic treatment is normally treated with activated sludge.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique can be applied to both new and existing installations.\n\nAnaerobic treatment is particularly suitable for azo dyestuffs, which represent 50 % of the colourants currently available on the market.\n\nHowever, other chromophoric systems cannot be treated substantially. Vat dyes for example are reduced to the colourless form, but this process is reversible.\n\nPigment printing pastes cannot be treated in anaerobic digesters because all components are non-biodegradable and scaling problems occur because of polymer binders.\n\nIn conclusion, even if anaerobic treatments reach efficencies of 90 % with azo dyes, for companies using a broader range of dyes this technique has an average overall efficiency.\n\nEconomics\nThe known cost for anaerobic treatment in municipal anaerobic digesters varies between EUR 30 and EUR 60 per tonne of padding liquor or printing paste .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nCompliance with existing environmental standards for emissions to water (e.g. for colour).\nExample plants\nResidual padding liquors for dyeing are treated in the anaerobic digester of the municipal waste water treatment plant of Heidenheim, D-Heidenheim.\n\nPlants CZ019 (printing and dyeing) and FR134 (dyeing and functional finishing) report using anaerobic treatment for waste water treatment.\n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "2926887_abstract", "x": 0.63254195, "y": 0.35342455, "title": "SEPARATION MEMBRANE MODULE", "year": 2015, "text": "The present invention provides a high-efficiency separation-membrane module that includes separation membranes that flutter without damaging the membranes even though a pocket separation-membrane element without a support plate is used, and that discourages sludge attachment.

In the application of chrome dyes, inefficient chroming methods can lead to the discharge of chromium in spent dye liquors (see also 'oxidising agents' in Section 2.7.8.1). \n\nIn order to minimise the amount of residual chromium in the final effluent, much attention is given to the low-chrome (stoichiometric) and ultra-low- (substoichiometric) chrome dyeing techniques, where only the minimum amount of dichromate required to form the dye complex in the fibre is dosed.\n\nThe so-called low-chrome dyeing technology consists of the stoichiometric dosage of chrome (up to a maximum of 1.5 % o.w.f.) together with careful pH control (3.5-3.8) and addition of a reducing agent, which assists in the conversion of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and promotes its exhaustion onto the fibre .\n \nBy the use of low-chrome techniques it is possible to reduce residual Cr(III) in the spent chroming bath from about 200 mg/l (typical of the conventional process) to about 5 mg/l in practical mill conditions.

Chrome is dosed substoichiometrically, based on the dye uptake of the fibre.\n\nWith ultra-low-chroming techniques additional measures are applied, compared to the low-chrome process, in order to ensure maximum exhaustion of the dye bath. If the dye bath exhaustion is incomplete before chroming, the residual dye in the liquor will be chromed and remain in the liquor, adding to the discharged chromium. By ensuring maximum dye exhaustion, contamination from this source can be reduced and this will also give maximum fastness performance. Dye bath exhaustion can be improved by ensuring that the dye bath pH is sufficiently low or by allowing the dye bath to cool to 80-90 degC at the end of the dyeing stage.

The required amount of dichromate is fed directly to the dyeing machine through pipework (no manual transfer, no human contact, no losses). The system is fitted with control devices for the volumetric control of the delivered quantities, which switch the entire system into emergency mode if normal operating parameters are breached .\n\nIn addition, special safety precautions are recommended for the storage of dichromate. The containers for the solution of sodium dichromate are stored within isolated bunded areas in order to contain potential spillage and avoid interaction with other chemicals (in case of spillage).\n\nFor maximum chroming efficiency, it is essential to eliminate from the chroming bath any chemicals that will inhibit the chromium/dye interaction.

It can be roughly estimated that, in fabric finishing, each textile substrate is treated on average 2.5 times in a stenter.\n\nThe main energy needs for a stenter are for air heating and evaporation. It is therefore fundamental that the fabric moisture content be minimised before the fabric enters the stenter and that the exhaust airflow within the oven be reduced. For more details on stenters operation, see Section 8.4.\n\nEnergy savings in stenters can be achieved by applying the following techniques.\n\nMechanical dewatering of the fabric\nThe water content of the incoming fabric can be minimised using dewatering equipment such as centrifugation, vacuum extraction systems, optimised squeezing rollers. (the latter is less efficient but less energy-consuming). Up to 15 % energy savings in the stenter (depending on the type of substrate) can be obtained if the moisture content of the fabric is reduced from 60 % to 50 % before it enters the stenter.\n\nFor synthetic fibres, vacuum extraction achieves approximately 20 % better dewatering efficiency compared to squeezing rollers; the opposite is true for cotton fibres, where squeezing rollers prove more efficient (see Figure 4.6) , .\n\nIn vacuum extraction, the air flow through textile fabrics is mainly affected by the fabric structure, e.g. its tightness, porosity and air permeability. For example, for woven fabrics with different porosities dried by the vacuum extraction method, it was found that the lower the porosity or the lower the air permeability, the higher the water removal effects with a lower energy requirement .\nFigure 4.6:\tResidual moisture of different fabrics (cotton - synthetic blends) related to the mechanical dewatering equipment used\n\n\nOptimising exhaust airflow \nExhaust airflow optimisation is another determining factor. Many stenters are still poorly controlled, relying on manual exhaust adjustment and operator estimation of fabric dryness. For optimum performance, exhaust humidity is maintained between 0.1 kg and 0.15 kg water/kg of dry air. It is not unusual to find that less efficient stenters have an exhaust humidity of only 0.05 kg water/kg of dry air, indicating that the exhaust volume is too high and excessive energy is being used to heat air . Energy consumption for air heating can reach up to 60 % of the total energy consumption, if the airflow is not monitored .\n\nEquipment is available (dampers and variable-speed fans) which will automatically adjust the exhaust airflow according to the moisture content of the exhaust air or according to the moisture content or temperature of the fabric after the process. A reduction of fresh air consumption from 10 kg fresh air/kg of textile to 5 kg fresh air/kg of textile results in a 57 % energy saving , \n\nThe exhaust dampers are partially or fully closed during idling time (changing of batches, etc.) \n\nInsulation\nProper insulation of stenter encasement reduces heat losses to a considerable extent. Savings in energy consumption of 20 % can be achieved if the insulation thickness is increased from 120 mm to 150 mm (provided that the same insulation material is used).\n\nThe insulation of end sections of cylinder dryers can reduce heat waste, thereby saving fuel. This measure, however, is more practical for cylinders with a diameter of one metre or more. For small-diameter cylinders, this may not be practicable since the steam pipe, condensate pipe and safety valve get in the way .\n\nOptimising burner efficiency \nWith optimised firing systems and sufficient maintenance of burners in directly heated stenters, the methane emissions can be minimised. A typical range for an optimised burner is 10-15 g methane (calculated as organic carbon)/h, but it has to be taken into account that methane emissions from burners are strongly linked to actual burner capacity.\n\nStenters are maintained by specialised companies at regular intervals, the burner air inlet is regularly checked for blocking by lint or oil, pipework is cleaned to remove precipitates and burners are adjusted by specialists. \n\nThe following parts are typically included in the maintenance programme :\n\nManagement instruction for burner maintenance and control\nBurner\nWeekly:\nVisual inspection of the burners.\nChecking of the intake filter on the burner, cleaning / replacement when necessary.\nAnnually:\nAnnual functional test, measurement and adjustment. This also includes a safety check of the temperature monitor or the temperature safety switch to ensure that if the temperature control of the burner does not work, no temperature overheating will occur.\nBurner lines:\nLeakage check(s)\nManagement instruction for exhaust air ducts maintenance and control\nWeekly visual inspection and, if required, cleaning of the exhaust air ducts yearly. \n\nOptimised air circulation\nThe circulation of hot air within the stenter is optimised: the number of air injection nozzles is adapted to the width of the fabric, the distance between nozzles and fabric is as short as possible, and the pressure drop caused by the stenter internal components is as small as possible.\n\n\nAvoiding overdrying\nFibres have a natural moisture level (see Table 4.9) below which it is useless to dry them. It is therefore important to monitor the moisture content of the fabric and to adapt the residence time of the fabric in the stenter/dryer so that the natural moisture level is not exceeded. Hand-held moisture meters can be used with a roller sensor to monitor the moisture content of fabrics leaving the stenters or drying cylinders .\n\n\nTable 4.9:\tNatural moisture level of some fibres\n\n\nAdvanced process monitoring and control of the stenters\nThe stenter operation and the energy consumption are optimised by measuring and controlling the following parameters :\n\nhumidity content and temperature of the inlet air;\nexhaust air humidity and temperature, in order to load exhaust air most efficiently with humidity; drying efficiency is optimised by an appropriate humidity content (e.g. above 0.1 kg water/kg dry air); this reduces the volume of hot exhaust air, and thus energy losses, dramatically;\nresidual moisture of the fabric to avoid overdrying and overheating of fabric; \nfabric and air temperature; several fabric temperature sensors placed inside the stenter along with the fabric provide a good system for the supervision and optimisation of heat treatment processes, mainly for controlling the residence time of the fabric in the stenter.\nThe exhaust airflow is adjusted to optimise drying efficiency and is reduced during idle periods of the drying equipment.\n\nOptimal scheduling of batches\nCareful scheduling of fabric batches arriving at the stenters or cylinder dryers can reduce idling time, thereby saving energy .\n\nProper scheduling in finishing minimises machine stops and heating-up/cooling-down steps and is therefore a prerequisite for saving energy.\n\nAvoiding loss of latent heat in cylinder dryers\nThe cylinder dryers are regularly maintained to avoid steam leaks. The condensate is recovered and returned to the boiler. In addition, flash steam which is produced when condensate is reduced to atmospheric pressure can be recovered as low-pressure steam, and used to heat water or other low-pressure steam processes .\n\nUsing high-frequency drying\nEnergy savings could be accomplished by switching from conventional dryers to low-pressure (Low-pressure (LP)) high-frequency drying (microwave or radio frequency). The Low-pressure (LP) high-frequency drying method features good drying efficiency and the capability to prevent products from overdrying, which often happens in convection dryers. \n,  \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSavings in energy consumption and therefore minimisation of emissions associated with energy production are the main environmental advantages.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe following data describe an optimised air-to-textile ratio in a stenter: \n\n\nIn principle, the waste gas humidity should be as high as possible but 20 % humidity can rarely be achieved due to condensation. A level of 12-15 % humidity in waste gas is commonly found in practice .\n\nMinimising energy consumption in the stenters, especially if heat recovery systems are installed, requires adequate maintenance (cleaning of the heat exchanger and stenter machinery, checking of control/monitoring devices, adjusting of burners, etc.)\n\nData collected on specific energy consumption of thermal treatment is described in Section 3.6.2.12. When applying this technique, the specific energy consumption ranges from 0.5 MWh/t to 4.4 MWh/t. \n\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nAll techniques described are applicable to new installations. For existing equipment, the applicability is in some cases limited. For example, improving stenter insulation is not always practicable, although on some older machines it may be cost-effective to insulate the roof panels. \n\nThe installation of high-frequency drying systems may be applicable only to new plants and major plant upgrades. Furthermore, it may not be applicable to textile materials containing metallic parts or fibres.\n\nEconomics\nExamples of investment costs are given in Table 4.10.\n\n\nTable 4.10:\tInvestment costs for energy-saving measures\n\n\nAs RF and microwave systems operate on electric power, the unit of energy cost is usually higher than for conventional dryers. However, the energy efficiency of RF and microwave systems are normally much higher than for conventional systems, which tends to offset the higher energy unit cost .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nMinimisation of energy consumption (and therefore costs) is the main reason to retrofit optimised stenter technology. \n\nExample plants\nIn total, 33 plants from the data collection apply techniques to minimise the energy consumption of stenter frames.\n\nThe indirect heating system based on a flue-gas/air exchanger is installed in 15 plants from the data collection.

They are all cascade polymers of different side- or branch extensions.\n\nThe oil- and soil-repellent dendrimer finishes include a fluorocarbon resin in their structure, while the fluorocarbon-free dendrimers only provide water repellency. Compared to other PFAS-based repellents, the fluorine content of the oleophobic dendrimer finishes is reduced. The fluorocarbon-free dendrimers provide water repellency through closely packed surface groups, i.e. methyl groups.\n\nCommonly, these finishes are applied as two-component systems consisting of an emulsion containing the dendrimers and a solution containing a cross-linking substance providing the fixation to the fibre. Fluorocarbon-free dendrimers are based on hydrocarbon or polyurethane chemistry. Cross-linking is commonly achieved by chemical binding of the dendrimers with isocyanates to the fibre. Glycols are added as solvents and cationic surfactants in small amounts act as emulsifiers .\n\nAn example of a marketed product consists of polyurethane-dendrimer (hyperbranched polymers) with hydrophobic end groups connected to patented comb polymers (linear), which are fixed to the fibre surface (see Figure 4.56 below).\n\nFigure 4.56:\tPrinciple of a marketed dendrimer\n\n\nIn the case of knitted polyester, this technology has provided very good results for water repellence, achieving the same water repellence grade and washing fastness as that obtained for the PFC C8 and C6 products.\n\nIn the case of wool, the product does not meet either water or oil repellence requirements after washing. Indeed, the water repellence achieved is similar to PFC C6, but the washing fastness is lower, because this product is not resistant to dry cleaning.\n\nThe dendrimers technically have some advantages in providing soft textiles and excellent low-temperature curing .\n\nSilicone-based repellents\nSilicone repellents are also commonly used in the textile industry to give water repellence to fabrics. These finishing agents are generally made of elastomeric polydimethylsiloxanes (PMDS) which can coat the fabric surface after curing. The structure obtained after finishing by padding of the fabric surface is a three-dimensional, flexible and hydrophobic layer bonded to the fabric's fibres (see Figure 4.57). It should be noted that silicone repellents' finishing agents have moderate washing fastness due to the hydrolysis of the siloxane during laundry. \n\n\nFigure 4.57:\tPrinciple of polydimethylsiloxanes on a fibre surface\n\n\nVarious types of silicone polymers based on PDMS have been shown to contain residual levels of cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes due to residues from manufacturing processes, e.g. octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5). \n\nStudies on related PDMS polymers showed a relatively fast depolymerisation process by hydrolytic degradation in soil. Thereby silanols of lower molecular weight are formed and further hydrolysis predominantly proceeds to yield dimethylsilanediol (DMSD) and trimethylsilanol (TMS) .\n\nThe silicone-based repellents have been tested on a non-woven polyester fabric (automotive), obtaining a high level of water repellence\n\nAchieved environmental benefit\nReduction or prevention of emissions of hazardous substances to the environment and of waste.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe alternative water and oil repellents do not need particular conditions; they can be applied by padding like conventional finishes or by spraying directly onto fabric surfaces.

The finish forms an array of microscopic polymer domains on the fabric surface (not a film or coating) with the fluorinated chains perpendicular to the fabric surface and close enough to one another to act like a continuous surface, thus preventing water and oils from reaching the fabric .\n\nFor textiles requiring only a water-repellent finish without any soil- and oil-repellent effects, fluorine-free water-repellent agents with a different chemical basis are used depending on the specified finish requirements, e.g. paraffin formulations, polysiloxanes, modified melamine resins or polyurethanes or highly branched fluorine-free polymers .\n\nPreparations with less than 0.1 % formaldehyde in the formulation are used for reducing formaldehyde emissions from the water- and oil-repellent treatments .\n\nTable 4.88 shows major categories of non-fluorine alternatives available on the market.\n\n\n\nTable 4.88:\tOverview of non-fluorine alternatives\n\n\nDendrimers and hyperbranched polymers\nThe hyperbranched polymers group includes dendrimers, dendrons, dendrigraft polymers and branched polymers. They are all cascade polymers of different side- or branch extensions.\n\nThe oil- and soil-repellent dendrimer finishes include a fluorocarbon resin in their structure, while the fluorocarbon-free dendrimers only provide water repellency. Compared to other PFAS-based repellents, the fluorine content of the oleophobic dendrimer finishes is reduced. The fluorocarbon-free dendrimers provide water repellency through closely packed surface groups, i.e. methyl groups.\n\nCommonly, these finishes are applied as two-component systems consisting of an emulsion containing the dendrimers and a solution containing a cross-linking substance providing the fixation to the fibre. Fluorocarbon-free dendrimers are based on hydrocarbon or polyurethane chemistry. Cross-linking is commonly achieved by chemical binding of the dendrimers with isocyanates to the fibre. Glycols are added as solvents and cationic surfactants in small amounts act as emulsifiers .\n\nAn example of a marketed product consists of polyurethane-dendrimer (hyperbranched polymers) with hydrophobic end groups connected to patented comb polymers (linear), which are fixed to the fibre surface (see Figure 4.56 below).\n\nFigure 4.56:\tPrinciple of a marketed dendrimer\n\n\nIn the case of knitted polyester, this technology has provided very good results for water repellence, achieving the same water repellence grade and washing fastness as that obtained for the PFC C8 and C6 products.\n\nIn the case of wool, the product does not meet either water or oil repellence requirements after washing. Indeed, the water repellence achieved is similar to PFC C6, but the washing fastness is lower, because this product is not resistant to dry cleaning.\n\nThe dendrimers technically have some advantages in providing soft textiles and excellent low-temperature curing .\n\nSilicone-based repellents\nSilicone repellents are also commonly used in the textile industry to give water repellence to fabrics. These finishing agents are generally made of elastomeric polydimethylsiloxanes (PMDS) which can coat the fabric surface after curing. The structure obtained after finishing by padding of the fabric surface is a three-dimensional, flexible and hydrophobic layer bonded to the fabric's fibres (see Figure 4.57). It should be noted that silicone repellents' finishing agents have moderate washing fastness due to the hydrolysis of the siloxane during laundry. \n\n\nFigure 4.57:\tPrinciple of polydimethylsiloxanes on a fibre surface\n\n\nVarious types of silicone polymers based on PDMS have been shown to contain residual levels of cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes due to residues from manufacturing processes, e.g. octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5). \n\nStudies on related PDMS polymers showed a relatively fast depolymerisation process by hydrolytic degradation in soil. Thereby silanols of lower molecular weight are formed and further hydrolysis predominantly proceeds to yield dimethylsilanediol (DMSD) and trimethylsilanol (TMS) .\n\nThe silicone-based repellents have been tested on a non-woven polyester fabric (automotive), obtaining a high level of water repellence\n\nAchieved environmental benefit\nReduction or prevention of emissions of hazardous substances to the environment and of waste.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe alternative water and oil repellents do not need particular conditions; they can be applied by padding like conventional finishes or by spraying directly onto fabric surfaces.

On the other hand, sodium silicate gives rise to a number of problems such as the formation of silicate deposits on the textile surface and on the equipment, increased salt in the effluent, etc.\n\nSilicate-free highly concentrated aqueous alkali solutions have been developed and are now available on the market. They are ready-made products (carefully adjusted mixture of alkali in aqueous solution), which can be easily applied with modern dosing systems. They are particularly suitable for the cold pad-batch process.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced emissions to water.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe following advantages are achievable:\n\nno residues of alkali in the preparation tank because, unlike with sodium silicate, the alkali can be added as ready-made solution and does not need to be prepared;\nno formation of difficult-to-wash-off deposits on the substrate and on the equipment;\nno need for additional auxiliaries in the padding liquor to avoid the formation of deposits;\nlower electrolyte content in the effluent;\npossibility of using membrane techniques in waste water treatment (no crystallisation in filters, pipes and valves and no membrane blocking, which is the case with sodium silicate).\n\nMembrane pumps such as the sera-pumps with a 4:1 ratio between the alkali solution and the dyestuffs solution are suitable for the application of the product .\n\nFigure 4.43 shows a typical dosing curve. Using a curve instead of the conventional alkali addition steps brings additional advantages in terms of increased reproducibility .\n\n\nFigure 4.43:\tDosing curve for ready-made alkali solution \nThe ready-made alkali solutions are designed for modern minimum-volume troughs (see Section 4.5.1.1), where the pad liquor exchange time is very short and where extremely long pad liquor stability is not needed, as the absence of sodium silicate affects the stability of the pad liquor. More efficient process control (e.g. temperature control of the dyeing liquor) is therefore required.\n\nCross-media effects\nNone identified.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThe technique is applicable to both existing and new installations .\n\nIt may not be applicable for dyeing with dark shades, where an add-on of silicate to the formulation is needed .\n\nEconomics\nReady-made alkali solutions are more expensive than the conventional fixation methods and additional process control implies investment costs.\n\nHowever, the following economic benefits are induced :\n\nThe investment in advanced dosing systems is lower for the silicate-free method because only two dosing units are needed (one for the dyestuff solution and one for the ready-made alkali solution), while with the conventional fixation methods based on silicate, three dosing units are required (one for the dyestuff solution, one for the silicate and one for the alkali). The investment cost for one dosing unit is around EUR 12 000.\nThere is no need to change the rubbers of the padder at short time intervals because of silicate deposit formation. The cost for removing the rubber of a padder is estimated at around EUR 7 000-10 000.\nThe lower electrolyte content of the liquor reduces the substantivity of the hydrolysed dyestuffs, which is therefore easier to wash off. This results in lower energy and water consumption in the washing-off step of the process.\nThe productivity of the padders and washing ranges is higher.\nThere is a better reproducibility of the process thanks to monitored process conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, a reduction of the total process costs is achieved, compared to the conventional fixation methods.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nProduct quality and reproducibility of the process.\n\nExample plants\nPlants from the data collection: FR131, IT059, IT070, IT094 and PT114.\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3754764_abstract", "x": 0.6770072, "y": 0.28573298, "title": "METHOD AND DEVICE FOR PREPARING LITHIUM TRANSITION METAL OXIDE", "year": 2020, "text": "The present disclosure provides a method for preparing a transition metal lithium oxide, comprising steps of: A) mixing a lithium salt and a transition metal compound, and performing a pretreatment to obtain a precursor; wherein the pretreatment temperature is 100-300\u00b0C; and the pretreatment time is 1-10h; B) precalcining the precursor to obtain an intermediate; and C) continuously feeding the intermediate into a feed port of a moving bed reactor, and calcining, to obtain a transition metal lithium oxide.

The aim of cationisation is to produce cationic sites on the cellulose fibres by attaching cationic monomers or polymers of low molecular weight to the cellulose molecules. The affinity of cotton fibre for reactive dyes and the exhaustion of those dyes in dyeing is thereby increased. Furthermore, the consumption of salt in reactive dyeing is greatly reduced.\n\nThe cationisation solution may be applied in different ways (exhaustion, pad-batch, pad-steam, pad-dry or a combination thereof) and to different susbtrates (fibre, yarn or fabric). The efficiency of the reaction and the resulting degree of cationisation are directly related to the amount of cationisation agent applied and the substrate and process utilised . \n\nTypical cationic agents used are amines and/or quaternary ammonium compounds. Historically 3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propyltrimethylammonium chloride (CHPTAC) was used as the cationisation agent, but, due to the carcinogenic intermediate 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (EPTAC), the alternative substances such as chitosan derivatives with amino groups, polyamindiamine dendrimers (e.g. PAMAM, containing four amine groups), cationic polymers and others have been developed ,\n, , .\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced pollutant loads (i.e. salinity, dyes, and heavy metals) in the effluents from reactive dyeing of cotton.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe cationisation pretreatment allows reactive dyeing of cotton with low- or zero- salt or alkali consumption; due to higher dye fixation, the dosed dyes are almost completely exhausted. The salinity of the effluent and the load of the unfixed dyes (and consequently heavy metals as part of the dye molecules) are significantly reduced.\n\nPolymer-type cationisation preparations are typically almost completely exhausted from the spent baths during the cationisation pretreatment step and only negligible amounts remain in the effluents. It is not clear if these remaining cationisation agents can produce intermediary substances that are hazardous or could be classified as carcinogenic. However, such intermediates are expected to be neutralised after mixing with effluents from other wet treatment processes in installation's common waste water treatment plant. Typically the remains of cationisation polymers would be neutralised to non-toxic compounds (e.g. salts) by reacting with the anionic species (e.g. from various anionic auxiliaries used in other wet treatment processes) .\n\nTypically, cationisation pre-treatment prolongs the total dyeing time. High reuse/recirculation of dyeing effluents due to the absence of salt and heavy metals is possible in the installations using this treatment step.\n\nSince cationisation agents may be hazardous compounds additional advanced pretreatment (e.g. coagulation/flocculation, adsorption - for more details see Sections 4.1.7.2 and 4.1.7.4) would be used for their removal from the effluent prior to the biological treatment. For concentrated baths from pad-batch application separate collection and disposal of these waste water streams may be applied , .\n\nCross-media effects\nCationisation is additional operation in the dyeing process. Additional chemicals would be required for the cationisation pretreatment and advanced pretreatment of waste water streams may be required.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique. However, significantly reduced light fastness, especially dyeing with medium to high demands on light fastness, may not possible .\nEconomics\nThe technique induces investment costs for the cationisation unit or purchase costs for the cationic cotton. The investment costs for the cationisation unit are less than USD 200 000 and the payback time is 2 years .\n\nThe savings from reducing the consumption of dyes are around 40-45%, compared to conventional reactive dyeing, depending on the dyeing deepness (shade).\n\nFurther savings arise from reduced water consumption for the dyeing process, because of higher water reuse/recirculation due to absence of salt and heavy metals.\n\nAdditional costs may occur if advanced pretreatment of the waste water streams are required to remove the remaining cationisation agents and their degradation products.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nEnvironmental legislation (emission limit values, environmental quality standards).\nLower water consumption (due to higher water reuse/recirculation).\nEconomics (reduced overall costs of dyeing).\nImproved product quality (colour levelness and fastness which are difficult or impossible to attain by conventional dyeing without this pretreatment).\n\nExample plants\nCationisation preparations from several producers are available.

Grease is recovered, water is partially recycled to scouring and dirt is sent to further treatment.\n\nTechnical description\nAs already described in Section 2.3.1.1 (see Figure 2.4), a wool scouring plant operating in countercurrent mode normally produces three liquid waste streams:\n\na dirt-rich flow, from the bottoms of the scouring bowls;\na less concentrated dirty flow, from the bottoms of the rinse bowls;\na grease-rich flow, from the top of the first scouring bowl, or from the side tank of the first scouring bowl, which receives the liquor removed from the wool as it exits the bowl through the squeeze press.\n\nAll of these flows can be partially decontaminated and recycled to the scouring plant, by means of grease recovery and dirt removal loops.\n\nThere is no consensus on the best way to operate the loop(s). Some mills prefer to treat the dirt-rich flow and the grease-rich flow separately, whilst others combine the two streams and carry out sequential treatment, first for dirt removal, then for grease recovery.\n\nFor grease recovery, plate-type centrifuges are employed. They are usually protected from the abrasive effects of dirt by hydrocyclones in cases where separate rather than sequential grease recovery and dirt removal is practised. The centrifuge produces a top phase, known as 'cream', which is grease containing a small amount of water. This 'cream' is usually passed to a secondary centrifuge, which produces an upper, a lower and a middle phase. The upper phase consists of anhydrous grease, which can be sold as a by-product. The bottom phase is high in dirt and may be passed to the input side of the dirt recovery loop, or to the effluent treatment plant. The middle phase is impoverished in both grease and dirt and may be completely or partially recycled to the scouring plant, by addition to the first scouring bowl. A portion of the middle phase may flow to effluent treatment.\n\nDirt removal may employ gravity settling tanks, hydrocyclones or decanter centrifuges - or combinations of these methods.\n\nIn the case of Plant CZ016, the volume of waste water discharged is further reduced by evaporation. The remaining condensates are treated by stripping, then by oxidation with ozone for deodorisation before being resued in the process.\n\nIn mills with more than one scouring line, the lines normally share dirt removal/grease recovery facilities.\n\nFor fine and extra-fine wool, when carried out using machinery that has a separate continuous sludge flow output, the wool grease recovery loop also allows the elimination of the very fine dirt fraction without the need for a separate loop for dirt removal.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of water and energy consumption.\nReduced waste water generation.\nReduction of emissions to water.\nResource efficiency.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThe implementation of dirt removal/grease recovery loops allows the following:\n\nA reduction in water consumption ranging from a minimum of 25 % to a maximum of more than 50 %, taking as a reference point the consumption of water of a conventional plant operating countercurrently (between 5 l/kg and 10 l/kg of greasy wool).\nA reduction in energy consumption equivalent to the amount of thermal energy carried by the recycled liquor (the liquor temperature is generally about 60 degC).\nThe production of a valuable by-product: wool grease.\nA reduction in detergent and detergent builder consumption proportional to the water savings achieved.\nThe conversion of suspended dirt into spadeable sludge.\nA reduction of the load (oxygen-demanding substances and suspended solids) sent to the effluent treatment plant, which means a reduction in the consumption of energy and chemicals for the treatment of the waste water. This reduction is proportional to the dirt removal and grease recovery rate achieved. \n\nOf the six wool scourers which took part in the data collection, four reported a grease recovery rate between 11 g/kg and 15 g/kg of raw wool for coarse wool and between 50 g/kg and 60 g/kg of raw wool for extra- and super-fine wool (see Section 3.7.1) .\n\nThere is probably a maximum amount of grease that can be recovered centrifugally, which is governed by the ratio between hydrophobic and less hydrophobic grease (top grease and oxidised grease) present on the scoured wool .\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumption of energy by the centrifuges is one cross-media effect.\n\nThe Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentration of the effluent resulting from the dirt removal and grease recovery loop may be too high for on-site aerobic treatment plants. The installation of coagulation/flocculation or anaerobic biological treatment before the aerobic biological plant would overcome this problem.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nGenerally, there are no technical restrictions to the applicability of this technique.\n\nThis measure is applicable in all new and most existing wool scouring plants.\n\nEconomics\nA calculation of the net economic benefit per tonne of greasy wool can be done, based on the assumptions reported in Table 4.51. The unit costs refer to the situation in the UK at the time of the research (1999); therefore they can only be indicative of the European situation at that time.\n\n\nTable 4.51:\tEstimate of the economic benefits achievable with the installation of integrated dirt removal/grease recovery loops\n\n\nIt is estimated that the installation of dirt removal/grease recovery loops at a mill processing 15 000 tonnes to 25 000 tonnes per year of greasy wool would cost between EUR 400 000 and EUR 800 000, depending on the nature, quality and capacity of the particular system chosen. The payback time for the installation, ignoring the benefits of reduced effluent disposal costs, would be between 2.04 and 4.08 years .\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces are economic benefit for medium and large mills, especially those processing fine (high grease content) wools. Economic benefit derives from savings in water, energy, sewage treatment and chemical costs and the proceeds from sales of wool grease. Disincentives are the high capital cost, high maintenance costs and complexity.\n\nExample plants\nPlants from the data collection: CZ016, IT075, IT076, UK128 and UK129. In particular, Plant CZ016 uses evaporation to reduce even further the amount of waste water discharged.\n\nReference literature\n, \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3730631_abstract", "x": 0.7170897, "y": 0.30647781, "title": "BLAST FURNACE STOVE DEVICE AND METHOD FOR OPERATING BLAST FURNACE STOVE DEVICE", "year": 2020, "text": "A hot-blast stove system (1) includes: a hot-blast stove (4) for performing an on-blast operation for delivering a hot blast to a blast furnace (2) and an on-gas operation for combusting a fuel gas in the hot-blast stove; a fuel gas supply line (5) for supplying a BFG produced by the blast furnace (2) to the hot-blast stove (4) as the fuel gas; and a blower (52) provided in the fuel gas supply line (5) and configured to raise a pressure of the BFG.

This limit is set by the thermochemical and kinetic conditions in the raceway. Plastics can contain Cl and heavy metals like Hg, Cd, Pb and Zn. The concentration level of these elements in the plastics influences the composition of the gaseous and particulate bound compounds in the Blast Furnace (BF) gas and the dust separation behaviour in the Blast Furnace (BF) gas cleaning system. As a result of this, plastic should meet certain input criteria for these elements. A small modification of the scrubber parameters allows these concentration levels in the Blast Furnace (BF) gas to be kept comparable to the standard conditions of operation when plastics are not injected.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn the Blast Furnace (BF) the plastics substitute a part of the reducing agents such as coke and thus the emissions associated with coke production are prevented.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe ratio for plastics is dependant upon the relative amounts of carbon and hydrogen that can be derived from the plastic injected. A kilogram of plastic can replace about 0.75 kg of coke. A reduction of the hot metal sulphur content is possible because plastics have a lower sulphur input than heavy oil or coke. The consumption of desulphurisation agents (e.g. lime, CaC2, Mg) at the pretreatment desulphurisation process of the hot metal can be reduced.\n\nDepending on the composition of the wastes used (e.g. shredder light fraction), the amount of Cr, Cu, Ni and Mo in the Blast Furnace (BF) gas may increase.\n\nOperational data\nVoestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria received final permission for the injection of 220 000 tonnes of plastics per year in 2005 and is increasing the capacity up to a level of 70 kg/t hot metal.

No fixed or minimum period of maintenance can be set. Maintenance should follow a systematic programme and be carried out by specially-trained maintenance personnel (e.g. during two shifts). \n\nThe maintenance programme at ArcelorMittal, Ghent, Belgium is described below as an example. There, each oven receives a complete overhaul after five years on average, depending on the state of the ovens. This entails leaving the oven empty for a week while the following operations are carried out:\n\nperiodic inspection of the ovens (e.g. one oven per day)\ndegraphitising of all deposits within the chamber (walls, ceiling, ascension pipes)\noxythermic welding of cracks, holes and surface damage of the refractory brickwork\nrepair of the oven chamber floor by flooding with cement\ninjection of dust into the fine cracks\ncomplete overhaul of the doors; complete dismantling of all individual parts, cleaning and reassembling; readjustment of the sealing elements. Replacement of damaged door bricks; in many cases a complete rebricking of the door is necessary.\n\nIn addition to this overhaul, the bracing system of the ovens (springs, anchoring, etc.) is regularly checked and adjusted.\n\nOther programmes include, for example:\n\nfrequently cleaning goosenecks and the main collecting passages to prevent obstructions\ncleaning of lids\ndevelopment of a coke oven chamber wall diagnosing-repairing apparatus.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nGood maintenance prevents cracks in the refractory brickwork and minimises leakage and consequently emissions of incompletely combusted raw gas. This prevents black smoke from being visible at the stacks discharging flue-gas from coke oven firing. In addition, the maintenance, readjustment and overhaul of the doors and frames prevents leaks. Well-maintained goosenecks and collecting mains also prevent emissions from charging.\n\nCross-media effects\nNo significant cross-media effects are known.\n\nOperational data\nThe maintenance programme described has been applied in general by all operators (e.g. ArcelorMittal, Ghent, Belgium since 1986), with considerable success. \n\nApplicability\nContinuous or campaign maintenance programmes can be applied both at new and existing plants. \n\nEconomics\nPersonnel costs for skilled workers carrying out the maintenance programme are considerable (about EUR 2/t coke in the case of ArcelorMittal, Ghent, Belgium) but as part of the measures of smooth and undisturbed operation, better skilled operators contribute to higher productivity, thus compensating for costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe intention to operate the coke oven plant as smoothly as possible with optimised productivity and minimised emissions is the driving force for the implementation of this technique.\n\nExample plants\nArcelorMittal coke oven plant in Ghent, Belgium. This is a common technique carried out by all coke operators.\n\nReference literature\n          \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3587975_abstract", "x": 0.73329586, "y": 0.35626635, "title": "SINTERING MACHINE FOR SINTERED ORE", "year": 2020, "text": "Provided is a sintering machine, which makes it possible to effectively prevent gas leakage to secure high safety and also to increase the exhaust gas circulation amount.A sintering machine (50) according to the present invention includes a sinter strand (6) having pallet cars that run on rails on a floor, and is used for producing sintered ore by, while the pallet cars are travelling, continuously burning sinter feed piled on the pallet cars, the machine (50) including: an exhaust duct (2) with a blower (14) for sucking exhaust gas from below the sinter strand (6) and discharging it to the outside; an exhaust gas circulating hood (1) over the pallet cars; an exhaust gas circulating duct (3) connecting between the exhaust duct (2) and the hood (1); and a seal portion hermetically sealing a gap between the hood (1) and the floor, and being configured to keep pressure of the inside of the hood (1) at or below the atmospheric pressure.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"3.3.5.2.1\" title=\"Partial recycling of waste gas from the whole strand\">\n<references_to>3.3.2.4, 3.3.5.2</references_to>\n\n<content>\nPartial recycling of waste gas from the whole strand\n\nDescription\nThe concept of this technique is to recycle a part of the mixed waste gas from the whole strand back to the entire surface of the strand (see Figure   3 .45). The recycling rate of the sintering waste gas is of the order of 40 - 45 %, corresponding to a 14 - 15 % oxygen concentration in the wet gas/air mixture in the hood and resulting in a 45 - 50 % decrease of the waste gas flow emitted to the atmosphere. \n\n\nFigure 3.45:\tCovered sinter strand according to the Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS) process\n\n\nThe waste gas is dedusted in a cyclone before being recycled through an additional fan to the hood above the strand. Under these conditions, the strand productivity remains unchanged and the consumption of coke breeze is reduced by 10 - 15 % compared to conventional practice at Corus IJmuiden, the Netherlands. The sinter quality, defined as reduction disintegration, is constant, the FeO in the sinter increases by 1.5 %, reducibility increases, cold strength decreases slightly and the mean diameter remains approximately 17 mm. The use of the sinter produced in the blast furnace does not show any adverse effects but it should be noted that this sinter only accounts for about 50 % of the charge because of the high percentage of pellets used in blast furnaces at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands. Elsewhere, the level of sinter used in the blast furnace burden can be much higher (up to 95 %).\n\nFigure 3.46:\tSchematic diagram of the emission optimised sintering (Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS)) process\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nPartial recycling of waste gas from the whole strand was primarily developed to reduce waste gas flow and thus the mass emissions of dust and PCDD/F with the benefit that additional abatement equipment to further treat the waste gas before discharge to the atmosphere would have to treat lower volumes, with implied capital and operational cost savings. Prior to the installation of this system at the plant in Netherlands, the end-of-pipe abatement technique used was a cyclone and it was inevitable that additional abatement equipment would also be required (see Section 3.3.2.4). The results from this particular commercial plant for high basicity sinter (>= 1.7 CaO/SiO2) indicate that successful implementation of this technique is possible (see Table   3 .63). The results for sinter with low basicity are similar.\n\nTable 3.63:\tComparison of characteristics and emission values of conventional sintering and emission optimised sintering at a sinter strand at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands\n\n\nThe emission reductions (by mass) resulting from the application of this technique at Corus IJmuiden are given in Table   3 .64.\n\n\nTable 3.64:\tReported emission reduction (by mass) of emission optimised sintering (Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS)) at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands\n\n\nThis technique allows for the consumption of coke breeze to be reduced from 60 kg/t sinter to 48 kg/t sinter. This significant savings in thermal energy in the Dutch plant described above is not necessarily transferable to other plants because they may already be operating at low thermal energy inputs from the solid fuels as a result of the application of process optimisation measures. Data from the European Blast Furnace Committee survey of the operational data for sinter plants (1996), clearly demonstrate that many European plants already operate at significantly lower levels.\n\nThe application of Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS) requires the installation of extra suction fans. This will result in an additionally installed electric capacity of 200 to 400 kW, amounting to an increase in energy consumption by 3 - 8 MJ/t sinter, which is low compared to the overall potential savings.\n\nCross-media effects\nThis technique reduces both emissions to air and the energy consumption of the sintering process. The additional suction fans increase electricity consumption, but this increase is negligible compared to the savings in coke breeze. Special attention need to be paid to carbon monoxide (CO) in the recirculated waste gas in order to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning of employees.\n\nOperational data\nThis technique first came into operation in the EU in May 1994 on sinter strand 31 of the Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands sinter plant. Now, Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS) is being used at all three sinter strands at the plant. To date, availability of the system has been >95 %. In case of failure, the system is automatically switched to conventional sintering.\n\nApplicability\nThis technique can be applied at both new and existing plants although it is recognised that investment costs are lower in the case of new plants incorporating the system from the planning stage, than at some existing plants which may have considerably higher costs due to plant design. In existing plants, it may not be possible to install a partial recycling of waste gas due to space restrictions. The application of waste gas recirculation requires special efforts to ensure that the sinter quality and productivity are not affected negatively (see Section 3.3.5.2).\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required to implement this technique at the sinter plant at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands with a total conventional waste gas flow of approximately 1.2 million Nm3/h from three sinter strands was EUR 17 million. Operational costs were decreased compared to conventional sintering due to a reduced input of coke breeze. Operational savings are estimated at EUR 2.5 million/yr. This figure is based on a reduced consumption of coke breeze by 6 kg/t sinter, at a price of EUR 100/t coke breeze and sinter production of 4.2 Mt/yr. These figures may be exceptional and may not be possible to achieve at many other EU sinter plants, particularly those already operating at significantly lower solid fuel inputs than those quoted for Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands (see above). It should also be stressed that the estimated average price of the coke breeze used at other EU sinter plants is about 40 % cheaper, rendering any possible coke breeze savings less economically attractive.

The recycling rate of the sintering waste gas is of the order of 40 - 45 %, corresponding to a 14 - 15 % oxygen concentration in the wet gas/air mixture in the hood and resulting in a 45 - 50 % decrease of the waste gas flow emitted to the atmosphere. \n\n\nFigure 3.45:\tCovered sinter strand according to the Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS) process\n\n\nThe waste gas is dedusted in a cyclone before being recycled through an additional fan to the hood above the strand. Under these conditions, the strand productivity remains unchanged and the consumption of coke breeze is reduced by 10 - 15 % compared to conventional practice at Corus IJmuiden, the Netherlands. The sinter quality, defined as reduction disintegration, is constant, the FeO in the sinter increases by 1.5 %, reducibility increases, cold strength decreases slightly and the mean diameter remains approximately 17 mm. The use of the sinter produced in the blast furnace does not show any adverse effects but it should be noted that this sinter only accounts for about 50 % of the charge because of the high percentage of pellets used in blast furnaces at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands. Elsewhere, the level of sinter used in the blast furnace burden can be much higher (up to 95 %).\n\nFigure 3.46:\tSchematic diagram of the emission optimised sintering (Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS)) process\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nPartial recycling of waste gas from the whole strand was primarily developed to reduce waste gas flow and thus the mass emissions of dust and PCDD/F with the benefit that additional abatement equipment to further treat the waste gas before discharge to the atmosphere would have to treat lower volumes, with implied capital and operational cost savings. Prior to the installation of this system at the plant in Netherlands, the end-of-pipe abatement technique used was a cyclone and it was inevitable that additional abatement equipment would also be required (see Section 3.3.2.4). The results from this particular commercial plant for high basicity sinter (>= 1.7 CaO/SiO2) indicate that successful implementation of this technique is possible (see Table   3 .63). The results for sinter with low basicity are similar.\n\nTable 3.63:\tComparison of characteristics and emission values of conventional sintering and emission optimised sintering at a sinter strand at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands\n\n\nThe emission reductions (by mass) resulting from the application of this technique at Corus IJmuiden are given in Table   3 .64.\n\n\nTable 3.64:\tReported emission reduction (by mass) of emission optimised sintering (Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS)) at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands\n\n\nThis technique allows for the consumption of coke breeze to be reduced from 60 kg/t sinter to 48 kg/t sinter. This significant savings in thermal energy in the Dutch plant described above is not necessarily transferable to other plants because they may already be operating at low thermal energy inputs from the solid fuels as a result of the application of process optimisation measures. Data from the European Blast Furnace Committee survey of the operational data for sinter plants (1996), clearly demonstrate that many European plants already operate at significantly lower levels.\n\nThe application of Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS) requires the installation of extra suction fans. This will result in an additionally installed electric capacity of 200 to 400 kW, amounting to an increase in energy consumption by 3 - 8 MJ/t sinter, which is low compared to the overall potential savings.\n\nCross-media effects\nThis technique reduces both emissions to air and the energy consumption of the sintering process. The additional suction fans increase electricity consumption, but this increase is negligible compared to the savings in coke breeze. Special attention need to be paid to carbon monoxide (CO) in the recirculated waste gas in order to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning of employees.\n\nOperational data\nThis technique first came into operation in the EU in May 1994 on sinter strand 31 of the Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands sinter plant. Now, Emission Optimised Sintering (EOS) is being used at all three sinter strands at the plant. To date, availability of the system has been >95 %. In case of failure, the system is automatically switched to conventional sintering.\n\nApplicability\nThis technique can be applied at both new and existing plants although it is recognised that investment costs are lower in the case of new plants incorporating the system from the planning stage, than at some existing plants which may have considerably higher costs due to plant design. In existing plants, it may not be possible to install a partial recycling of waste gas due to space restrictions. The application of waste gas recirculation requires special efforts to ensure that the sinter quality and productivity are not affected negatively (see Section 3.3.5.2).\n\nEconomics\nThe investment required to implement this technique at the sinter plant at Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands with a total conventional waste gas flow of approximately 1.2 million Nm3/h from three sinter strands was EUR 17 million. Operational costs were decreased compared to conventional sintering due to a reduced input of coke breeze. Operational savings are estimated at EUR 2.5 million/yr. This figure is based on a reduced consumption of coke breeze by 6 kg/t sinter, at a price of EUR 100/t coke breeze and sinter production of 4.2 Mt/yr.

Every charge of hot metal should be refined until the required steel quality is achieved. In order to monitor progress, samples are taken from the steel bath for analysis. The results of the analysis are used to determine the additional time of oxygen blowing needed to achieve the required steel quality.\n\nThe latest dynamic modelling and monitoring systems reach a precision that makes sampling during blowing unnecessary. A control sample is then taken during the pouring period. This technique eliminates the emissions due to sampling.\n\nIt used to be necessary to interrupt oxygen blowing and tilt the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) in order to take the sample. This was a time-consuming process and it increased emissions from the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF). In a modern plant, samples are taken online during oxygen blowing by means of a sub-lance or a similar device. This enables the refining process to continue while the samples are being analysed. This shortens production cycle times and so increases productivity.

A contaminated process water flow is therefore generated. In many cases, this waste water is treated together with waste water streams from the hot rolling mills. After treatment, the water is recirculated. \n\nThe casting mould and the inner part of the rollers are usually cooled with water in a closed circuit and are not considered here. \n\nThe main pollutants are suspended solids and oil. The main measures to reduce discharges to water are a high rate of recirculation along with sedimentation and/or filtration of the bleed. Skimming tanks can be used to remove oil.\n\nThe spray water is commonly precipitated by sand filtration prior to or after cooling in an evaporative cooling tower. Sand filtration helps to ensure low levels of particulate and oil contamination to achieve satisfactorily prolonged operation of the secondary spray nozzles of the casting machine. The bleed from the open circuit to control the level of dissolved solids should be taken from downstream of the sand filtration plant to minimise the discharge of suspended solids and any oil/grease contamination. To prevent the clogging of the sand filter, oil skimming should be installed before the sand filters.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nIn Table   7 .152 examples are given for specific emissions to water from continuous casting.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.152:\tOverview of specific emissions to water from direct cooling systems at continuous casting\n\n\nExample of the concentration of pollutants in waste water from continuous casting after treatment at the basic oxygen furnace at ArcelorMittal, Bremen, Germany are given in Table   7 .153   \n\n\nTable 7.153:\tExample of the concentration of pollutants in waste water from continuous casting after treatment at the basic oxygen furnace at ArcelorMittal, Bremen, Germany\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe sedimentation steps generate a sludge which contains iron which can be recycled into the sinter plant or by direct injection via tuyeres in the blast furnace.\n\n\n\n\nOperational data\nNo data submitted.\n\nApplicability\nA high recirculation rate and a treatment of the bleed can be applied at both new and existing plants.\n\nEconomics\nNo data submitted.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nNo data submitted.\n\nExample plants\nArcelorMittal, Indiana Harbour Works, Indiana, United States\nCorus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands\nArcelorMittal, Ghent, Belgium\nVoestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria.\n\nReference literature\n    \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3276260_abstract", "x": 0.75188684, "y": 0.3720481, "title": "BURNER, COMBUSTION DEVICE, BOILER, AND BURNER CONTROL METHOD", "year": 2018, "text": "A burner equipped with: an inside gas nozzle extending along an axis line while surrounding that axis line and capable of supplying to a furnace an oxygen-containing gas for inside combustion; a fuel supply nozzle that, when viewed in the direction along the axis line, surrounds the inside gas nozzle, and is capable of supplying to the furnace a fluid mixture of a solid powder fuel and a carrier gas; an outside gas nozzle that, when viewed in the direction along the axis line, surrounds the fuel supply nozzle, and is capable of supplying to the furnace an oxygen-containing gas for outside combustion; and a flow speed ratio adjustment mechanism capable of adjusting the relative flow speed ratio of the spray flow speed of the oxygen-containing gas for inside combustion and the spray flow speed of the oxygen-containing gas for outside combustion.

Previously, most of the chemical energy was dissipated by flaring.\n\nBasic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas produced during oxygen blowing leaves the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) through the converter mouth and is subsequently caught by the primary ventilation. This gas has a temperature of approximately 1200 degC and a flow rate of approximately 50 - 100 Nm3/t steel. The gas contains approximately 70 - 80 % carbon monoxide (CO) when leaving the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) and has a heating value of approximately 8.8 MJ/Nm3.\n\nGenerally, two systems can be used to recover energy from the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas:\n\nCombustion of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas in the converter gas duct and subsequent recovery of the sensible heat in a waste heat boiler to produce steam\n\nThis Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas can be fully or partially combusted by allowing ambient air into the gas duct of the primary ventilation system. Thus, the sensible heat and the total gas flow in the primary ventilation system increases and more steam can be generated in the waste heat boiler. The amount of air admixed with the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas determines the amount of steam generated.\n\nIn a complete steelmaking cycle (approximately 30 - 40 minutes), oxygen blowing lasts for approximately 15 minutes. Steam generation, which is directly related to oxygen blowing, is therefore discontinuous.\n\nSuppression of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas combustion and buffering of the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas in a gasholder for subsequent use \n\nBasic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas combustion in the primary ventilation system can be suppressed by preventing the supply of ambient air from going into the system. This is usually done by lowering a water-cooled retractable skirt over the mouth of the converter. In this way, the carbon monoxide is retained and the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas can be used as an energy source at other locations. The gas is cleaned to meet grid gas requirements and can be buffered in a gasholder. A waste heat boiler may be installed to recover the sensible heat which is present in the non-combusted Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas. It should be noted that Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas is not collected during the start and the end of blowing on account of its low CO content. During these periods, which last a few minutes, it is flared instead (see Figure   7 .115).\n\nThere is a trend toward suppressed combustion followed by Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas recovery. There are two main reasons for this:\n\nsuppressed combustion reduces the quantity of flue-gas and thus reduces the cost of fans and dust removal. The reduced waste gas flow rate typical of suppressed combustion results in a raw gas with a higher mass concentration. Thus for an identical clean gas dust concentration, a more efficient dust recovery system must be used (see also Section 7.3.1)\nlarge volumes of steam are obtained from full combustion systems. However, as the steam is produced discontinuously, it cannot always be fully utilised. The use of recovered Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas with suppressed combustion is much more flexible. The use of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas in conjunction with blast furnace gas and coke oven gas as a third gas phase furnace product brings substantial advantages if it allows for the replacement of considerable amounts of primary energy resources, such as natural gas. At some plants, the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas is primarily used in upgrading the blast furnace gas .

Another 50 - 80 % is recovered as chemical energy (CO) in the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas, depending on the air introduction factor. When the gas is flared and thus not recovered, this energy is lost.\n\nIn total energy recovery when applying suppressed combustion, Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas recovery and a waste heat boiler for the use of sensible heat can be as high as 90 %  .\n\nWhen Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas is recovered, energy savings amount to 0.35 - 0.7 GJ/t LS, compared to flaring.

Twin roll strip casting as a vertical casting technique and direct horizontal strip casting (which used to be called direct strip casting) are the ones with the greatest industrial interest.\n\nAn overview of twin roll and direct horizontal strip casting processes and further techniques is given in  (see Figure   7 .130).\n\n\nFigure 7.130:\tPossible classification scheme for the strip casting processes \n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe achievable benefit for energy savings is essentially based on the fact that reheating is not necessary as well as on the reduced work for hot rolling. In comparison to conventional slab casting, additional energy for reaching the temperature necessary for hot rolling is not needed. Calculations with respect to energy consumption have already been done in the past. The relationship between primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions for the different casting techniques is given in Figure   7 .131  along with the main process steps. A reevaluation of the energy demand for strip casting is part of a running BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) project .\n\n\nFigure 7.131:\tRelationship between primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions (comparison of industrial scale plants) for different casting techniques\n\nCross-media effects\nNo cross-media effects were reported.\n\nOperational data\nData on consumption levels are not available. \n\nApplicability\nThe strip casting technique is applicable both at new and existing steel plants. The relatively small space needed (approximately 100 m in length) offers the potential to integrate a strip caster when retrofitting.\n\nThe casting process can be applied at both types of steel plants, Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) and Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). Further metallurgical techniques are related to the steel grades, but not to the strip casting process. \n\nThe applicability depends also on the produced steel grades (for example: you cannot produce heavy plates with this process) and on the product portfolio (product mix) of the individual steelplant.\n\nEconomics \nThere are three main economic incentives for establishing the strip casting technique: the capital costs, the energy savings and the required area. Additionally, the technique is useful for a wide range of steel grades and the production capacity of a one line casting rolling machine is approximately 1.5 million tonnes/yr.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving forces for the implementation of this technique are multifaceted:\n\nmaterial forces: horizontal strip casting prevents impact due to the bending and straightening of the product. In particular, it is advantageous to produce grades with critical ductility properties at a high temperature by applying this technique. High alloyed steel grades (specifically those with a high Al content) can be produced because no interaction with casting powder occurs\neconomic and environmental forces: the main economic reasons are hot charging of strips without reheating and reduced hot rolling work. Both items lead to decreased emissions.\n\nExample plants \nStrip casters (twin-roll caster) are operational at ThyssenKrupp Nirosta, Bochum, Germany (400 000 t/yr); Nucor Crawfordsville, Indiana, US (400 000 t/yr) and Nippon Steel, Japan. Upcoming projects are at Nucor Castrip Blytheville, Arkansas, US (500 000 t/yr) and Posco Postrip Pohang, Korea (600 000 t/yr) .\n\nThe scheduled start-up for an industrial horizontal strip caster with a capacity of 500 000 t/yr is 2010.\n\nReference literature\n    \n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4115962_abstract", "x": 0.550723, "y": 0.2910811, "title": "HYDROMETALLURGICAL METHOD FOR SIMULTANEOUSLY EXTRACTING METALS AND GYPSUM FROM THE DUST OF A STEELWORKS ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE", "year": 2023, "text": "The present invention relates to a new hydrometallurgical method for simultaneously extracting zinc, lead, silver, iron and calcium from electric arc furnace dust (hazardous waste) produced by the steelmaking industry (steelworks), in the form of industrial products: zinc as zinc sulphate or zinc cathodes; lead and silver as a concentrate of lead and silver; iron as reduced elemental iron for return to the electric arc furnace; and, lastly, calcium as gypsum, without solid waste or liquid effluents being generated.

The air used for the air classification contains large amounts of dust which have to be captured. The characteristics of the dust are such that they can be effectively captured using an ESP. The captured material can be fed directly to the mixing stage as it has the same composition as the raw material (approximately 1.1 wt-% coke breeze, approximately 1.3 wt-% Olivine (FeO, MgO, SiO2) and the rest is a blend of ores, being magnetite (FeO) and hematite (Fe2O3)). \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe ESP operates more or less as an integrated part of the air classification system. Achieved emissions concentrations are <20 mg/Nm3. Modern-design ESPs may achieve lower emissions and hence recover raw materials as well.\n\nCross-media effects\nThe precipitate from the ESP is completely used as raw material in the balling mill.

Sensible heat from the flue-gas can be used to preheat the fuel media. The feasibility of this depends on the efficiency of the stoves as this determines the waste gas temperature (e.g. at waste gas temperatures below 250 degC, heat recovery may not be a technically or economically attractive option). The heat exchanger preferably consists of a heating oil circuit, for economic reasons. In some cases, imported heat may be used, e.g. sinter cooler heat, if the distances are reasonable. A preheated fuel medium reduces energy consumption. At plants that use enriched blast furnace gas, preheating the fuel could mean that enrichment would not longer be necessary\nuse of more suitable burners to improve combustion\nrapid O2 measurement and subsequent adaptation of combustion conditions.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\n reported the following energy savings:\n\nthe use of computer-aided hot stoves leads to an efficiency improvement of the hot stove of more than 5 %. This equals an energy savings of approximately 0.1 GJ/t hot metal. \npreheating of the fuel or combustion air can lead to an energy savings of approximately 0.3 GJ/t hot metal as well. Significant energy savings are reached by using the combustion gas to preheat the blast furnace gas. The savings from this technique are about 170 MJ/t steel. The emission levels that can be achieved are: NOX 20 - 25 g/t hot metal, SO2 70 - 100 g/t hot metal, CO2 0.4 - 0.5 g/t hot metal. \nconcerning techniques No 3 and 4, an additional 0.04 GJ/t hot metal may be saved by improved combustion and adaptation of combustion conditions.\n\nThe total energy savings possible by a combination of techniques is of the order of 0.5 GJ/t hot metal.\n\nCross-media effects\nNo cross-media effects were reported by .

With respect to recycled materials which contain hydrocarbons, especially oil, in Section 3.3.2.5.1 techniques are described to lower the oil/hydrocarbon input. There is another possibility to recycle such materials with a higher oil content by insuring that the oil content in the total mix does not exceed 3 %. It is called 'top layer sintering' and is claimed to be much cheaper compared to de-oiling techniques. Top layer sintering means that a certain mixture of by-products/residues which contain oil/hydrocarbons are conditioned to approximately 7 % water content and then deposited with a feeding drum on the main sinter layer. A second ignition hood with an energy output of 25 to 35 % of the energy output of the main burner is used to ignite this second layer. For achieving a high sinter quality from the second sinter layer of by-products/residues which contain oil, it is important that a balanced selection of energy carriers be present within this layer in order to satisfy the enthalpy requirements for water and oil evaporation, for the cracking of the inherent organic components, as well as for the complete sintering of this layer. In addition to this careful proportion of the sinter feed components, the exact positioning and timing of ignition of the second sintering layer is of critical importance.\n\nAchieved environmental benefit\nThe combustion of hydrocarbons (mainly deriving from the oil content of recycled materials) within the sinter layers is optimised in order to protect the ESP (from fires) and to avoid blue haze (which represents incomplete combusted organic compounds). In addition, the emissions of PCDD/F can be reduced; pot grate tests showed a reduction of 60 - 65 % but data from sinter strands are not available.\n\nCross-media effects\nAdditional fuel for the ignition of the second layer needs to be available.\n\nOperational data\nThe sinter strand of Voestalpine Stahl Donawitz GmbH, Austria has a suction area of 120 m2 and a productivity of 35 t/m2/day. The productivity did not change after the introduction of top layer sintering in January 1995. The capacity for recycling production residues which contain iron is 18 t/h.\nApplicability\nThere is limited applicability to existing plants because of missing space for additional storage facilities and for a second feed system as well.

Those windboxes are selected for waste gas recycling where the burn-through is at or near the bottom of the bed. It was established that the temperature of the recycled gas should be the same as the gas led to the waste gas stack to avoid corrosion problems in resulting gases at temperatures below the acid dew point. At the Voestalpine Stahl sinter plant in Linz, Austria, Windboxes 11 to 16 of the newly extended strand were found to be the most suited for waste gas recycling. This is shown schematically in Figure   3 .48. A second suction fan is installed parallel to the existing process fan to ensure that the suction pressure for sintering can be maintained. This fan is designed to take the waste gases from the selected windboxes and recycle it via an ESP to the recirculation gas hood.\n\n\nFigure 3.48:\tSchematic diagram of the EPOSINT gas recycling technique installed at sinter strand No 5 of Voestalpine, Linz, Austria\nThe area in which the temperature increases may vary along the strand lFength dependent upon the sinter mix and other operational considerations. A feature of this process is the ability to divert the waste gases from the individual windboxes in the range 11 to 16 independently to the stack or to the recirculation hood. This feature gives the process a high degree of flexibility.\n\nTo overcome the problem of oxygen deficiency in the recirculated gases, the hot exhaust gases from the sinter cooler are returned to the system via another fan, a gas mixing chamber and the recirculation hood. Not only does this have the effect of boosting the oxygen level in the recirculation hood to help ensure that sinter quality can be maintained, but it also increases the potential to reduce the coke rate by increasing the gas temperature and decreasing the diffuse particulate emissions from the cooler.\n\nThe hood structure covers the entire width of the strand and is sealed to the pallet sidewalls through a non-contact, narrow gap labyrinth seal preventing the unintentional release of the recirculated gas and dust particles. Since the entire pallet structure is not enclosed, the pallet wheels, etc. are able to operate in a clean atmosphere eliminating wear/failure from dust ingress to the bearings. The seal provides security against the escape of the recirculated gas which contains CO and special measures are in place to prevent escapes due to plant or instrument failures. The hood structure does not extend across the whole length of the strand (see Figure   3 .48), allowing cold air to be drawn through the sinter bed in the last few windboxes. This helps to ensure that the sinter is adequately cooled on the strand prior to the cooler and facilitates the ease of removal of pallets as necessary from time to time for maintenance purposes.\n\nSome characteristics of the EPOSINT application include the following:\n\nthe recirculation of a part of the waste gas is selective from the field of rising temperature, where all relevant emissions are higher than the average values\nthe recirculation leads to a reduction in coke breeze consumption and waste gas volume\nthe gas recycling hood covers the sinter strand width\nthe gas recycling hood does not cover the whole suction area\ndue to the low O2 concentration in the recirculated waste gas, in combination with a high efficient sealing system of the hood to minimise false air, additional air from the sinter cooler is used. To ensure that there are no negative effects on sinter production and sinter quality, the minimum O2 concentration in the recirculated gas (i.e. process combustion air) is 13 %.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nSome environmental advantages of this technique are a decrease in energy consumption, up to 40 % reduction in off-gas volume and a decrease in coke consumption. Recirculation of sinter waste gas (also used in the case of the techniques described in Sections 3.3.5.2.1 and 3.3.5.2.4) reduces the emissions of NOX and PCDD/F due to their decomposition in the sinter bed. SOX is also absorbed or filtered by the sinter layer and the CO is used as fuel. With this gas recirculation technique, not only is a significant reduction of waste gas volume achieved, but particulate and gaseous emissions reductions are also achieved and the abatement of diffuse dust emissions of the sinter cooler is also realised. Table   3 .66 shows the benefit from the application of the selective waste gas recirculation technique in percentages for certain parameters.\n\nTable 3.66:\tMain environmental benefits of the application of the sectional waste gas recirculation technique\n\n\nTable   3 .67 gives some operational data for the emissions concentrations and emissions factors before and after the application of the sectional waste gas recirculation technique for one plant in Austria.\n\n\nTable 3.67:\tOperational data of the sinter plant before and after installation of sectional waste gas recirculation (2007, applying Airfine for waste gas abatement)\n\n\nCross-media effects\nThe additional electrical energy due to the additional fan is recouped through higher production and a decrease in the solid fuel requirement of 2 - 5 kg coke/t sinter. Special attention should be paid to carbon monoxide (CO) in the recirculated waste gas in order to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning of employees.\nOperational data\nSinter strand No 5 of Voestalpine Stahl in Linz, Austria has operated with this technique since April 2005. The quality parameters for the sinter remained the same as before the installation of the technique. The reduction in coke breeze consumption is reported at 2 - 5 kg/t sinter (45 kg/t sinter to 40 kg/t sinter). There have been no reported problems associated specifically with the process. Some operational advantages of this technique are an increased sinter production per Nm3 off-gas and stable sinter quality and the capacity of existing sinter plants to be increased by approximately 40 % (e.g. by lengthening the sinter machine) without any increase in the sinter off-gas volume.\n\nApplicability\nWaste gas recirculation with this technique can be implemented in new and existing sinter plants. In existing plants, it may not be possible to install a partial recycling of waste gas due to space restrictions. In the Linz plant, it was possible to design the system so as to retain the existing waste gas system (i.e. collecting main, gas cleaning system, main fan and stack) that remained unmodified. The application of waste gas recirculation requires special efforts to ensure that the sinter quality and productivity are not affected negatively (see Section 3.3.5.2).\n\nEconomics\nInvestment costs for a suction area of 250 m2 are about EUR 15 million. At the plant cited, the installation was particularly economic because no modifications had to be made to the existing waste gas system. A reduction in operating costs results from a decrease in fuel consumption of about 2 - 5 kg coke/t sinter and a minimisation of costs for waste gas cleaning due to a smaller gas volume, especially when using expensive gas cleaning systems such as fine wet scrubbers or bag filters with the addition of adsorbing agents.\n\nThe application of this technique lowers the investment and operational costs for modern waste gas cleaning facilities.\n\nIn 2007 the cost of a selective gas recirculation system for the ArcelorMittal, Ghent, Belgium sinter plants was estimated in 2007 at EUR 14 million for sinter plant 1 (175 m2) and EUR 27.3 million for sinter plant 2 (498 m2).\n\nDriving force for implementation\nNo data submitted.\n\nExample plants\nThis technique has been in operation since May 2005 at Voestalpine in Linz, Austria on sinter strand No 5 and has been upgraded from 56 to 74 m.\n\nReference literature\n   \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3031507_abstract", "x": 0.68874395, "y": 0.38531175, "title": "STATIONARY FILTER BAGS REGENERATION UNIT WITH INDIVIDUAL UNDER-PRESSURE TURN-OFF", "year": 2016, "text": "Horizontal bag filter applies to separators for filtration of solid particles from gases, which use filter bag preferably made of flexible material.The horizontal bag filter, which consists of a housing divided by a perforated wall on a polluted gas chamber and a cleaned gas chamber.

Usually, the removal of dust is combined with the removal of acidic waste gas compounds such as HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and SOX by injection of slaked lime or sodium bicarbonate solutions and the removal of persistent organic pollutants such as PCDD/F, PCB, HCB or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) by injection of adsorbents (mainly powdered lignite coke or activated carbon, and/or sometimes zeolites) (see Figure   3 .39). All the dust, the carbon/coke and unreacted desulphurisation reagents as well as the reaction products (gypsum and sodium sulphate) are filtered off by means of the bag filter. A significant proportion of the removed dust is recirculated to the waste gas in order to increase the adsorption efficiency and thus reduce the costs for consumables. The rest is discharged out of the system for disposal. In some cases, the discharged dust and additives are returned to the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front. When combined desulphurisation is applied, the solid residues from the bag filter are usually not recycled to the sinter strand due to the release of the SO2.\nThe several steps of this combination of techniques are as follows:\n\ninjection of adsorbents (powdered lignite coke or active carbon and/or zeolites) upstream of the bag filter in the flue-gas duct to reduce the emissions of hazardous compounds\ninjection of sodium bicarbonate or slaked lime into the flue-gas duct to reduce acidic emissions (e.g. SOX, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) combined with an adequate conditioning of the waste gas by moisturisation and temperature adjustment (90 - 100 degC) \ndust capture in a chemical-resistant bag filter with an automatic dust removal system (e.g. pulse-jet type)\nrecycling of dust back to the flue-gas upstream of the bag filter. In some cases, a large amount of particulates is recirculated\nextraction of flue-gases from the system with a fan.\n\nThe injection of alkaline compounds, usually lime, also help to prevent the blinding of the filter material by fine particulates or organic compounds and to avoid corrosion. The lime builds up a layer on the surface of the bag (precoating the bag) preventing the formation of an impermeable layer and consequently blinding the filter material.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, more details on the techniques are provided.\n\nFor the treatment of the acidic compounds in the waste gas from sinter strands, usually a 'semi-dry sorption process' is used. This means that additional water is applied in order to cool the off-gas temperature to 90 - 100 degC for an efficient desulphurisation and also to avoid potential damage to the downstream fabric filter bags. The water can be sprayed directly into the waste gas flow. \n\nIn bag filter systems with dust recirculation (see Figure   3 .39) there is generally a mixer for the recirculated dusts and any fresh additives (slaked lime and/or carbon). To facilitate desulphurisation of the waste gas, moisture is added to the dust in the mixer. The amount of water added is dependent upon the waste gas temperature and this can affect the degree of desulphurisation achieved. The desulphurisation rate is determined by the amount of lime added, by the rate of recirculation of the collected dusts, and by the moisture content of the recirculated dust. Desulphurisation also depends on the quality of hydrated lime.\n\nUsually the filter is divided into several filter lines of similar design, each of which is further subdivided into several chambers. The prededusted waste gas stream is distributed uniformly to the top of each of the filter lines and is sucked to the bottom of each chamber. Within the chamber, the waste gas enters from the outside of the filter tube and dust is collected on the fabric as the gas passes through the bag. The bags are supported by cages and can be mounted vertically (longer bags) or horizontally (shorter bags). During waste gas cleaning, a filter cake builds up on the exterior surface of the bag resulting in an increase in the pressure drop across the bag. Once the pressure drop reaches a set point (usual differential pressure between the filter and the clean gas chamber of 10 to 20 mbar) the chamber is taken off-line for cleaning by a reverse pulse of compressed air. The dust removed is collected in conical bins below the filter chambers and discharged by screw conveyors. About 98 % of this dust may be recycled back to the waste gas stream as an additive; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal or optionally sent back to the sinter strand.\n\nAn example of the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter is the MEROS(r) process (Maximised Emission Reduction of Sintering). The full size installation has been in operation on a sinter machine of 222 m2 at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria since August 2007 and replaced the AIRFINE system.\n\nOther examples for the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter are the TFA process (Treatment des Fumes d'Agglomeration) at ArcelorMittal, Fos sur Mer, France or the EFA sintering technology which is applied at Rogesa, Dillingen, Germany. Whereas the TFA process at Fos sur Mer has been in operation since 2006, the EFA process at the sinter plant No 2 in Dillingen is in the trial operation phase.\n\nFigure   3 .39 shows a basic flow sheet of a bag filter applied downstream of an ESP or a cyclone.\n\n\nFigure 3.39:\tBasic flow sheet of a bag filter downstream of an existing ESP or cyclone\n\n\nFigure   3 .40 shows a typical flow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.40:\tFlow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added\n\n\nAlthough this technique is different in process layout, the processes mentioned above have in common that the conventional use of additives like activated carbon or activated lignite coke for heavy metals and PCDD/F removal is accompanied by dust recycling and SOX abatement in case of additional lime and water injection .\n\nThe abated dust consists of primary dust, carbon/coke and non-reacted deSOX reagents. To reduce additive costs, most of the dust separated in the bag filter is recycled to the gas stream allowing these non-reacted additives to come once again into contact with the off-gas and thereby decreasing the costs of the additives.\n\nAnother advantage is that the highly recirculated dust concentration (between 1 and up to 1000 g/Nm3 depending on the technique) leads to a rapid collection of dust on the bag filter, which promotes the further removal of heavy metals and PCDD/F. SOX is reduced by hydrated lime for all mentioned techniques, although sodium bicarbonate can also be applied.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA bag filter is highly efficient at reducing dust and simultaneous heavy metals emissions in a waste gas stream. Bag filters enhanced with additives also reduce the emissions of PCDD/F, hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) and to a lesser extent, sulphur dioxide (SO2). In particular, emissions of PCDD/F may be reduced significantly. A significant removal of VOCs and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) is also reported.\n\nOperational data for European sinter plants using bag filters are usually in the range of 1 to 10 mg/Nm3 particulates expressed on a daily average basis that includes peak periods. The non-volatile heavy metals are reduced simultaneously with the dust. \n\nThe addition of lime and carbon enables the reduction of dioxin emissions to <0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3. \n\nVolatile heavy metals and VOCs are reduced simultaneously by the application of additives and zeolites which contain carbon. For example, mercury is reduced by 80 - 95 %. \n\nSO2 can be reduced by approximately 30 - 80 % with slaked lime and up to 90 % with sodium bicarbonate. This leads to SO2 emissions of between 100 and 500 mg/Nm3 depending on the amount of lime or sodium bicarbonate that is injected. Depending on the SO2 input in practice, daily averages for SOX of lower than 350 mg/Nm3 have been achieved. \n\nWith lime addition, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions concentrations of 0.2 - 1 mg/Nm3 and HCl emissions concentrations of 1 - 10 mg/Nm3 (daily average) can be achieved.\n\nThe achieved environmental levels reported for clean gas from bag filter systems are given in Table   3 .47.\n\n\nTable 3.47:\tPerformance of three sinter strand plants with bag filter systems\n\n\nTable   3 .48 shows examples of achieved emission concentration values for sinter strand emissions after dedusting with a combination of an ESP and a bag filter including statistical information and the corresponding reference time periods.\n\nTable 3.48:\tAchieved emission concentration values for sinter strand dedusting in five EU sinter plants\n\n\nFigure   3 .41 shows the daily average values for dust from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique for over 23 months (January 2008 to October 2009).\n\n\nFigure 3.41:\tDaily means for the dust emissions from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique from January 2008 to October 2009 \n\nApplying bag filters facilitates increasing the recycling of dioxin and heavy metal-containing residues. In one example the amount of recycled dust from the blast furnace gas has been increased from 6 000 tonnes to 39 000 tonnes per year .\n\nCross-media effects\nBag filters generate a solid process residue flow (0.5 to 1 kg/t sinter), which is preferably recycled into the sintering process. In some cases, the captured dust contains unwanted compounds (e.g. zinc, lead, alkalis), hampering its reuse. In this case, some or the entire solid process residues should be discarded as waste for further treatment or disposal.\n\nAt the sinter plant of ArcelorMittal Bremen in Germany that operates without desulphurisation, the separated dust and additives from the bag filter are fully returned to the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front. The separated dust at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Donawitz, Austria must be disposed of because it contains significant amounts of sulphur, chloride, fluoride and alkalis. The dust separated in the ESP (only used as a prededusting device) is recycled or disposed of depending on the alkali chloride content, which can increase the residual dust content in the treated waste gas when returned to the sinter strand.\n\nThe use of a bag filter requires the installation of new booster fans. The additional electricity energy demand including fans, heating devices, motors and auxiliary installations is approximately 1.5 kWh/1000 Nm3/h compared to 1.0 kWh/1000 Nm3/h with an ESP only. \n\nOperational data\nThe recirculation of particulates inside the system to build up a precoating layer at the surface of the bags is used to improve the dedusting efficiency and to increase the lifetime of bags.\n\nDurable bag filter material is an important aspect of this technique. Different types of filter fabric material with specific qualities can be used to achieve a balance between abatement efficiency, lifetime and costs (see Table   3 .52). \n\nThe use of activated carbon or lignite coke differs in grain size and in the effective adsorption surface area and consequently the amount of injection required. Activated coal has the highest specific free surface and shows a very good adsorptive effect. Activated lignite coke is the more economic alternative to activated coke and the super-milled lignite coke with diameters of 0.024 mm also shows a very good adsorptive efficiency and leads to half the dosing rates necessary compared to the application of standard lignite coke . Sometime inerts have to be added to the injected carbon-based materials to prevent ignition. Table   3 .49 shows the characteristics of different adsorbents and absorbent materials.\n\n\nTable 3.49:\tCharacteristics of different adsorbent and absorption materials\n\n\nTo achieve effective adsorption of the PCDD/F, it is necessary to ensure that the carbon additive is distributed rapidly across the duct section. After injection, the absorption and adsorption process starts in the ducts and continues in the filter cake. The carbon additives together with the dust are captured in the bag filter and are removed from the filter in the usual way. A significant proportion of the dust and additives is returned to the waste gas stream; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal. In some cases, the discharged dust and additives are fully returned into the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front.\n\nTable   3 .50 shows a comparison between the use of sodium bicarbonate and slaked lime. \n\n\nTable 3.50:\tTypical operational values when using sodium bicarbonate and slaked lime as additives\n\n\nBy injection of water, the temperature of the waste gas is reduced and the abatement efficiency of acid pollutants is increased. Modern bag filter techniques have systems which decrease the flue-gas temperature to 120 degC or even down to 80 degC either directly or by spraying water into the reactor chamber or indirectly by conditioning the recirculated particles with water. Freshly ground sodium bicarbonate is injected into the flue-gas duct at a temperature above 140 degC. The use of slaked lime needs more energy to reheat the gas.\n\nThere is flexibility with the use of additives (e.g. slaked lime, lignite coke, sodium bicarbonate) depending on the environmental needs. Sodium bicarbonate is used when higher desulphurisation or a deNOX system is required. Additives are stored in silos and sodium bicarbonate is milled before injection.\n\nIn order to enhance the gas cleaning efficiency and to significantly reduce additive costs, most of the separated dust in the bag filter is recycled to the off-gas stream after the conditioning reactor. Unreacted adsorbents once again come into contact with the off-gas, thus increasing the adsorbent efficiency and reducing the costs of consumables. The reaction products and the dust are usually deposited underground due to their fine grain sizes. \n\nIf carbon is used to achieve further reductions of PCDD/F emissions, then special attention has to be paid to the risk of filter fire. Spark detection equipment may be installed and when necessary, the filter is bypassed. Filters usually get bypassed during the start/shut down of the sinter strand. \n\nBag filters are divided into lines and subdivided into different chambers. When a bag filter element is broken, only the corresponding chamber has to be shut down in order to replace this filter element. \n\nApplicability\nThe bag filter can be regarded as an end-of-pipe technique which can be applied at both new and existing plants. For existing plants requirements such as space for a downstream installation to the ESP can be relevant. Special regard should be given to the age and the performance of the existing ESP.\n\nEconomics\nWhen estimating the costs of bag filter with a flow-injection unit, it should be borne in mind that these installations are not only used for dust separation but also for reducing PCDD/F, heavy metals and acid gases such as Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), HCl and SO2. The investment is in the range of EUR 16 to 35/Nm3/h (for new and existing plants).\n\nDecisive cost factors are pressure drop, the waste gas flow, fabric material and filter loading. The operating cost is around EUR 0.3 - 0.6/t sinter and mostly depends on the costs of supplying activated carbon and limestone, and the extra energy. Examples of costs are shown in Table   3 .51.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSinter plants are the major source for dust and dioxin/furan emissions from integrated steelworks. The driving force for implementation is to meet the prescribed emission limit values for dust, heavy metals and PCDD/F, to lower national emissions to meet the national reduction goals according to national and international regulations, environmental reputation and in the case of the plant at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria improved economics compared to the AIRFINE system.\n\nAccording to the Basel Convention and the corresponding Regulation (EC) 850/2004 regarding the treatment of POP-containing waste materials, amended by Regulation (EC) 304/09/EC, transboundary shipments of wastes like iron-bearing filter dust or sludges for recycling purposes are only permissible if the receiving facility complies with an ELV for PCDD/F of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m3. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.51:\tExamples of the cost of bag filters installed in sinter plants\n\n\nSinter off-gas cleaning system EFA at sinter plant No 2 in Dilingen is still in the trial operation phase\n\nExample plants\nBag filters have been applied to the sinter process for the dedusting of waste gas since the beginning of the 1990s.

A sinter off-gas cleaning system with a capacity of 600 000 Nm3/h with bag filter downstream to an ESP has been in trial operation since 2009. The system also injects hydrated lime and activated lignite coke before the bag filter. For the second sinter strand, another plant has been commissioned for a capacity of 900 000 Nm3/h.\n\nIn the US, at least three sinter plants treat the off-gases from sinter strands in bag filters:\n\nInland Steel, East Chicago, US.\nWarren Consolidated Industries (Warren Consolidated Industries (WCI)), Youngstown Sinter Company, Warren, Ohio, US.\nUS Steel, Gary Works, Gary, Indiana, US.\n\nFor the following three sinter plants, the installation of bag filters is scheduled or commissioned:\n\nThyssen Krupp Stahl, Duisburg, Germany announced to retrofit all three sinter plants with bag filters after the existing ESPs by 2011\nSalzgitter AG, Salzgitter, Germany.

Usually, the removal of dust is combined with the removal of acidic waste gas compounds such as HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and SOX by injection of slaked lime or sodium bicarbonate solutions and the removal of persistent organic pollutants such as PCDD/F, PCB, HCB or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) by injection of adsorbents (mainly powdered lignite coke or activated carbon, and/or sometimes zeolites) (see Figure   3 .39). All the dust, the carbon/coke and unreacted desulphurisation reagents as well as the reaction products (gypsum and sodium sulphate) are filtered off by means of the bag filter. A significant proportion of the removed dust is recirculated to the waste gas in order to increase the adsorption efficiency and thus reduce the costs for consumables. The rest is discharged out of the system for disposal. In some cases, the discharged dust and additives are returned to the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front. When combined desulphurisation is applied, the solid residues from the bag filter are usually not recycled to the sinter strand due to the release of the SO2.\nThe several steps of this combination of techniques are as follows:\n\ninjection of adsorbents (powdered lignite coke or active carbon and/or zeolites) upstream of the bag filter in the flue-gas duct to reduce the emissions of hazardous compounds\ninjection of sodium bicarbonate or slaked lime into the flue-gas duct to reduce acidic emissions (e.g. SOX, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) combined with an adequate conditioning of the waste gas by moisturisation and temperature adjustment (90 - 100 degC) \ndust capture in a chemical-resistant bag filter with an automatic dust removal system (e.g. pulse-jet type)\nrecycling of dust back to the flue-gas upstream of the bag filter. In some cases, a large amount of particulates is recirculated\nextraction of flue-gases from the system with a fan.\n\nThe injection of alkaline compounds, usually lime, also help to prevent the blinding of the filter material by fine particulates or organic compounds and to avoid corrosion. The lime builds up a layer on the surface of the bag (precoating the bag) preventing the formation of an impermeable layer and consequently blinding the filter material.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, more details on the techniques are provided.\n\nFor the treatment of the acidic compounds in the waste gas from sinter strands, usually a 'semi-dry sorption process' is used. This means that additional water is applied in order to cool the off-gas temperature to 90 - 100 degC for an efficient desulphurisation and also to avoid potential damage to the downstream fabric filter bags. The water can be sprayed directly into the waste gas flow. \n\nIn bag filter systems with dust recirculation (see Figure   3 .39) there is generally a mixer for the recirculated dusts and any fresh additives (slaked lime and/or carbon). To facilitate desulphurisation of the waste gas, moisture is added to the dust in the mixer. The amount of water added is dependent upon the waste gas temperature and this can affect the degree of desulphurisation achieved. The desulphurisation rate is determined by the amount of lime added, by the rate of recirculation of the collected dusts, and by the moisture content of the recirculated dust. Desulphurisation also depends on the quality of hydrated lime.\n\nUsually the filter is divided into several filter lines of similar design, each of which is further subdivided into several chambers. The prededusted waste gas stream is distributed uniformly to the top of each of the filter lines and is sucked to the bottom of each chamber. Within the chamber, the waste gas enters from the outside of the filter tube and dust is collected on the fabric as the gas passes through the bag. The bags are supported by cages and can be mounted vertically (longer bags) or horizontally (shorter bags). During waste gas cleaning, a filter cake builds up on the exterior surface of the bag resulting in an increase in the pressure drop across the bag. Once the pressure drop reaches a set point (usual differential pressure between the filter and the clean gas chamber of 10 to 20 mbar) the chamber is taken off-line for cleaning by a reverse pulse of compressed air. The dust removed is collected in conical bins below the filter chambers and discharged by screw conveyors. About 98 % of this dust may be recycled back to the waste gas stream as an additive; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal or optionally sent back to the sinter strand.\n\nAn example of the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter is the MEROS(r) process (Maximised Emission Reduction of Sintering). The full size installation has been in operation on a sinter machine of 222 m2 at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria since August 2007 and replaced the AIRFINE system.\n\nOther examples for the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter are the TFA process (Treatment des Fumes d'Agglomeration) at ArcelorMittal, Fos sur Mer, France or the EFA sintering technology which is applied at Rogesa, Dillingen, Germany. Whereas the TFA process at Fos sur Mer has been in operation since 2006, the EFA process at the sinter plant No 2 in Dillingen is in the trial operation phase.\n\nFigure   3 .39 shows a basic flow sheet of a bag filter applied downstream of an ESP or a cyclone.\n\n\nFigure 3.39:\tBasic flow sheet of a bag filter downstream of an existing ESP or cyclone\n\n\nFigure   3 .40 shows a typical flow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.40:\tFlow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added\n\n\nAlthough this technique is different in process layout, the processes mentioned above have in common that the conventional use of additives like activated carbon or activated lignite coke for heavy metals and PCDD/F removal is accompanied by dust recycling and SOX abatement in case of additional lime and water injection .\n\nThe abated dust consists of primary dust, carbon/coke and non-reacted deSOX reagents. To reduce additive costs, most of the dust separated in the bag filter is recycled to the gas stream allowing these non-reacted additives to come once again into contact with the off-gas and thereby decreasing the costs of the additives.\n\nAnother advantage is that the highly recirculated dust concentration (between 1 and up to 1000 g/Nm3 depending on the technique) leads to a rapid collection of dust on the bag filter, which promotes the further removal of heavy metals and PCDD/F. SOX is reduced by hydrated lime for all mentioned techniques, although sodium bicarbonate can also be applied.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA bag filter is highly efficient at reducing dust and simultaneous heavy metals emissions in a waste gas stream. Bag filters enhanced with additives also reduce the emissions of PCDD/F, hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) and to a lesser extent, sulphur dioxide (SO2). In particular, emissions of PCDD/F may be reduced significantly. A significant removal of VOCs and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) is also reported.\n\nOperational data for European sinter plants using bag filters are usually in the range of 1 to 10 mg/Nm3 particulates expressed on a daily average basis that includes peak periods. The non-volatile heavy metals are reduced simultaneously with the dust. \n\nThe addition of lime and carbon enables the reduction of dioxin emissions to <0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3. \n\nVolatile heavy metals and VOCs are reduced simultaneously by the application of additives and zeolites which contain carbon. For example, mercury is reduced by 80 - 95 %. \n\nSO2 can be reduced by approximately 30 - 80 % with slaked lime and up to 90 % with sodium bicarbonate. This leads to SO2 emissions of between 100 and 500 mg/Nm3 depending on the amount of lime or sodium bicarbonate that is injected. Depending on the SO2 input in practice, daily averages for SOX of lower than 350 mg/Nm3 have been achieved. \n\nWith lime addition, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions concentrations of 0.2 - 1 mg/Nm3 and HCl emissions concentrations of 1 - 10 mg/Nm3 (daily average) can be achieved.\n\nThe achieved environmental levels reported for clean gas from bag filter systems are given in Table   3 .47.\n\n\nTable 3.47:\tPerformance of three sinter strand plants with bag filter systems\n\n\nTable   3 .48 shows examples of achieved emission concentration values for sinter strand emissions after dedusting with a combination of an ESP and a bag filter including statistical information and the corresponding reference time periods.\n\nTable 3.48:\tAchieved emission concentration values for sinter strand dedusting in five EU sinter plants\n\n\nFigure   3 .41 shows the daily average values for dust from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique for over 23 months (January 2008 to October 2009).\n\n\nFigure 3.41:\tDaily means for the dust emissions from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique from January 2008 to October 2009 \n\nApplying bag filters facilitates increasing the recycling of dioxin and heavy metal-containing residues. In one example the amount of recycled dust from the blast furnace gas has been increased from 6 000 tonnes to 39 000 tonnes per year .\n\nCross-media effects\nBag filters generate a solid process residue flow (0.5 to 1 kg/t sinter), which is preferably recycled into the sintering process. In some cases, the captured dust contains unwanted compounds (e.g. zinc, lead, alkalis), hampering its reuse. In this case, some or the entire solid process residues should be discarded as waste for further treatment or disposal.\n\nAt the sinter plant of ArcelorMittal Bremen in Germany that operates without desulphurisation, the separated dust and additives from the bag filter are fully returned to the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front. The separated dust at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Donawitz, Austria must be disposed of because it contains significant amounts of sulphur, chloride, fluoride and alkalis. The dust separated in the ESP (only used as a prededusting device) is recycled or disposed of depending on the alkali chloride content, which can increase the residual dust content in the treated waste gas when returned to the sinter strand.\n\nThe use of a bag filter requires the installation of new booster fans. The additional electricity energy demand including fans, heating devices, motors and auxiliary installations is approximately 1.5 kWh/1000 Nm3/h compared to 1.0 kWh/1000 Nm3/h with an ESP only. \n\nOperational data\nThe recirculation of particulates inside the system to build up a precoating layer at the surface of the bags is used to improve the dedusting efficiency and to increase the lifetime of bags.\n\nDurable bag filter material is an important aspect of this technique. Different types of filter fabric material with specific qualities can be used to achieve a balance between abatement efficiency, lifetime and costs (see Table   3 .52). \n\nThe use of activated carbon or lignite coke differs in grain size and in the effective adsorption surface area and consequently the amount of injection required. Activated coal has the highest specific free surface and shows a very good adsorptive effect. Activated lignite coke is the more economic alternative to activated coke and the super-milled lignite coke with diameters of 0.024 mm also shows a very good adsorptive efficiency and leads to half the dosing rates necessary compared to the application of standard lignite coke . Sometime inerts have to be added to the injected carbon-based materials to prevent ignition. Table   3 .49 shows the characteristics of different adsorbents and absorbent materials.\n\n\nTable 3.49:\tCharacteristics of different adsorbent and absorption materials\n\n\nTo achieve effective adsorption of the PCDD/F, it is necessary to ensure that the carbon additive is distributed rapidly across the duct section. After injection, the absorption and adsorption process starts in the ducts and continues in the filter cake. The carbon additives together with the dust are captured in the bag filter and are removed from the filter in the usual way. A significant proportion of the dust and additives is returned to the waste gas stream; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal. In some cases, the discharged dust and additives are fully returned into the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front.\n\nTable   3 .50 shows a comparison between the use of sodium bicarbonate and slaked lime. \n\n\nTable 3.50:\tTypical operational values when using sodium bicarbonate and slaked lime as additives\n\n\nBy injection of water, the temperature of the waste gas is reduced and the abatement efficiency of acid pollutants is increased. Modern bag filter techniques have systems which decrease the flue-gas temperature to 120 degC or even down to 80 degC either directly or by spraying water into the reactor chamber or indirectly by conditioning the recirculated particles with water. Freshly ground sodium bicarbonate is injected into the flue-gas duct at a temperature above 140 degC. The use of slaked lime needs more energy to reheat the gas.\n\nThere is flexibility with the use of additives (e.g. slaked lime, lignite coke, sodium bicarbonate) depending on the environmental needs. Sodium bicarbonate is used when higher desulphurisation or a deNOX system is required. Additives are stored in silos and sodium bicarbonate is milled before injection.\n\nIn order to enhance the gas cleaning efficiency and to significantly reduce additive costs, most of the separated dust in the bag filter is recycled to the off-gas stream after the conditioning reactor. Unreacted adsorbents once again come into contact with the off-gas, thus increasing the adsorbent efficiency and reducing the costs of consumables. The reaction products and the dust are usually deposited underground due to their fine grain sizes. \n\nIf carbon is used to achieve further reductions of PCDD/F emissions, then special attention has to be paid to the risk of filter fire. Spark detection equipment may be installed and when necessary, the filter is bypassed. Filters usually get bypassed during the start/shut down of the sinter strand. \n\nBag filters are divided into lines and subdivided into different chambers. When a bag filter element is broken, only the corresponding chamber has to be shut down in order to replace this filter element. \n\nApplicability\nThe bag filter can be regarded as an end-of-pipe technique which can be applied at both new and existing plants. For existing plants requirements such as space for a downstream installation to the ESP can be relevant. Special regard should be given to the age and the performance of the existing ESP.\n\nEconomics\nWhen estimating the costs of bag filter with a flow-injection unit, it should be borne in mind that these installations are not only used for dust separation but also for reducing PCDD/F, heavy metals and acid gases such as Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), HCl and SO2. The investment is in the range of EUR 16 to 35/Nm3/h (for new and existing plants).\n\nDecisive cost factors are pressure drop, the waste gas flow, fabric material and filter loading. The operating cost is around EUR 0.3 - 0.6/t sinter and mostly depends on the costs of supplying activated carbon and limestone, and the extra energy. Examples of costs are shown in Table   3 .51.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSinter plants are the major source for dust and dioxin/furan emissions from integrated steelworks. The driving force for implementation is to meet the prescribed emission limit values for dust, heavy metals and PCDD/F, to lower national emissions to meet the national reduction goals according to national and international regulations, environmental reputation and in the case of the plant at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria improved economics compared to the AIRFINE system.\n\nAccording to the Basel Convention and the corresponding Regulation (EC) 850/2004 regarding the treatment of POP-containing waste materials, amended by Regulation (EC) 304/09/EC, transboundary shipments of wastes like iron-bearing filter dust or sludges for recycling purposes are only permissible if the receiving facility complies with an ELV for PCDD/F of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m3. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.51:\tExamples of the cost of bag filters installed in sinter plants\n\n\nSinter off-gas cleaning system EFA at sinter plant No 2 in Dilingen is still in the trial operation phase\n\nExample plants\nBag filters have been applied to the sinter process for the dedusting of waste gas since the beginning of the 1990s.

About 98 % of this dust may be recycled back to the waste gas stream as an additive; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal or optionally sent back to the sinter strand.\n\nAn example of the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter is the MEROS(r) process (Maximised Emission Reduction of Sintering). The full size installation has been in operation on a sinter machine of 222 m2 at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria since August 2007 and replaced the AIRFINE system.\n\nOther examples for the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter are the TFA process (Treatment des Fumes d'Agglomeration) at ArcelorMittal, Fos sur Mer, France or the EFA sintering technology which is applied at Rogesa, Dillingen, Germany. Whereas the TFA process at Fos sur Mer has been in operation since 2006, the EFA process at the sinter plant No 2 in Dillingen is in the trial operation phase.\n\nFigure   3 .39 shows a basic flow sheet of a bag filter applied downstream of an ESP or a cyclone.\n\n\nFigure 3.39:\tBasic flow sheet of a bag filter downstream of an existing ESP or cyclone\n\n\nFigure   3 .40 shows a typical flow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.40:\tFlow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added\n\n\nAlthough this technique is different in process layout, the processes mentioned above have in common that the conventional use of additives like activated carbon or activated lignite coke for heavy metals and PCDD/F removal is accompanied by dust recycling and SOX abatement in case of additional lime and water injection .\n\nThe abated dust consists of primary dust, carbon/coke and non-reacted deSOX reagents. To reduce additive costs, most of the dust separated in the bag filter is recycled to the gas stream allowing these non-reacted additives to come once again into contact with the off-gas and thereby decreasing the costs of the additives.\n\nAnother advantage is that the highly recirculated dust concentration (between 1 and up to 1000 g/Nm3 depending on the technique) leads to a rapid collection of dust on the bag filter, which promotes the further removal of heavy metals and PCDD/F. SOX is reduced by hydrated lime for all mentioned techniques, although sodium bicarbonate can also be applied.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nA bag filter is highly efficient at reducing dust and simultaneous heavy metals emissions in a waste gas stream. Bag filters enhanced with additives also reduce the emissions of PCDD/F, hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrofluoric acid (Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) and to a lesser extent, sulphur dioxide (SO2). In particular, emissions of PCDD/F may be reduced significantly. A significant removal of VOCs and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) is also reported.\n\nOperational data for European sinter plants using bag filters are usually in the range of 1 to 10 mg/Nm3 particulates expressed on a daily average basis that includes peak periods. The non-volatile heavy metals are reduced simultaneously with the dust. \n\nThe addition of lime and carbon enables the reduction of dioxin emissions to <0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3. \n\nVolatile heavy metals and VOCs are reduced simultaneously by the application of additives and zeolites which contain carbon. For example, mercury is reduced by 80 - 95 %. \n\nSO2 can be reduced by approximately 30 - 80 % with slaked lime and up to 90 % with sodium bicarbonate. This leads to SO2 emissions of between 100 and 500 mg/Nm3 depending on the amount of lime or sodium bicarbonate that is injected. Depending on the SO2 input in practice, daily averages for SOX of lower than 350 mg/Nm3 have been achieved. \n\nWith lime addition, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions concentrations of 0.2 - 1 mg/Nm3 and HCl emissions concentrations of 1 - 10 mg/Nm3 (daily average) can be achieved.\n\nThe achieved environmental levels reported for clean gas from bag filter systems are given in Table   3 .47.\n\n\nTable 3.47:\tPerformance of three sinter strand plants with bag filter systems\n\n\nTable   3 .48 shows examples of achieved emission concentration values for sinter strand emissions after dedusting with a combination of an ESP and a bag filter including statistical information and the corresponding reference time periods.\n\nTable 3.48:\tAchieved emission concentration values for sinter strand dedusting in five EU sinter plants\n\n\nFigure   3 .41 shows the daily average values for dust from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique for over 23 months (January 2008 to October 2009).\n\n\nFigure 3.41:\tDaily means for the dust emissions from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique from January 2008 to October 2009 \n\nApplying bag filters facilitates increasing the recycling of dioxin and heavy metal-containing residues. In one example the amount of recycled dust from the blast furnace gas has been increased from 6 000 tonnes to 39 000 tonnes per year .\n\nCross-media effects\nBag filters generate a solid process residue flow (0.5 to 1 kg/t sinter), which is preferably recycled into the sintering process. In some cases, the captured dust contains unwanted compounds (e.g. zinc, lead, alkalis), hampering its reuse. In this case, some or the entire solid process residues should be discarded as waste for further treatment or disposal.\n\nAt the sinter plant of ArcelorMittal Bremen in Germany that operates without desulphurisation, the separated dust and additives from the bag filter are fully returned to the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front. The separated dust at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Donawitz, Austria must be disposed of because it contains significant amounts of sulphur, chloride, fluoride and alkalis. The dust separated in the ESP (only used as a prededusting device) is recycled or disposed of depending on the alkali chloride content, which can increase the residual dust content in the treated waste gas when returned to the sinter strand.\n\nThe use of a bag filter requires the installation of new booster fans. The additional electricity energy demand including fans, heating devices, motors and auxiliary installations is approximately 1.5 kWh/1000 Nm3/h compared to 1.0 kWh/1000 Nm3/h with an ESP only. \n\nOperational data\nThe recirculation of particulates inside the system to build up a precoating layer at the surface of the bags is used to improve the dedusting efficiency and to increase the lifetime of bags.\n\nDurable bag filter material is an important aspect of this technique. Different types of filter fabric material with specific qualities can be used to achieve a balance between abatement efficiency, lifetime and costs (see Table   3 .52). \n\nThe use of activated carbon or lignite coke differs in grain size and in the effective adsorption surface area and consequently the amount of injection required. Activated coal has the highest specific free surface and shows a very good adsorptive effect. Activated lignite coke is the more economic alternative to activated coke and the super-milled lignite coke with diameters of 0.024 mm also shows a very good adsorptive efficiency and leads to half the dosing rates necessary compared to the application of standard lignite coke . Sometime inerts have to be added to the injected carbon-based materials to prevent ignition. Table   3 .49 shows the characteristics of different adsorbents and absorbent materials.\n\n\nTable 3.49:\tCharacteristics of different adsorbent and absorption materials\n\n\nTo achieve effective adsorption of the PCDD/F, it is necessary to ensure that the carbon additive is distributed rapidly across the duct section. After injection, the absorption and adsorption process starts in the ducts and continues in the filter cake. The carbon additives together with the dust are captured in the bag filter and are removed from the filter in the usual way. A significant proportion of the dust and additives is returned to the waste gas stream; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal. In some cases, the discharged dust and additives are fully returned into the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front.\n\nTable   3 .50 shows a comparison between the use of sodium bicarbonate and slaked lime. \n\n\nTable 3.50:\tTypical operational values when using sodium bicarbonate and slaked lime as additives\n\n\nBy injection of water, the temperature of the waste gas is reduced and the abatement efficiency of acid pollutants is increased. Modern bag filter techniques have systems which decrease the flue-gas temperature to 120 degC or even down to 80 degC either directly or by spraying water into the reactor chamber or indirectly by conditioning the recirculated particles with water. Freshly ground sodium bicarbonate is injected into the flue-gas duct at a temperature above 140 degC. The use of slaked lime needs more energy to reheat the gas.\n\nThere is flexibility with the use of additives (e.g. slaked lime, lignite coke, sodium bicarbonate) depending on the environmental needs. Sodium bicarbonate is used when higher desulphurisation or a deNOX system is required. Additives are stored in silos and sodium bicarbonate is milled before injection.\n\nIn order to enhance the gas cleaning efficiency and to significantly reduce additive costs, most of the separated dust in the bag filter is recycled to the off-gas stream after the conditioning reactor. Unreacted adsorbents once again come into contact with the off-gas, thus increasing the adsorbent efficiency and reducing the costs of consumables. The reaction products and the dust are usually deposited underground due to their fine grain sizes. \n\nIf carbon is used to achieve further reductions of PCDD/F emissions, then special attention has to be paid to the risk of filter fire. Spark detection equipment may be installed and when necessary, the filter is bypassed. Filters usually get bypassed during the start/shut down of the sinter strand. \n\nBag filters are divided into lines and subdivided into different chambers. When a bag filter element is broken, only the corresponding chamber has to be shut down in order to replace this filter element. \n\nApplicability\nThe bag filter can be regarded as an end-of-pipe technique which can be applied at both new and existing plants. For existing plants requirements such as space for a downstream installation to the ESP can be relevant. Special regard should be given to the age and the performance of the existing ESP.\n\nEconomics\nWhen estimating the costs of bag filter with a flow-injection unit, it should be borne in mind that these installations are not only used for dust separation but also for reducing PCDD/F, heavy metals and acid gases such as Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), HCl and SO2. The investment is in the range of EUR 16 to 35/Nm3/h (for new and existing plants).\n\nDecisive cost factors are pressure drop, the waste gas flow, fabric material and filter loading. The operating cost is around EUR 0.3 - 0.6/t sinter and mostly depends on the costs of supplying activated carbon and limestone, and the extra energy. Examples of costs are shown in Table   3 .51.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nSinter plants are the major source for dust and dioxin/furan emissions from integrated steelworks. The driving force for implementation is to meet the prescribed emission limit values for dust, heavy metals and PCDD/F, to lower national emissions to meet the national reduction goals according to national and international regulations, environmental reputation and in the case of the plant at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria improved economics compared to the AIRFINE system.\n\nAccording to the Basel Convention and the corresponding Regulation (EC) 850/2004 regarding the treatment of POP-containing waste materials, amended by Regulation (EC) 304/09/EC, transboundary shipments of wastes like iron-bearing filter dust or sludges for recycling purposes are only permissible if the receiving facility complies with an ELV for PCDD/F of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/m3. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.51:\tExamples of the cost of bag filters installed in sinter plants\n\n\nSinter off-gas cleaning system EFA at sinter plant No 2 in Dilingen is still in the trial operation phase\n\nExample plants\nBag filters have been applied to the sinter process for the dedusting of waste gas since the beginning of the 1990s. In Europe, the number of sinter plants treating the waste gases with bag filters has increased since the year 2002 and now include the following:\n\nArcelorMittal, Bremen, Germany since 1992\nDK Recycling, Duisburg, Germany\nVoestalpine Stahl GmbH, Donawitz, Austria.

A sinter off-gas cleaning system with a capacity of 600 000 Nm3/h with bag filter downstream to an ESP has been in trial operation since 2009. The system also injects hydrated lime and activated lignite coke before the bag filter. For the second sinter strand, another plant has been commissioned for a capacity of 900 000 Nm3/h.\n\nIn the US, at least three sinter plants treat the off-gases from sinter strands in bag filters:\n\nInland Steel, East Chicago, US.\nWarren Consolidated Industries (Warren Consolidated Industries (WCI)), Youngstown Sinter Company, Warren, Ohio, US.\nUS Steel, Gary Works, Gary, Indiana, US.\n\nFor the following three sinter plants, the installation of bag filters is scheduled or commissioned:\n\nThyssen Krupp Stahl, Duisburg, Germany announced to retrofit all three sinter plants with bag filters after the existing ESPs by 2011\nSalzgitter AG, Salzgitter, Germany. A sinter off-gas cleaning system with a capacity of 680 000 Nm3/h with bag filter downstream to an ESP has been commissioned. The plant is scheduled to go into full operation in March 2010\nAt Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands, trials with bag filters will be put through in 2009. Depending on the results, one of three sinter strands will be equipped with a full scale bag filter in 2010 and the other two sinter strands will be retrofitted with bag filters in 2013.\n\nReference literature\n        \n\n\nTable 3.52:\tOperational data and economics of bag filters at sinter plants\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3800241_abstract", "x": 0.7359812, "y": 0.4635006, "title": "REGULATED VACUUM OFF-GASSING OF GAS FILTER FOR FLUID PROCESSING SYSTEM AND RELATED METHODS", "year": 2021, "text": "A method for filtering a gas includes sparging a gas through a liquid within a compartment of a container.

Usually, the removal of dust is combined with the removal of acidic waste gas compounds such as HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and SOX by injection of slaked lime or sodium bicarbonate solutions and the removal of persistent organic pollutants such as PCDD/F, PCB, HCB or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) by injection of adsorbents (mainly powdered lignite coke or activated carbon, and/or sometimes zeolites) (see Figure   3 .39). All the dust, the carbon/coke and unreacted desulphurisation reagents as well as the reaction products (gypsum and sodium sulphate) are filtered off by means of the bag filter. A significant proportion of the removed dust is recirculated to the waste gas in order to increase the adsorption efficiency and thus reduce the costs for consumables. The rest is discharged out of the system for disposal. In some cases, the discharged dust and additives are returned to the sinter strand where the PCDD/F are cracked in the flame front. When combined desulphurisation is applied, the solid residues from the bag filter are usually not recycled to the sinter strand due to the release of the SO2.\nThe several steps of this combination of techniques are as follows:\n\ninjection of adsorbents (powdered lignite coke or active carbon and/or zeolites) upstream of the bag filter in the flue-gas duct to reduce the emissions of hazardous compounds\ninjection of sodium bicarbonate or slaked lime into the flue-gas duct to reduce acidic emissions (e.g. SOX, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF)) combined with an adequate conditioning of the waste gas by moisturisation and temperature adjustment (90 - 100 degC) \ndust capture in a chemical-resistant bag filter with an automatic dust removal system (e.g. pulse-jet type)\nrecycling of dust back to the flue-gas upstream of the bag filter. In some cases, a large amount of particulates is recirculated\nextraction of flue-gases from the system with a fan.\n\nThe injection of alkaline compounds, usually lime, also help to prevent the blinding of the filter material by fine particulates or organic compounds and to avoid corrosion. The lime builds up a layer on the surface of the bag (precoating the bag) preventing the formation of an impermeable layer and consequently blinding the filter material.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, more details on the techniques are provided.\n\nFor the treatment of the acidic compounds in the waste gas from sinter strands, usually a 'semi-dry sorption process' is used. This means that additional water is applied in order to cool the off-gas temperature to 90 - 100 degC for an efficient desulphurisation and also to avoid potential damage to the downstream fabric filter bags. The water can be sprayed directly into the waste gas flow. \n\nIn bag filter systems with dust recirculation (see Figure   3 .39) there is generally a mixer for the recirculated dusts and any fresh additives (slaked lime and/or carbon). To facilitate desulphurisation of the waste gas, moisture is added to the dust in the mixer. The amount of water added is dependent upon the waste gas temperature and this can affect the degree of desulphurisation achieved. The desulphurisation rate is determined by the amount of lime added, by the rate of recirculation of the collected dusts, and by the moisture content of the recirculated dust. Desulphurisation also depends on the quality of hydrated lime.\n\nUsually the filter is divided into several filter lines of similar design, each of which is further subdivided into several chambers. The prededusted waste gas stream is distributed uniformly to the top of each of the filter lines and is sucked to the bottom of each chamber. Within the chamber, the waste gas enters from the outside of the filter tube and dust is collected on the fabric as the gas passes through the bag. The bags are supported by cages and can be mounted vertically (longer bags) or horizontally (shorter bags). During waste gas cleaning, a filter cake builds up on the exterior surface of the bag resulting in an increase in the pressure drop across the bag. Once the pressure drop reaches a set point (usual differential pressure between the filter and the clean gas chamber of 10 to 20 mbar) the chamber is taken off-line for cleaning by a reverse pulse of compressed air. The dust removed is collected in conical bins below the filter chambers and discharged by screw conveyors. About 98 % of this dust may be recycled back to the waste gas stream as an additive; the rest is discharged out of the system for disposal or optionally sent back to the sinter strand.\n\nAn example of the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter is the MEROS(r) process (Maximised Emission Reduction of Sintering). The full size installation has been in operation on a sinter machine of 222 m2 at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria since August 2007 and replaced the AIRFINE system.\n\nOther examples for the combined reduction of solid and gaseous pollutants by bag filter are the TFA process (Treatment des Fumes d'Agglomeration) at ArcelorMittal, Fos sur Mer, France or the EFA sintering technology which is applied at Rogesa, Dillingen, Germany. Whereas the TFA process at Fos sur Mer has been in operation since 2006, the EFA process at the sinter plant No 2 in Dillingen is in the trial operation phase.\n\nFigure   3 .39 shows a basic flow sheet of a bag filter applied downstream of an ESP or a cyclone.\n\n\nFigure 3.39:\tBasic flow sheet of a bag filter downstream of an existing ESP or cyclone\n\n\nFigure   3 .40 shows a typical flow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.40:\tFlow scheme of a sinter plant with a SIMETAL MEROS(r) system added\n\n\nAlthough this technique is different in process layout, the processes mentioned above have in common that the conventional use of additives like activated carbon or activated lignite coke for heavy metals and PCDD/F removal is accompanied by dust recycling and SOX abatement in case of additional lime and water injection .\n\nThe abated dust consists of primary dust, carbon/coke and non-reacted deSOX reagents.

In particular, emissions of PCDD/F may be reduced significantly. A significant removal of VOCs and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) is also reported.\n\nOperational data for European sinter plants using bag filters are usually in the range of 1 to 10 mg/Nm3 particulates expressed on a daily average basis that includes peak periods.

For example, mercury is reduced by 80 - 95 %. \n\nSO2 can be reduced by approximately 30 - 80 % with slaked lime and up to 90 % with sodium bicarbonate. This leads to SO2 emissions of between 100 and 500 mg/Nm3 depending on the amount of lime or sodium bicarbonate that is injected. Depending on the SO2 input in practice, daily averages for SOX of lower than 350 mg/Nm3 have been achieved. \n\nWith lime addition, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) emissions concentrations of 0.2 - 1 mg/Nm3 and HCl emissions concentrations of 1 - 10 mg/Nm3 (daily average) can be achieved.\n\nThe achieved environmental levels reported for clean gas from bag filter systems are given in Table   3 .47.\n\n\nTable 3.47:\tPerformance of three sinter strand plants with bag filter systems\n\n\nTable   3 .48 shows examples of achieved emission concentration values for sinter strand emissions after dedusting with a combination of an ESP and a bag filter including statistical information and the corresponding reference time periods.\n\nTable 3.48:\tAchieved emission concentration values for sinter strand dedusting in five EU sinter plants\n\n\nFigure   3 .41 shows the daily average values for dust from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique for over 23 months (January 2008 to October 2009).\n\n\nFigure 3.41:\tDaily means for the dust emissions from one sinter strand equipped with a bag filter technique from January 2008 to October 2009 \n\nApplying bag filters facilitates increasing the recycling of dioxin and heavy metal-containing residues.

In 2004, these furnaces averaged an oil injection rate of 45.5 kg/t hot metal and a Coke Oven Gas (COG) rate of 46.9 kg/t hot metal with a total equivalent coke rate of 477.8 kg/t hot metal. The Eta-CO was 43.5 with about 8 % H2 in the Blast Furnace (BF) gas.\n\nThe maximum level for Coke Oven Gas (COG) injection at the tuyere level is thought to be 100 kg/t hot metal. This limit is set by the thermochemical conditions in the furnace. The Coke Oven Gas (COG) contains residual H2S and organic sulphur compounds. The real input of Coke Oven Gas (COG) is much lower (see Table   6 .100). The concentration level of these sulphur compounds depends on the level of sulphur in the coals and/or the desulphurisation efficiency of the plant. The use of Coke Oven Gas (COG) in the Blast Furnace (BF) process as a reductant instead of using it as a fuel elsewhere in the works could result in a reduction in the sulphur emissions from the works since a proportion of the sulphur will be captured in the Blast Furnace (BF) slag. \n\nAn example of the layout for Coke Oven Gas (COG) injection is shown in Figure   6 .103.\n\n\nFigure 6.103:\tExample of the layout for Coke Oven Gas (COG) injection\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nNo data submitted. \n\nCross-media effects\nNo data submitted. \n\nOperational data\nThe replacement ratio for Coke Oven Gas (COG) is about 1 kg of gas for 0.98 kg coke or 0.81 kg of heavy oil. Additionally, the replacement of a carbon-rich reductant like coke and heavy oil in the Blast Furnace (BF) process by a carbon-lean reductant like Coke Oven Gas (COG) leads to an absolute reduction of the CO2 emissions from the Blast Furnace (BF) process. When Coke Oven Gas (COG) is used at the blast furnace, it is necessary to substitute this gas that is normally used in reheat furnaces, etc. with Blast Furnace (BF) gas, Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) gas or natural gas. A consequential reduction of SO2 emissions of between 70 and 90 % may then result at these former Coke Oven Gas (COG) consumers.\n\nA reduction of the hot metal sulphur content may also be possible because Coke Oven Gas (COG) has a lower sulphur input than heavy oil or coke. The consumption of desulphurisation agents (e.g. lime, CaC2, Mg) at the pretreatment desulphurisation process of the hot metal can then be reduced. A compressor unit is required for Coke Oven Gas (COG) injection resulting in an additional energy consumption of about 204 kWh/t Coke Oven Gas (COG) (based on consumption at a reference plant in 2005).\n\nApplicability\nWhilst tuyere injection of Coke Oven Gas (COG) is also applicable both at new and existing blast furnaces, it is also highly dependent upon the availability of the gas that may be effectively used elsewhere in the integrated steelworks. Direct injection of reducing agents is applicable both at new and existing blast furnaces.\n\nEconomics\nNo data submitted. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driving forces are both economic and environmental benefits as a result of improved Blast Furnace (BF) operation.\n\nThe investment at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH for the gas injection plant was about EUR 10 million for a production of about 5000 tonnes hot metal per day. The total specific operational costs are: EUR 1.3/t hot metal or EUR 12/1000 m3 Coke Oven Gas (COG) (EUR 2 400 000/year and 200 million m3 Coke Oven Gas (COG)/year).\n\nExample plants\nCoke Oven Gas (COG) injection into blast furnaces is a technique applied in Europe at Voestalpine Stahl GmbH, Linz, Austria. \n\nReference literature\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3040137_abstract", "x": 0.531893, "y": 0.44443843, "title": "CONTINUOUS CASTING METHOD", "year": 2016, "text": "In a continuous casting device 100 for casting a stainless steel billet 3c, a long nozzle 2 extending into a tundish 101 is provided at a ladle 1.

If significant fume generation cannot be avoided, then fume collection and abatement should be used. As in the case of continuous casting, dedicated fume extraction equipment and cleaning is essential for leaded steels.\n\nThe oxy-gas cutting equipment used when cutting stainless steel is fed with iron powder. This produces sufficient brown fume to justify fitting fume extraction and abatement equipment, such as bag filters. \n\nWhen casting leaded steels or when making lead additions, the top of the ladle and tundish can be covered. Careful consideration of injection plant design is required to minimise the risk of releasing lead fume. Fume collection should be provided around the mould area and for the secondary steelmaking unit itself, with extraction to a bag filter dedicated to treating lead-bearing fume.\n\nIf oxygen lancing is used to clear the nozzle, the fume should be confined and extracted, together with the other lead-bearing fumes.

One option is to use the sensible heat for scrap preheating. The scrap can be preheated to approximately 800 - 1000 degC with discontinuous systems and to 300 - 400 degC with continuous systems prior to the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) melting process which reduces the total energy consumption by up to 100 kWh/t LS. \n\nSuch preheating is performed either in the scrap charging baskets or in a charging shaft (shaft furnace) added to the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or in a specially designed scrap conveying system allowing continuous charging during the melting process. In some cases, even additional fossil energy is added in the preheating process . \n\nThe shaft technology has been developed in steps. In 1988, Fuchs Systemtechnik GmbH, now SIEMENS VAI Metals Technologies, started a development to overcome the shortfalls of the scrap bucket preheaters and opted for direct charging of the scrap into a shaft that was positioned on the roof of the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). With the single shaft furnace 100 % of the scrap can be preheated .\n\nA further modification is the double shaft furnace which consists of two identical shaft furnaces (twin shell arrangement) which are positioned next to each other and are serviced by a single set of electrode arms. The scrap is partly preheated by off-gas and partly by side wall burners.\n\nA very efficient shaft furnace design is the finger shaft furnace. The finger shaft design uses a unique scrap retaining system with fingers which allows the preheating of 100 % of the scrap amount . The first basket is preheated during the refining of the previous heat and the second during the melting down of the first one. In 1994, the first finger shaft furnace started up at Hylsa in Monterrey, Mexico. Through the utilisation of the furnace off-gas during the heat cycle, scrap can be preheated to a temperature of approximately 1000 degC prior to the final melting in the furnace vessel. This means considerable energy and cost savings with a substantial reduction in tap-to-tap times. The 4th generation of Siemens VAI preheating Shaft technology were installed in January 2008 in Stahl Gerlafingen with an more efficient charging system into the shaft in addition to improved scrap preheating. The average additional energy savings for this system are in the range of 10 kWh per tonne of LS.\n\nAll occurring emissions from the scrap preheating systems can be combusted in a separate downstream combustion chamber.\n\nSince the year 2000, continuous scrap preheating and feeding became very popular, e.g. CONSTEEL (see Figure   8 .146) . The scrap is charged by cranes on a special conveyor belt. In the preheating section the charge receives heat from the off-gases leaving the furnace. The scrap flow is adjusted to the power input of the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). The charge is melted by immersion in a molten pool, heated by the energy coming from the electric arcs and from the chemical reactions taking place in the melt, in contrast to conventional top-charge Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) where the melting is provided by direct heat transfer from the electric arc. The bath is always covered by a foaming slag which is constantly promoted by controlled carbon and oxygen injection.\n\nAnother recently developed continuous feeding scrap preheating process is the COSS technology (see Table   8 .170) .\n\n\nFigure 8.146:\tSchematic of the CONSTEEL process\n\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nWith shaft furnaces, very high scrap preheating temperatures of up to 800 - 1000 degC can be achieved. With the described techniques for scrap preheating 70 - 100 kWh/t LS energy can be saved which is about 10 - 25 % of the overall electricity input. Calculated on the basis of primary energy, the savings might be higher considering the efficiency of energy supply. In addition, the two scrap preheating solutions reduce the tap-to-tap time since less electric energy needs to be put into the charge and downtime for batch charging is reduced.\n\nIn combination with an advanced off-gas treatment, scrap preheating plays a significant role in the optimisation of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking, not only related to productivity but also to the minimisation of emissions.\n\nAs a side effect, scrap preheating reduces raw dust emissions by about 20 % because the off-gas has to pass through the scrap which acts as a filter. This reduction correlates with an increase in the zinc content in the dust which supports its recycling. \nWith the continuous feeding systems, the scrap can be heated up to an average temperature of 300 degC, thus the efficiency of the furnace is increased and energy consumption is reduced. But the continuous feeding has some additional advantages including lower noise emissions.\n\nAll CO and H2 are considered to have evolved from the melting process and are burnt to CO2 and H2O inside the preheater. The continuity of the process allows for achieving a stable off-gas exit temperature between 800 and 1100 degC, with an oxygen excess of 8 - 10 %, which allows for the complete destruction of PCDD/F. Provided that the off-gases are rapidly cooled below 200 to 250 degC, the risk of PCDD/F formation by de novo synthesis is considerably reduced. \n\nNevertheless, experiences from at least two continuous charging installations showed a high emissions concentrations for PCDD/F exceeding the value of 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 significantly . That means that additional measures for reducing PCDD/F to ensure emissions concentrations for PCDD/F below 0.1 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 may be necessary also for continuous charging techniques from case to case. Table   8 .169 shows the measurement results of a continuous pollution measurement from one installation for an eight year operating period.\n\n\nTable 8.169:\tPollution measurements from one installation for an eight year operating period\n\n\nAt the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) Mo i Rana in 2008, a CONSTEEL furnace has been realised. To reduce the emissions of dust, dioxins and mercury downstream of the bag filter, a carbon filter has been installed. Measurements carried out both before and after the application of the Consteel furnace show that the dixions and mercury have been reduced by more than 90 %.\n\nCross-media effects\nScrap preheating looks very attractive from the point of view of energy management. But the scrap preheating may lead to an important generation of organic pollutants due to the possible presence of organic substances on the scrap. Due to the process-specific low temperatures in the scrap column, the organic constituents adhering to the scrap, such as oils and greases, are only evaporated off but not thermally destroyed; one result here being the formation of volatile organic chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds and the precursor of PCDD/F .\n\nAs mentioned before, high emissions of aromatic organohalogen compounds such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/F), chlorobenzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH)) and other partial combustion products may occur from scrap contaminated with paints, plastics, lubricants or other organic compounds. In one Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) with conventional scrap preheating, up to 9.2 ng I-TEQ/Nm3 have been measured.\n\nThese emissions can be minimised by post-combustion of the off-gas in a specially designed post-combustion chamber equipped with fossil fuel burners. Due to the high temperature to be reached in order to destroy the POPs (persistent organic pollutants) that are present in the off-gas, the amount of energy required is considerable and of the order of magnitude of the energy savings provided by scrap preheating. \n\nOperational data\nSince its start-up, no CONSTEEL furnace has been stopped. The following table shows some operational data for selected scrap preheating systems applied to Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) furnaces.\n\nTable 8.170:\tProcess data from selected scrap preheating systems applied to Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) furnaces\n\n\nApplicability\nThe CONSTEEL process is applicable to both new and existing plants. In existing plants, the local conditions related to the space availability and limitations for the conveyor installation and the scrapyard positioning have to be considered which may sometimes prevent the installation of such a technique. Scrap preheating systems do not require specially sized scrap more than the conventional Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). The scrapyard groundwork is equivalent compared to the buckets-operating furnaces.\n\nEconomics\nWith finger shaft EAFs, tap-to-tap times of about 35 minutes are achieved which is about 10 - 15 minutes shorter compared with Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) without efficient scrap preheating. This allows for a very short payback time which is in the order of one year.\n\nAs an example, for a new steelmaking plant, producing about one million tonnes per year, the Consteel implementation usually represents about 10 -15 % of the total investment.\n\nThe cost of a revamping is in a range of EUR 5 million - 10 million and varies a lot according to the size of the furnace, layout and to the extent of the required modifications.\n\nThe overall cost savings achievable with the CONSTEEL process for a melt shop of one million tonnes per year productivity is around EUR 9.5 per tonne LS. \n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe main driving force is to increase productivity, to reach a higher charge yield and lower conversion costs combined with a lower environmental impact. In some cases, scrap preheating by means of a finger shaft furnace has been installed in combination with advanced off-gas treatment.\n\nAnother main driver is the reduction in electrical disturbances in plants where the electrical power supply network is an issue. \n\nExample plants\n\nTwin-shell shaft furnace with integrated preheating in a shaft: ASW, Montereau, France\nTwo-finger shaft furnaces and one shaft furnace, Zhangjiagang, P.

After waste gases are cooled, SO2 is absorbed in a spray tower with a solution which contains calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg). This forms gypsum (CaSO4) or magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), which is removed from the column as a slurry. Several reaction agents may be used:\n\nsteel slag (steel slag desulphurisation (Steel Slag Desulphurisation (SSD)) process). Steel slag, which contains          30 - 40 % CaO is pulverised, mixed with water and added as a slurry which contains Ca(OH)2\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\ncalcium chloride (CaCl2) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2) and chalk (CaCO3)\nmagnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2).\n\nThe gypsum is dewatered. Its quality strongly depends on the efficiency of the preinstalled dust abatement device. In some countries, this gypsum can be sold to the cement manufacturing industry.\n\nWater is separated from the gypsum slurry and most of it is recirculated. Because of chloride build-up, there will be a scrubbing water bleed. Thus, both a solid (gypsum) and waste water are generated.\n\nWhen ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) is used as a reaction agent, an ammonium hydrogen sulphite (NH4HSO3) solution is generated. This solution is processed by wet oxidation in the gas treatment plant of the coke oven producing ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4).\n\nWet desulphurisation can be also achieved with fine scrubber systems (see Section 3.3.2.4).\n\nActivated lignite coke can also be injected into the flue-gas for PCDD/F adsorption. After this reaction, the activated lignite coke is separated by a bag filter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDesulphurisation efficiencies of 85 - 90 % can be achieved, although efficiencies of 95 - 99 % have been reported. With these performance values, less than 200 mg/Nm3 of SOX have been reported for input values below 1.5 g/Nm3. Furthermore, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and dust are scrubbed from the waste gas. The system does not remove NOX.\n\nCross-media effects\nA slurry that contains gypsum is generated. The disposal of the gypsum can create considerable problems. In countries where there is no market for gypsum, the dewatered material should be disposed of as an active waste, requiring further stabilisation before dumping and thereby generating higher disposal costs. Even where there is a market for gypsum, the contamination of the product with dust makes it less attractive and it may have to be disposed of. Furthermore, additional waste water treatment is necessary when the unit removes dust simultaneously.\n\nIn one case, the gypsum was separated in a contaminated part (10 %), which was disposed of, and a 'clean' part (90 %), which was sold. But this system is no longer in operation.\n\nMost of the scrubbing water can be recirculated, especially when a dust abatement device is used prior to the desulphurisation unit. A bleed is usually needed to avoid the build-up of chloride. Bleeds in the range of 5 to 20 m3/h are reported. However, in some cases no bleed occurs and water is supplemented.\n\nElectricity consumption is estimated at 6.1 - 7.2 MJ/t sinter. Furthermore, the cleaned waste gas should be reheated before being emitted in order to achieve a sufficient plume rise. In some cases, coke oven gas is used for this purpose and sometimes the CO present in the sinter plant waste gas is catalytically combusted.\n\nSlaked lime consumption depends on the SO2 inlet concentration, the amount of waste gas treated and the desired efficiency. Reported consumption is 3 - 4 kg slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) per m3 SO2 at Wakamatsu Works, NSC, Japan.\n\nOperational data\nTable   3 .58 gives an overview of operational and economic data from three desulphurisation units. All these units have been installed to meet environmental regulations set by the local authorities.

After waste gases are cooled, SO2 is absorbed in a spray tower with a solution which contains calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg). This forms gypsum (CaSO4) or magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), which is removed from the column as a slurry. Several reaction agents may be used:\n\nsteel slag (steel slag desulphurisation (Steel Slag Desulphurisation (SSD)) process). Steel slag, which contains          30 - 40 % CaO is pulverised, mixed with water and added as a slurry which contains Ca(OH)2\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\ncalcium chloride (CaCl2) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2) and chalk (CaCO3)\nmagnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2).\n\nThe gypsum is dewatered. Its quality strongly depends on the efficiency of the preinstalled dust abatement device. In some countries, this gypsum can be sold to the cement manufacturing industry.\n\nWater is separated from the gypsum slurry and most of it is recirculated. Because of chloride build-up, there will be a scrubbing water bleed. Thus, both a solid (gypsum) and waste water are generated.\n\nWhen ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) is used as a reaction agent, an ammonium hydrogen sulphite (NH4HSO3) solution is generated. This solution is processed by wet oxidation in the gas treatment plant of the coke oven producing ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4).\n\nWet desulphurisation can be also achieved with fine scrubber systems (see Section 3.3.2.4).\n\nActivated lignite coke can also be injected into the flue-gas for PCDD/F adsorption. After this reaction, the activated lignite coke is separated by a bag filter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDesulphurisation efficiencies of 85 - 90 % can be achieved, although efficiencies of 95 - 99 % have been reported. With these performance values, less than 200 mg/Nm3 of SOX have been reported for input values below 1.5 g/Nm3. Furthermore, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and dust are scrubbed from the waste gas. The system does not remove NOX.\n\nCross-media effects\nA slurry that contains gypsum is generated. The disposal of the gypsum can create considerable problems. In countries where there is no market for gypsum, the dewatered material should be disposed of as an active waste, requiring further stabilisation before dumping and thereby generating higher disposal costs. Even where there is a market for gypsum, the contamination of the product with dust makes it less attractive and it may have to be disposed of. Furthermore, additional waste water treatment is necessary when the unit removes dust simultaneously.\n\nIn one case, the gypsum was separated in a contaminated part (10 %), which was disposed of, and a 'clean' part (90 %), which was sold. But this system is no longer in operation.\n\nMost of the scrubbing water can be recirculated, especially when a dust abatement device is used prior to the desulphurisation unit. A bleed is usually needed to avoid the build-up of chloride. Bleeds in the range of 5 to 20 m3/h are reported. However, in some cases no bleed occurs and water is supplemented.\n\nElectricity consumption is estimated at 6.1 - 7.2 MJ/t sinter. Furthermore, the cleaned waste gas should be reheated before being emitted in order to achieve a sufficient plume rise. In some cases, coke oven gas is used for this purpose and sometimes the CO present in the sinter plant waste gas is catalytically combusted.\n\nSlaked lime consumption depends on the SO2 inlet concentration, the amount of waste gas treated and the desired efficiency. Reported consumption is 3 - 4 kg slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) per m3 SO2 at Wakamatsu Works, NSC, Japan.\n\nOperational data\nTable   3 .58 gives an overview of operational and economic data from three desulphurisation units.

After waste gases are cooled, SO2 is absorbed in a spray tower with a solution which contains calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg). This forms gypsum (CaSO4) or magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), which is removed from the column as a slurry. Several reaction agents may be used:\n\nsteel slag (steel slag desulphurisation (Steel Slag Desulphurisation (SSD)) process). Steel slag, which contains          30 - 40 % CaO is pulverised, mixed with water and added as a slurry which contains Ca(OH)2\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\ncalcium chloride (CaCl2) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2) and chalk (CaCO3)\nmagnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2).\n\nThe gypsum is dewatered. Its quality strongly depends on the efficiency of the preinstalled dust abatement device. In some countries, this gypsum can be sold to the cement manufacturing industry.\n\nWater is separated from the gypsum slurry and most of it is recirculated. Because of chloride build-up, there will be a scrubbing water bleed. Thus, both a solid (gypsum) and waste water are generated.\n\nWhen ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) is used as a reaction agent, an ammonium hydrogen sulphite (NH4HSO3) solution is generated. This solution is processed by wet oxidation in the gas treatment plant of the coke oven producing ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4).\n\nWet desulphurisation can be also achieved with fine scrubber systems (see Section 3.3.2.4).\n\nActivated lignite coke can also be injected into the flue-gas for PCDD/F adsorption. After this reaction, the activated lignite coke is separated by a bag filter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDesulphurisation efficiencies of 85 - 90 % can be achieved, although efficiencies of 95 - 99 % have been reported. With these performance values, less than 200 mg/Nm3 of SOX have been reported for input values below 1.5 g/Nm3. Furthermore, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and dust are scrubbed from the waste gas. The system does not remove NOX.\n\nCross-media effects\nA slurry that contains gypsum is generated. The disposal of the gypsum can create considerable problems. In countries where there is no market for gypsum, the dewatered material should be disposed of as an active waste, requiring further stabilisation before dumping and thereby generating higher disposal costs. Even where there is a market for gypsum, the contamination of the product with dust makes it less attractive and it may have to be disposed of. Furthermore, additional waste water treatment is necessary when the unit removes dust simultaneously.\n\nIn one case, the gypsum was separated in a contaminated part (10 %), which was disposed of, and a 'clean' part (90 %), which was sold. But this system is no longer in operation.\n\nMost of the scrubbing water can be recirculated, especially when a dust abatement device is used prior to the desulphurisation unit. A bleed is usually needed to avoid the build-up of chloride. Bleeds in the range of 5 to 20 m3/h are reported. However, in some cases no bleed occurs and water is supplemented.\n\nElectricity consumption is estimated at 6.1 - 7.2 MJ/t sinter. Furthermore, the cleaned waste gas should be reheated before being emitted in order to achieve a sufficient plume rise. In some cases, coke oven gas is used for this purpose and sometimes the CO present in the sinter plant waste gas is catalytically combusted.\n\nSlaked lime consumption depends on the SO2 inlet concentration, the amount of waste gas treated and the desired efficiency. Reported consumption is 3 - 4 kg slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) per m3 SO2 at Wakamatsu Works, NSC, Japan.\n\nOperational data\nTable   3 .58 gives an overview of operational and economic data from three desulphurisation units.

After waste gases are cooled, SO2 is absorbed in a spray tower with a solution which contains calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg). This forms gypsum (CaSO4) or magnesium sulphate (MgSO4), which is removed from the column as a slurry. Several reaction agents may be used:\n\nsteel slag (steel slag desulphurisation (Steel Slag Desulphurisation (SSD)) process). Steel slag, which contains          30 - 40 % CaO is pulverised, mixed with water and added as a slurry which contains Ca(OH)2\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\ncalcium chloride (CaCl2) and slaked lime (Ca(OH)2)\nslaked lime (Ca(OH)2) and chalk (CaCO3)\nmagnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2).\n\nThe gypsum is dewatered. Its quality strongly depends on the efficiency of the preinstalled dust abatement device. In some countries, this gypsum can be sold to the cement manufacturing industry.\n\nWater is separated from the gypsum slurry and most of it is recirculated. Because of chloride build-up, there will be a scrubbing water bleed. Thus, both a solid (gypsum) and waste water are generated.\n\nWhen ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) is used as a reaction agent, an ammonium hydrogen sulphite (NH4HSO3) solution is generated. This solution is processed by wet oxidation in the gas treatment plant of the coke oven producing ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4).\n\nWet desulphurisation can be also achieved with fine scrubber systems (see Section 3.3.2.4).\n\nActivated lignite coke can also be injected into the flue-gas for PCDD/F adsorption. After this reaction, the activated lignite coke is separated by a bag filter.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDesulphurisation efficiencies of 85 - 90 % can be achieved, although efficiencies of 95 - 99 % have been reported. With these performance values, less than 200 mg/Nm3 of SOX have been reported for input values below 1.5 g/Nm3. Furthermore, HCl, Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) and dust are scrubbed from the waste gas. The system does not remove NOX.\n\nCross-media effects\nA slurry that contains gypsum is generated. The disposal of the gypsum can create considerable problems. In countries where there is no market for gypsum, the dewatered material should be disposed of as an active waste, requiring further stabilisation before dumping and thereby generating higher disposal costs. Even where there is a market for gypsum, the contamination of the product with dust makes it less attractive and it may have to be disposed of. Furthermore, additional waste water treatment is necessary when the unit removes dust simultaneously.\n\nIn one case, the gypsum was separated in a contaminated part (10 %), which was disposed of, and a 'clean' part (90 %), which was sold. But this system is no longer in operation.\n\nMost of the scrubbing water can be recirculated, especially when a dust abatement device is used prior to the desulphurisation unit. A bleed is usually needed to avoid the build-up of chloride. Bleeds in the range of 5 to 20 m3/h are reported. However, in some cases no bleed occurs and water is supplemented.\n\nElectricity consumption is estimated at 6.1 - 7.2 MJ/t sinter. Furthermore, the cleaned waste gas should be reheated before being emitted in order to achieve a sufficient plume rise. In some cases, coke oven gas is used for this purpose and sometimes the CO present in the sinter plant waste gas is catalytically combusted.\n\nSlaked lime consumption depends on the SO2 inlet concentration, the amount of waste gas treated and the desired efficiency. Reported consumption is 3 - 4 kg slaked lime (Ca(OH)2) per m3 SO2 at Wakamatsu Works, NSC, Japan.\n\nOperational data\nTable   3 .58 gives an overview of operational and economic data from three desulphurisation units. All these units have been installed to meet environmental regulations set by the local authorities.

LKAB has already investigated the possibilities of end-of-pipe techniques for existing plants. Generally, the temperatures are too low to optimise the abatement of NOX. Therefore, the gas flow must be preheated in this kind of installation, which involves negative effects like increased fuel use and consequently higher emissions and costs. \n\nApplicability\nFor the existing plants, both straight grate and grate kiln systems, it is difficult to obtain the operating conditions necessary to suit an Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) reactor. For a new pelletising plant, however, the plant and the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system can be correctly designed with respect to the required temperature of the reactor and moderate gas flows. Due to high costs, the end-of-pipe nitrogen oxide reduction of waste gas should only be considered in circumstances where environmental quality standards are otherwise not likely to be met.\n\nEconomics\nNo data submitted.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe driving force is to lower national emissions to meet the national reduction goals according to national and international regulations.\n\nExample plants\nLKAB will be involved in an extensive research programme on NOX abatement until 2010. In this respect, it has been decided that the new pellet plant KK4 in Kiruna, Sweden, will be equipped with a deNOX facility.\n\nThe Alstom selective catalytic reduction (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)) reactor was installed in KK4 for a full-scale pilot test. The test started in spring 2008 and the result will be reported by the end of 2009.

The highly basic slag from stainless steel plants contains Ca2S, which undergoes a phase transformation during cooling. The transformation includes a certain increase in volume. By quenching the slag, the phase transformation can be suppressed and no dusting will occur. At Sandvik Materials Technology, Sandviken, Sweden, the problem with dust formation has been solved by emptying slag pots filled with hot and partially liquid slag into a box surrounded by a retaining dike. Then 12 m3 of water is flooded over the slag. The quick drop in temperature together with the binding of small particles with water has proven to eliminate the spreading of dust over large areas. The water itself is recirculated via a basin.\ne)\ttechniques for stainless steel slag are:\nthe stabilisation of the slag by the use of a stabilising agent to prevent pulverisation\nthe control of the slag composition\nthe minimisation of the leaching of chromium from slag materials, nearly no Cr occurs in the eluate (Cr below the detection limit value of 0.01 mg/l)\ncontrol of the slag cooling\nmetal separation by crushing, screening, gravity and magnetic separation.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThese techniques can improve the properties of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slags by fixing the chromium in a stable slag lattice and can reduce the content of Cr in the eluate.\n\nFor technique d) according to estimations from the early implementation of the technique, the dusting was reduced by more than 90 %.

This technique comprises different sources such as the hearth laying, the strand discharge zone with crushing and sieving, and transfer points of the sinter conveyor. The evacuated gases are usually treated in a dedusting device, like an ESP or bag filter. Operations are performed in a closed building to further help the collection of diffuse/fugitive emissions. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nAt one sinter plant, the majority of these evacuated gas streams from these sinter plant operations and from transfer points are combined and dedusted in three parallel ESPs. The dust emissions are measured continuously and have a yearly value of 270 t, for a combined gas flow of approximately 815 000 m3/h. The dust concentration is approximately 35 mg/Nm3. \n\nAt a German plant, sinter room dedusting emissions of <4 mg dust/Nm3 are achieved as an annual mean with bag filters . Another German plant achieves <21 mg dust/Nm3 for room dedusting and <18 mg dust/Nm3 for the sinter cooler dedusting. In both cases, ESPs are applied and the values are half-hourly averages, measured continuously. A third German sinter plant achieves <19 mg dust/Nm3 for the dedusting of the hot crusher and handover points with an ESP (daily average value). In another German plant, the room dedusting is carried out with an ESP and for parts of the off-gases from sinter cooling with a fabric filter (Fabric Filter (FF)). The corresponding achieved emission concentrations are 25 for an ESP and <15 mg dust/Nm3 for the Fabric Filter (FF) .\n\nIn one Austrian plant, the room dedusting including sinter discharge, crushing, screening and sinter conveying is carried out with an ESP and with an Fabric Filter (FF). The off-gases are merged and the achieved emission concentration is <16 mg dust/Nm3 (half-hourly average). Another Austrian sinter plant achieves values of 3 mg dust/Nm3 . \n\nCross-media effects\nNo data submitted.\n\nOperational data\nNo data submitted.\n\nApplicability\n\nSecondary dedusting is used for all of the elements of preparatory and support processes which result in emissions of pollution to the air including transhipment points, mix or sinter burdening, and sinter cooling, blending, screening and crushing operations.\n\nEconomics\nFor the mentioned example with a gas flow of 815 000 m3/h, the investments costs for the bag filters were EUR 12 million and the operational yearly costs are EUR 3.25 million.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nThe various sinter plant operations like blending, crushing, cooling and screening as well as transport (especially at the transfer points between the conveyor belts) and recycling of the sinter between these different operations are a source of dust emissions. The dust consists of 75 % PM10 and 35 % PM2.5.\n\nExample plants \nAt the sinter plant from Voestalpine Stahl Linz, Austria a collection and cleaning of one part of the flue-gas (370 000 m3/h) is performed with ESPs. Another part of the flue-gas (160 000 m3/h) is dedusted in a bag filter.\n\nIn a Dutch sinter plant, the off-gas from the charging zone is dedusted by means of a bag filter. The emissions from discharging, crushing and screening zones, from conveyers and from parts of the cooler are extracted and dedusted by means of ESPs . \n\nAt ArcelorMittal, Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany the dedusting of the emissions of the cooling strand and other secondary sources is carried out with ESP.\n\nThe Thyssen Krupp Stahl, Duisburg, Germany installation has the particular characteristic of having the sinter cooler situated close to the boundary of the iron and steel works. Measurements have proven that these emissions make a relevant contribution to the dust deposition in the area beyond the boundary of the plant. For this reason, a cooler dedusting system was installed and started up in April 2003. The dust created by the transport, handling and cooling of the sinter is collected. The dust-laden air from the cooler, hot screens and some other plant areas are separated from the existing plant dedusting facility and fed to a new ESP. Diffuse emissions are considerably reduced from the cooler area by optimising the airflow rates in the dedusting system at the various extraction points ensuring a relatively high flow (300 000 Nm3/h) at the strand discharge area. An installed ESP treats a total waste airflow rate of approximately 1 400 000 Nm3/h and it was designed to achieve a particulate content of 30 mg/Nm3 at discharge, measured as a half-hourly mean value. The dust collected in the ESP is sent by a chain conveyor to a surge bin. After that, it is wetted and sent to the fine ore beds by conveyor belts.\n\nReference literature\n    \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3406745_abstract", "x": 0.46629152, "y": 0.30327034, "title": "PROCESSING OF A WASTE METAL MATERIAL COMPRISING AN IRON COMPONENT AND A NON-IRON METAL COMPONENT", "year": 2018, "text": "The present invention relates to a method for processing a metal containing material, comprising at least one non-iron metal component and at least one iron component, wherein the metal containing material is at least partly separated into a solid iron oxide component and into at least part of the at least one non-iron metal component, the method comprising the following steps:\n-- in a precipitation step, at least part of the at least one non-iron metal component is precipitated in an acid solution, the acid solution comprising the metal containing material and an added iron component, being added to the acid solution and comprising either a further iron component and/or an iron component in the form of an iron salt component, and, by means of the precipitation step, at least part of the at least one non-iron metal component is removed from the remaining acid solution, remaining after the precipitation step and comprising either at least part of the at least one iron component and/or at least part of the added iron component,\n-- in a hydrolysis step, the remaining acid solution is at least partly hydrolyzed, at least partly yielding a solid iron oxide component, an acid component, and optionally a remaining part of the iron salt component.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"6.3.9\" title=\"Use of high quality ores\">\n\n<content>\nUse of high quality ores \n\nDescription\nThe idea of this technique is to use preferably sinter or pellets as raw material with a high iron content and low gangue content. Sinter with an iron content of 61 - 63.5 % and pellets with an iron content in the range of 66.6 - 66.8 % are used. Other important factors are moderate ash content of coke and low ash content of coal for injection.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe use of high quality ores increases the productivity and the energy efficiency of the ironmaking process. The consumption of reducing agents is lower, which leads to reduced CO2 emissions. A yield of 3.4 tonnes/m3/day and reduction of CO2 emissions by 15 - 80 kg/t of hot metal can be achieved. Additionally, the slag volume is reduced to about 150 - 200 kg/t hot metal which also lowers the emissions from slag processing. \n\nCross-media effects\nNo data submitted.\n\nOperational data\nUsing sinter and pellets very rich in iron as raw materials is, in principle, applicable to other plants, but it needs development and a fundamental understanding of the effects of different iron ores to the blast furnace, i.e. one effect associated with low slag practice can be the reduced life of blast furnace refractory.\n\n\nApplicability\nThe applicability is strongly limited to the availability of ores with a high iron content.\n\nEconomics\nThe economic benefits are connected with increased productivity, reduced energy consumption and a decrease in the demand of reducing agents.

This limit is set by the carrying capacity of the coke and the thermochemical conditions in the furnace. In order to maintain suitable raceway conditions and at the same time achieve higher input rates of coal of up to 260 kg/t hot metal, oxygen enrichment of the hot blast and oxy-coal injection at the tuyere level (see Section 6.1.3.1) are applied in EU blast furnace plants. \nAt Corus, IJmuiden, the Netherlands, pulverised coal is injected on a commercial scale.

Thus, emissions at the coke oven plant are prevented. For every kg of coal injected, approximately 0.85 - 0.95 kg of coke production is avoided.\n\nThe application of the oxy-coal injection has increased the injection rate by approximately 20 % and correspondingly has decreased the coke rate. The performance of the ESP used for the Blast Furnace (BF) gas cleaning has improved. Together with the improved positive effect on the permeability in the blast furnace and the improved coal distribution, the whole blast furnace performance has improved. \n\nCross-media effects\nMeasurements have indicated that less than 1 % of the injected coal escapes through the blast furnace top.\n\nOperational data\nIn the case of oxy-coal injection, the two blast furnaces have restrictions concerning hot blast temperature and oxygen enrichment of the hot blast. Therefore, oxy-coal injection is applied by a swirl type, coaxial, oxy-coal lance to improve the gasification of the coal. The oxy-coal lances have eliminated earlier experienced problems with lance clogging and thereby have improved the distribution of the coal between the tuyeres of the blast furnaces. \n\nAt high coal injection rates, the furnace tends toward low wall working and an increase in blast furnace resistance. This indicates that careful control of the burden distribution with low coke rates and a delicate balance between wall and central gas flow are necessary.\n\nIn general, a fully prepared burden is necessary to be able to consistently achieve the highest levels of coal injection.\n\nAt constant blast furnace output levels, the introduction of high coal injection rates will result in an increase in the residence time of coke and burden in the blast furnace compared to an 'all coke' operation. As such, the coke and the ferrous burden materials will be subject to a longer time under the influence of halogenated alkali metal species in the blast furnace gas. However, the introduction of coal injection provides an opportunity to increase blast furnace productivity through co-injection of oxygen. Dependent upon the absolute levels of coal and oxygen injection and the gain in furnace productivity, the rate at which the coke transits the stack may be lower than under conditions of all coke operation.\n\nThe presence of ungasified coal char particles modifies the characteristics of the melted ferrous materials, thus affecting the position and the shape of the melting zone in the blast furnace. \n\nApplicability\nThe method is applicable at all blast furnaces equipped with pulverised coal injection and oxygen enrichment.

Together with the improved positive effect on the permeability in the blast furnace and the improved coal distribution, the whole blast furnace performance has improved. \n\nCross-media effects\nMeasurements have indicated that less than 1 % of the injected coal escapes through the blast furnace top.\n\nOperational data\nIn the case of oxy-coal injection, the two blast furnaces have restrictions concerning hot blast temperature and oxygen enrichment of the hot blast. Therefore, oxy-coal injection is applied by a swirl type, coaxial, oxy-coal lance to improve the gasification of the coal. The oxy-coal lances have eliminated earlier experienced problems with lance clogging and thereby have improved the distribution of the coal between the tuyeres of the blast furnaces. \n\nAt high coal injection rates, the furnace tends toward low wall working and an increase in blast furnace resistance. This indicates that careful control of the burden distribution with low coke rates and a delicate balance between wall and central gas flow are necessary.\n\nIn general, a fully prepared burden is necessary to be able to consistently achieve the highest levels of coal injection.\n\nAt constant blast furnace output levels, the introduction of high coal injection rates will result in an increase in the residence time of coke and burden in the blast furnace compared to an 'all coke' operation. As such, the coke and the ferrous burden materials will be subject to a longer time under the influence of halogenated alkali metal species in the blast furnace gas. However, the introduction of coal injection provides an opportunity to increase blast furnace productivity through co-injection of oxygen. Dependent upon the absolute levels of coal and oxygen injection and the gain in furnace productivity, the rate at which the coke transits the stack may be lower than under conditions of all coke operation.\n\nThe presence of ungasified coal char particles modifies the characteristics of the melted ferrous materials, thus affecting the position and the shape of the melting zone in the blast furnace. \n\nApplicability\nThe method is applicable at all blast furnaces equipped with pulverised coal injection and oxygen enrichment. Direct injection of reducing agents is applicable both at new and existing blast furnaces.\n\nEconomics\nThere are economic incentives for using high rates of coal injection to achieve greater cost savings, particularly at plants which might otherwise face capital expenditure on rebuilding coke ovens or may have to purchase coke. Furthermore, coal injection can allow the use of coals of a lower quality compared to coking coals. This may also reduce costs.\n\nCosts at EUR 10/GJ in 1988 are reported .

Depending on the carbon content of the pulverised coal, between 210 and 260 kg of coal per tonne of hot metal were injected in 2006 (the data differs from Table   6 .100 since the considered reference data there are for 2004). \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nDirect injection of reducing agents decreases the need for coke production. Thus, emissions at the coke oven plant are prevented. For every kg of coal injected, approximately 0.85 - 0.95 kg of coke production is avoided.\n\nThe application of the oxy-coal injection has increased the injection rate by approximately 20 % and correspondingly has decreased the coke rate. The performance of the ESP used for the Blast Furnace (BF) gas cleaning has improved. Together with the improved positive effect on the permeability in the blast furnace and the improved coal distribution, the whole blast furnace performance has improved. \n\nCross-media effects\nMeasurements have indicated that less than 1 % of the injected coal escapes through the blast furnace top.\n\nOperational data\nIn the case of oxy-coal injection, the two blast furnaces have restrictions concerning hot blast temperature and oxygen enrichment of the hot blast. Therefore, oxy-coal injection is applied by a swirl type, coaxial, oxy-coal lance to improve the gasification of the coal. The oxy-coal lances have eliminated earlier experienced problems with lance clogging and thereby have improved the distribution of the coal between the tuyeres of the blast furnaces. \n\nAt high coal injection rates, the furnace tends toward low wall working and an increase in blast furnace resistance. This indicates that careful control of the burden distribution with low coke rates and a delicate balance between wall and central gas flow are necessary.\n\nIn general, a fully prepared burden is necessary to be able to consistently achieve the highest levels of coal injection.\n\nAt constant blast furnace output levels, the introduction of high coal injection rates will result in an increase in the residence time of coke and burden in the blast furnace compared to an 'all coke' operation. As such, the coke and the ferrous burden materials will be subject to a longer time under the influence of halogenated alkali metal species in the blast furnace gas. However, the introduction of coal injection provides an opportunity to increase blast furnace productivity through co-injection of oxygen. Dependent upon the absolute levels of coal and oxygen injection and the gain in furnace productivity, the rate at which the coke transits the stack may be lower than under conditions of all coke operation.\n\nThe presence of ungasified coal char particles modifies the characteristics of the melted ferrous materials, thus affecting the position and the shape of the melting zone in the blast furnace. \n\nApplicability\nThe method is applicable at all blast furnaces equipped with pulverised coal injection and oxygen enrichment. Direct injection of reducing agents is applicable both at new and existing blast furnaces.\n\nEconomics\nThere are economic incentives for using high rates of coal injection to achieve greater cost savings, particularly at plants which might otherwise face capital expenditure on rebuilding coke ovens or may have to purchase coke. Furthermore, coal injection can allow the use of coals of a lower quality compared to coking coals. This may also reduce costs.\n\nCosts at EUR 10/GJ in 1988 are reported .

The capital cost of installing coal injection at Corus, UK, Port Talbot No 4 Blast Furnace in 1997 was approximately EUR 24 million (including some redundant parts from another site).

These contain two or three chambers filled with ceramic or SiO2 elements having a high heat storage capacity. It is carried out preferably in the case of raw gas values of more than 100  150 mg Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)/m3, depending on the raw gas characteristics (e.g. temperature, composition).\n\nFlue-gases containing Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) are passed through the first chamber and absorb the heat stored in it. As they leave the first chamber and enter the incineration compartment, they are already approaching incineration temperature. In the incineration compartment, they are further heated up to 750 to 800 oC using burners, such that the organic substances are practically fully burned. The CO present in the flue-gases is also further oxidised into CO2. Moreover, providing the temperature is at least 800 oC and the residence period at least 1.5 seconds, 90 % destruction of any dioxins present/formed is achieved.\n\nThe hot purified gases leaving the incineration compartment are subsequently passed through the second chamber, where they give up the greater part of their heat again. The gas which has been cooled down leaves the second chamber and is discharged through the chimney. After a certain period of time, when the first chamber has cooled down sufficiently and the second chamber is sufficiently hot, the direction of the gas flow is reversed. The second chamber then heats up the untreated gases and the first chamber cools the purified gases down.\n\nIf a third chamber is present in a thermoreactor, it is used to avoid emission peaks when the gas flow direction is reversed. After the gas flow direction has been reversed, small volumes of scavenging air are passed through this chamber to ensure that no untreated gases can reach the stack.\n\nThe following figure shows a schematic view of a thermal afterburning system in a thermoreactor (three-chamber system) [4, UBA, 2001], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.53: Schematic view of a thermal afterburning system in a thermoreactor (three-chamber system)\n\n\nThe following figure presents flue-gas conduction in an external thermal afterburning system [4, UBA, 2001].\n\n\nFigure 4.54: Flue-gas conduction in an external thermal afterburning system\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nadditional fuel needed, at least for the start-up of the operation and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) concentration below auto ignition point\nadditional NOX emissions possible.\n\n\nOperational data and applicability\n\nIf the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and CO concentrations are high enough, incineration is virtually autothermic. In such cases, no additional energy needs to be added in order to maintain the incineration process. This occurs mainly in the manufacture of highly porous bricks, where large quantities of organic pore-forming substances are added to the raw material mixture.\n\nThermo reactors have been used increasingly in recent years in the clay processing industry, especially in clay block manufacture, where organic pore-forming substances are added to the raw material mixture, and also to reduce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions from the manufacturing processes of other ceramic products, for instance refractory products, technical ceramics and some inorganic bonded abrasives. These systems have the advantage, compared with internal incineration systems, of not interfering with the normal operation of the kiln and that the flue-gas stream is purified in its entirety. There is the problem of high water content in the gases in the manufacture of expanded clay aggregates.\n\nDepending on the required cleaning efficiency, thermoreactors are installed as two- or three- chamber plants. With 2-chamber plants, purification efficiencies of between 94 and 97 % are achievable, whereas 3-chamber plants achieve purification efficiencies of more than 99 % without problems [4, UBA, 2001].\n\nIn this context, see also Table   3 .38 regarding emissions from brick manufacturing processes and Table   3 .86 regarding emissions from manufacturing processes of technical ceramics (bonded abrasives). In these manufacturing processes, thermal afterburners are applied for flue-gas cleaning.\n\nEconomics\n\nIn this context, see Table   4 .95.\n\nto economise on fuel, thermal afterburning of VOCs and CO is carried out preferably with regenerative heat exchange\nthe lower the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and CO concentrations in the raw gas, the more energy that needs to be added to keep the thermoreactor in operation and, therefore the higher the cost.\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nLegal requirements combined with energy efficient process techniques.\n\nExample plants and reference literature\n\nWienerberger Ziegelindustrie AG/Werk Hennersdorf, brick plant, Austria [1, BMLFUW, 2003], [2, VITO, 2003], [3, CERAME-UNIE, 2003], [4, UBA, 2001], [14, UBA, 2004], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005], [32, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2006]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3838847_abstract", "x": 0.5317738, "y": 0.27684423, "title": "COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND METHOD OF REMOVING FLUORINE IN WASTE LIQUID", "year": 2021, "text": "A method of removing fluorine in waste liquid is provided, which includes providing a calcium source and a plurality of ceramic particles (13) to a waste liquid containing fluorine for forming a plurality of calcium fluoride layers (11) wrapping each of the ceramic particles (13).

This mainly occurs due to high firing temperatures inside the kiln, causing the CaSO4, CaCl2 and CaF2 to decompose. At a temperature of about 850 oC the CaF2 starts to decompose.

For instance, in the storage of raw materials, any filter dust can be fed back directly to the production process or to the silo, when a local air cleaning by a silo top-filter is used. But the direct feedback may not be possible when central dedusting units are operated, because of the mixing of different raw materials.\n\nAlso, process losses, which are generated before firing, can normally be re-used as raw materials by adding them to the raw material mixture. Cuttings, used plaster moulds and also dust are the main process losses arising from the shaping process. The cut pieces from the press are often pushed from the pressing table, collected under the press and directly fed back to the material storage of the press. Furthermore, dust or cut pieces are often fed back as batch components in a casting slip or in stoneware masses. Used plaster moulds can be re-used in the cement industry or, after crushing and milling, partly in the fertiliser industry.\n\nDust originating from a flue-gas cleaning system can only be re-used under certain circumstances, because this dust can contain high concentrations of sulphur and fluorine. When added to the raw material mixture, this dust can result in increased emissions of HF and SOX during the firing process. Also dust from a flue-gas cleaning system can contain adsorbent particles like lime - for instance, if an adsorption system containing lime is applied - which influences the product properties. Therefore, a separate conduction of different off-gas streams facilitates the optimal utilisation of dusty process losses. In most cases for the manufacture of expanded clay aggregates, the dust can be recycled.\n\nGypsum generated during flue-gas cleaning, especially in the manufacture of expanded clay aggregates or in the brick and roof tiles industry, cannot be re-used in the process, but is used in the cement industry as a hardening regulator. Materials, which cannot be recycled internally, leave the plant to be used in other industries or to be supplied to external waste recycling or waste disposal facilities.\n\n\n\nFired products which are unsuitable for sale (broken ware) and broken firing auxiliaries as well as broken refractory material from kilns, can in some cases after being ground, be re-used as raw materials. Broken ware which cannot be re-used in the process, can sometimes be used as a raw material input in other industries, for example broken inorganic bonded abrasive wheels are used as refractory material in steel manufacturing furnaces or as a filler in road construction. Broken bricks can be used, for example, as substrates for green roofs, tennis courts or as aggregates for special concretes.\n\nCompared to waste disposal in landfills, the re-use of solid process losses entails:\n\na reduction of raw materials used\na reduction of pollutants released into the environment\nsolid process losses re-used leads to avoid - and therefore save - the disposal costs and also some raw material costs.\n\n[2, VITO, 2003], [3, CERAME-UNIE, 2003], [4, UBA, 2001], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005], [26, UBA, 2005], [28, Schorcht, 2005]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "4008761_abstract", "x": 0.64820373, "y": 0.23062277, "title": "ZERO EMISSION FUEL", "year": 2022, "text": "A zero emission liquefied fuel having a composition including a first portion and a second portion, where the first portion is one of (a) a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or (b) a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) sourced from fossil decomposition and the second portion is a Renewable Natural Gas (RNG).

If a dry body preparation process is involved, although the sludge addition is no problem, management is more complicated as the sludge needs to be dried first.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure shows the schematic view of a sludge recycling installation from a wall and floor tile plant (wet process) [4, UBA, 2001]. The sludge is pumped from the sludge storage to a 2-stage screening unit. Afterwards it passes through a deferrisation filter and then it is fed to a pre-pump storage which has a capacity of 3 m3. From there the sludge is pumped to two 200 m3 buffer basins, which are alternately filled. After a verification of the sludge characteristics and a positive result from the analysis, the sludge is fed to the main storage basin which has a capacity of 400 m3. The ceramic sludge is semi-automatically transported from the main storage basin to proportioning containers from where the drum mills for the different batches are fed.\n\n\nFigure 4.56: Schematic view of a sludge recycling installation\n\n\nBy applying a sludge recycling system, not only is there a reduction of raw material and water consumption, but also a reduction of pollutant releases into the environment can be achieved.\n\nCross-media effects\n\nIf sludge has to be dried for re-use, energy consumption will rise. Attention should also be paid to possible negative consequences from the fact that pollutants coming from a given phase/section of the process/plant, such as glaze preparation and application, are introduced in a different phase/section, such as ceramic body preparation. The controls of gaseous emissions and process waste water represent a suitable solution to prevent such negative consequences.\n\nOperational data and applicability\n\nThe quantity of sludge produced in a wall and floor tile facility ranges from 0.09 - 0.15 kg/m2 finished product on a dry basis, which, for a product with a body mass of 15 - 20 kg/m2, involves 0.4 - 1.0 % (kg dry sludge/kg ceramic body). If all the sludge arising from the treatment of the waste water produced in the process is re-used in the ceramic body preparation process, the addition relative to the body's raw materials is, therefore, around 0.4 - 1.0 % on a dry basis. It has been found, that 1  1.5 per cent sludge addition to the ceramic bodies prepared for the manufacture of tiles, does not generally affect the behaviour of the products during the manufacturing process [10, Navarro, 1998], [32, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2006].\n\n\nConsequently, both in terms of the mass balance and the resulting change in behaviour, the complete incorporation of sludge in wet milling processes is technically feasible and facilitates process management.\n\nIn the case of wet processes in which the ceramic body preparation plant is an independent facility, or if it stands separately from the production facility, the sludge can be returned by road. The aqueous suspensions and sludge can be returned by tankers or conveyed by pipeline.\n\nUsing sludge that contains glaze waste as a glaze constituent would, in principle, seem to be a very suitable option. But the main drawback in this process is the considerable heterogeneity across time of the sludge compositions, owing to the diversity of glazes usually found in production at the same time in most companies. And also this sludge cannot be the sole glaze constituent, but is considered an additive (e.g. used as a fluxing agent). Although it may be a very good solution in some cases, especially if only one or a few different glazes are applied in a facility, the use of this kind of sludge in glaze preparation cannot be considered a general solution.\n\nSludge re-use is, therefore, not applicable in all cases. If there are special requirements on quality or performance, sludge is only re-usable in other products (see Section 4.5.1.2).\n\nEconomics\n\nSludge recycling/re-use leads to avoid - and therefore save - the disposal costs.\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nSaving costs by saving raw material and water consumption and avoiding waste.\n\nExample plants and reference literature\n\n[3, CERAME-UNIE, 2003], [4, UBA, 2001], [6, Timellini, 2004], [10, Navarro, 1998], [13, SYKE, 2004], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005], [32, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2006]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3804595_abstract", "x": 0.71448386, "y": 0.41743508, "title": "VACUUM CLEANING DEVICE WITH AT LEAST TWO MOTORS", "year": 2021, "text": "SummaryThe invention refers to a vacuum cleaning device (2) comprising:\n- a dust collecting chamber (6) with at least one inlet port (10) for dust-laden air (9) and at least one outlet port (12),\n- at least one filter element (14) located between the at least one outlet port (12) and the rest of the dust collecting chamber (6),\n- at least two motors (18, 20) each driving an air blower (22, 24) for drawing air from the dust collecting chamber (6) through an air outlet (26, 28) of the vacuum cleaning device (2), thereby creating a depression in the dust collecting chamber (6), and\n- a control unit (32) for controlling the operation of the at least two motors (18, 20).In order to provide for a high availability of the vacuum cleaning device (2) it is suggested that the control unit (32) is adapted to automatically operate only one of the motors (18, 20) upon activation of the vacuum cleaning device (2).\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.2.2\" title=\"Measures for bulk storage areas\">\n<referenced_by>5.1.3.1</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nMeasures for bulk storage areas \n\nDescription\n\nIn order to reduce primarily diffuse emissions at bulk storage locations of dusty mineral raw materials into the open air, such storage locations can be enclosed with screening, walling or an enclosure consisting of vertical greenery (artificial or natural wind barriers for open pile wind protection). \n\nIf dust emissions at discharge points of storage sites cannot be avoided, they can be reduced by matching the discharge height to the varying height of the heap, if possible automatically, or by reduction of the unloading velocity.

This filter system makes a direct feeding back of glazing particles possible, separated from the off-gas of the spraying cabin. An upstream quiescent zone guarantees that the dust in the system is relatively dry. In an ideal case, the separated glaze particles arise as trickling powder in the filter system.\n\nEconomics\n\nUsually the investment and operational costs of sintered lamellar filters are considerably higher than the costs for bag filters, however the possibility of feeding back the cleaned off-gas into the workplace area allows saving energy costs which would occur, if high volume flows of fresh air would have to be heated up to provide suitable workplace temperatures.\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nlegal requirements\nhealth and safety requirements for the workplace\nraw material savings\nenergy savings.\n\nExample plants and reference literature\n\nOesterreichische Sanitaer-, Keramik- und Porzellan-Industrie AG, sanitaryware plant, Austria [1, BMLFUW, 2003], [4, UBA, 2001], [32, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2006] \n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3023160_abstract", "x": 0.70056635, "y": 0.4101259, "title": "A centrifugal separator", "year": 2016, "text": "A centrifugal separator and a method (1) for separation of particles from a gas stream is disclosed.

Acid components (sulphur oxides and inorganic chlorine and fluorine compounds) are adsorbed in a reactor or a reactor zone, which can be the flue-gas duct between the kiln and the filter with a certain minimum length, to ensure the necessary contact time. The filter behind the reactor (zone) removes the produced neutralisation salts and the excess adsorbent from the flue-gas stream. A bag filter is mainly used for this purpose because it generates good contact between the adsorbent and the gaseous contaminants. The fabric of the filter bags must be resistant to acid and alkaline conditions, and is also defined by the temperature of the gases to be treated (see Table   4 .90). The following figure shows a schematic view of dry flue-gas cleaning with a bag filter [10, Navarro, 1998], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005].\n\n\nFigure 4.50: Schematic view of dry flue-gas cleaning with a bag filter\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrostatic precipitators may be used in place of bag filters, using the same powdered reagent injection system. They offer the advantage of operating at higher gas temperatures (well over 400 oC) so no cooling of the flue-gases is necessary, and energy recovery from the cleaned gases is facilitated. On the other hand, the contact between adsorbent and pollutant is not as good as if a bag filter is used. The following figure shows a schematic view of dry flue-gas cleaning with an electrostatic precipitator [10, Navarro, 1998], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005].\n\n\nFigure 4.51: Schematic view of dry flue-gas cleaning with an electrostatic precipitator\n\n\nA special variant of dry flue-gas cleaning is semi-dry flue-gas cleaning with a filter, also known as conditioned dry flue-gas cleaning. It differs from the dry method because of the use of a small quantity of water. The adsorbent is 'conditioned' by wetting it slightly with water, which increases the reactivity and so the cleaning efficiency is higher. Also, the consumption of adsorbents is lower and the amount of residues is smaller. The disadvantages of this technique are the likelihood of corrosion problems due to higher humidity of the flue-gases and more complex operating controls [2, VITO, 2003].\n\nCross-media effects\n\nthe consumption of adsorbents causes large amounts of waste\nthe recycling of waste can be problematic, due to the negative effects of calcium on the rheology of ceramic slips\nrelatively high electrical energy consumption due to the pressure drop across a bag filter, respectively increased electrical energy consumption due to the operation of an ESP\nnoise may increase if pneumatic filter cleaning systems are applied\ncarbonate containing adsorbents react with the acidic components of the flue-gas to develop CO2.\n\nOperational data and applicability \n\nThe dry flue-gas cleaning system with a filter has flexibility with regard to controls and to the use of adsorbents. Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), calcium oxide (CaO) or, more recently, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), which is most suitable for the removal of SO2, are among the adsorbents which can be used. Additionally, it has to be mentioned that the reaction products of sodium bicarbonate consist of water-soluble salts (sodium sulphate and sodium fluoride) and as a result cannot easily be disposed of by landfill. \nFor cleaning systems with a bag filter, problems can occur at very high temperatures, where the filter could start burning, and at very low temperatures close to the dew point, the filter is easily clogged. The cleaning system with an electrostatic precipitator has the advantage of being able to run at high temperatures, easily exceeding 400 oC, so that no cooling of the flue-gases is required prior to cleaning, and energy recovery from the clean gases is facilitated.\nA dry flue-gas cleaning system with a bag filter allows the achievement of fluoride concentrations in the treated flue-gas of less than 5 mg/m3 and suspended dust concentrations in the range of 2 - 20 mg/m3. The cleaning efficiency of these systems varies from 90 up to 99 % for the retention of suspended particulates, 92 up to 95 % for fluoride retention, 10 up to 80 % for SO2, up to 90 % for SO3 as well as up to 85 % for HCl, if calcium hydroxide is used as the adsorbent [2, VITO, 2003, 10, Navarro, 1998], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005], [30, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005].\n\nAdditionally to an approximate cleaning efficiency of 99 % for suspended particulates, more than 95 % for fluoride retention, 98 to 99 % for SO2 and SO3 as well as 89 % for HCl, can be achieved, if sodium bicarbonate is used as the adsorbent in a dry flue-gas cleaning system with a bag filter (see Section 4.3.6) [4, UBA, 2001]. \n\nThe cleaning system with an electrostatic precipitator has the advantage of being able to run at temperatures of up to approx. 450 oC, so that no cooling of the flue-gases is required prior to cleaning and energy recovery from the clean gases is facilitated. Achievable dust clean gas concentrations in the range of 5 - 50 mg/m3 are reported from flue-gas cleaning with electrostatic precipitators (see Section 4.2.3.5).\n\nDry flue-gas cleaning systems with a filter can, in principle, be applied to clean kiln flue-gases in all ceramic sectors, but the disadvantages - compared to the packed bed adsorber systems - regarding the greater need for maintenance and problems with the durability of the filter bags (in the case of a system with a bag filter) have to be taken into account.\n\nEconomics\n\nIn this context - for dry sorption with bag filter - see Table   4 .95.\n\nFor semi-dry systems, the investment cost is usually slightly higher than for a wholly dry unit\nsodium bicarbonate is more expensive than calcium-based adsorbents\nadditional disposal costs for saturated adsorbents which cannot be re-used, have to be taken into account.\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nLegal requirements.\n\nExample plants and reference literature\n[2, VITO, 2003], [3, CERAME-UNIE, 2003], [10, Navarro, 1998], [4, UBA, 2001], [17, Burkart, 2004], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005], [26, UBA, 2005], [32, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2006]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3909930_abstract", "x": 0.5252101, "y": 0.3303556, "title": "PROCESSING AND TRACKING OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS IN CEMENT KILNS", "year": 2021, "text": "Methods of processing biological materials such as the remains of humans or pets, which may be enclosed in a casket, include depositing the biological materials, including the remains and/or the casket, into a cement kiln and operating the cement kiln to produce clinker, thereby incorporating products of the biological remains into the clinker, such as into a crystal or molecular structure of the clinker, and then grinding the clinker to form a cementitious product.\n", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.3.2\" title=\"Reduction of water vapour levels in the kiln gases\">\n<referenced_by>6.1</referenced_by>\n\n<content>\nReduction of water vapour levels in the kiln gases\n\nDescription, achieved environmental benefits and operational data\n\nReduction of water vapour levels in the kiln gases usually results in lower emission rates for fluoride, because the basic mechanism for the release of fluorine from clay minerals is pyrohydrolysis. This reaction occurs at temperatures of 800 oC and upwards.\n\nCross-media effects, applicability and economics\n\nIn laboratory tests, it was found that reducing the water content in the kiln atmosphere, did result in reduced emissions of HF as well as of SOX. In practice, a reduction of the water content in the kiln atmosphere would be technically difficult to achieve, given that water is produced during the combustion of the fossil fuels used to heat the kiln. This production of water can be avoided only by heating the kiln either indirectly, for instance with gas-fired radiant-tube burners [5, InfoMil, 2003], or by electricity, but this would require a fundamental change in the design of the kiln and entail higher energy consumption.\n\nIn principle, all over Europe only the firing of kilns with fossil fuels is economically viable for the bricks and roof tiles, vitrified clay pipes, refractory products and expanded clay aggregates sectors. Therefore heating the kiln with electricity or indirectly is not really applicable in these sectors (electrical heating is only carried out for short runs of special products in the case of refractory products). In the wall and floor tiles, table- and ornamentalware, sanitaryware, technical ceramics and inorganic bonded abrasives sectors however, the reduction of water vapour levels in kiln gases by heating the kilns with electricity (in the manufacturing of some technical ceramics electrically heated kilns are used to a certain extent) or indirectly with radiant-tube burners [5, InfoMil, 2003] (shuttle kilns or small roller hearth kilns can, in principle, be equipped with these burners for smaller scale production), has a more realistic potential of application.\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nlegal requirements\navoidance of end-of-pipe abatement techniques.\nExample plants and reference literature\n\n[2, VITO, 2003], [3, CERAME-UNIE, 2003], [5, InfoMil, 2003], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3026341_abstract", "x": 0.6757491, "y": 0.2826379, "title": "RECYCLING ROTARY KILN", "year": 2016, "text": "Provided is a regeneration rotary kiln capable of reducing the proportion of combustible gas in waste gas and capable of reducing cost for generating superheated steam.A regeneration rotary kiln (1) is characterized by including: a superheated steam generation unit (2) that generates superheated steam; a tube (3) capable of rotating about its axis and having a heating section (A) where, while the superheated steam is being supplied thereto, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (10) containing a matrix resin and carbon fibers is heated to generate combustible gas (10G) from the matrix resin to extract the carbon fibers (10S) from the carbon fiber reinforced plastic (10); a first combustion chamber (43a) that is placed outside the tube (3) and that burns the gas (10G) introduced from the heating section (A) to heat the heating section (A); and a second combustion chamber (43b) that burns the gas (10G) introduced from the first combustion chamber (43a) to supply heat for generating the superheated steam.", "bref_text": "<bref_section id=\"4.3.3.3\" title=\"Internal carbonisation gas combustion\">\n\n<content>\nInternal carbonisation gas combustion\n\nDescription and achieved environmental benefits\n\nVolatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions which occur in the heating area of the kiln as a result of decomposition and incomplete combustion of organic components in the raw material mixture (known as carbonisation gases), can be subsequently burned in the kiln, provided the kiln has been specially modified. Internal combustion can be achieved by directing the carbonisation gases from the heating zone of the kiln back to the firing zone, where they will be further burned as a result of the high temperature prevailing there. In order to achieve this, the kiln zone where the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions occur (known as the carbonisation zone) needs to be separated from the rest of the kiln. This can be achieved by installing one or more sliding doors in the kiln or with a special extraction system for the carbonisation gases. With this technique, not only Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, but also CO emissions are significantly reduced. The following figure shows a schematic view of internal carbonisation gas combustion [4, UBA, 2001], [30, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005].\n\n\nFigure 4.46: Schematic view of internal carbonisation gas combustion\n\n\nCross-media effects\n\nCarbonisation gas combustion inside the kiln may increase overall energy consumption, especially if additional firing with (high velocity) burners has to be carried out to burn the carbonisation gases from the heating zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nOperational data and applicability\n\nSystems for internal combustion of carbonisation gases have already been in use for some time in Germany, particularly by a few dozen brickworks. These systems enable Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions to be reduced significantly, but suffer from the practical disadvantage that they often interfere with the normal operation of the kiln, and as a result it becomes difficult to control. Doors seizing, for instance, is a known problem in systems which operate with sliding doors in the kiln. The interference of the thermal afterburning inside the kiln, when using a tunnel kiln as a simple counter flow heat exchanger, often leads to problems in the kiln operation mode or to higher operation expenditure. Probably for these reasons, external carbonisation gas afterburning systems have gained increasing favour, especially for new plants in recent years.\n\nThis technique is not applicable for the manufacture of expanded clay aggregates, as there is the problem that drying and firing take place together, which results in gases containing high concentrations of water. \n\nBy employing this technique, clean gas values for total-C of approximately 15 mg total-C/m3 can be obtained, if the raw gas values are 250 mg total-C/m3 [4, UBA, 2001].\n\nEconomics\n\nInternal carbonisation gas combustion is, because of the complicated firing and control techniques, a relatively expensive system regarding maintenance cost. \n\nIn this context, see Table   4 .95.\n\nDriving force for implementation\n\nlegal requirements\navoidance of end-of-pipe abatement techniques.\n\nExample plants and reference literature\n\n[2, VITO, 2003], [3, CERAME-UNIE, 2003], [4, UBA, 2001], [23, Technical Working Group (TWG) Ceramics, 2005]\n\n\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}]
