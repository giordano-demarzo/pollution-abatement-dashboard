In addition, operating costs of the metallurgical process are substantially reduced by regenerating and recycling the reducing agent, iron, and the flux, sodium carbonate.Nowadays, the extraction of metals from mining activity is carried out by conventional and modern processes. On the one hand, we find conventional pyrometallurgical processes, which involve the previous toasting of the mineral before extracting metals in furnaces, and on the other hand, combined pyro, hydro and electrometallurgical processes, in which sulphurated minerals are toasted first, and the dissolved metal to be extracted is then leached and electro-deposited. These processes are highly polluting, though. With respect to modern processes, we find biometallurgy, which uses bacteria for the extraction of metal, with the disadvantage of being slow processes. On the other hand, hydrometallurgy is also used at high pressure, which involves high investment and operating costs.The new metallurgical process consists of:\n- Extraction of metals in the smelting furnace using iron as a reducing agent and sodium carbonate as a flux\n- Selective dissolution in water of sodium sulphide from slag and filtering of waste, ferrous oxide\n- Regeneration of sodium carbonate for recycling\n- Removal of hydrogen sulphide gas and obtaining elemental sulphur\n- Sintering of ferrous oxide agglomerates for subsequent reduction of iron metal\n- Generation of reducing gases, carbon monoxide and hydrogen\n- Regeneration of metal iron for recycling from ferrous oxideThe proposed technological innovation combines novel pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, different from conventional ones, which do not require a prior toasting of the sulphurated mineral concentrate, and are technically and economically more advantageous than the currently used processes because it reduces to zero the positive oxidation state of the metal directly, using a single reactor for the extraction of metal. It regenerates and recycles metallurgical inputs with complementary processes, with a high speed in the kinetics of chemical reactions and, all this, without generating slag or polluting gases. As a result, the extraction of metals is achieved at a low operating cost, in an environmentally sustainable manner, thus avoiding high costs for environmental remediation.It is important to point out that the proposed invention can also be applied to the treatment of tailings and environmental liabilities, solving a problem that has been accumulating for years due to mining activity that is not very environmentally responsible and which, until now, has not been possible to remedy due to the high costs involved.Consequently, by applying this process, the economic viability of mining projects is increased, even under a scenario of lower metal prices. The process involved allows mining companies to obtain lower cut-offs and cash costs for their extractive activity and, in turn, allows them to generate higher revenues from the export of metals, rather than the export of mineral concentrates. In addition, as it is a clean and environmentally friendly technology, it allows mine closure costs to be radically reduced. As a result, this process provides a higher level of profitability and sustainability of mining activity.On the other hand, with a gradual implementation of the proposed process in mining activity, the Government will benefit thanks to the increase in the Trade Balance, resulting from increased exports, and to the higher tax revenue that will be generated by higher business income. This, in turn, positively affects regional and local governments for the higher revenues that will be generated from mining royalties. Increased mining activity will imply greater sources of direct and indirect employment generation, as well as boosting other sectors of the economy, such as the steel, metalworking and construction industries. Added to this are the lower costs of remediation of environmental liabilities. In short, it has the potential to generate higher incomes for the Government, and thus greater socio-economic well-being for the population.The advantages of this technological innovation in the environmental field range from the regeneration and recycling of inputs, and the elimination of slag and polluting gases from the extractive process, to the remediation of tailings from current mining activity as well as existing environmental liabilities, resulting in less pollution of rivers, agricultural fields and less impact on natural reserves. In other words, it significantly reduces the environmental footprint of mining activity.Finally, and as a consequence of the aforementioned, this invention manages to improve health standards in the population adjacent to the mines by reducing emissions and toxic waste, as well as by eliminating risks derived from the potential rupture of dams in tailings. Similarly, mining activity, by ceasing to interfere with the population's agricultural, fishing and livestock activities, reduces the possible emergence of social conflicts, thus allowing the viability of mining projects to increase, which in turn translates into greater social works and an increase in the income of the surrounding population. In conclusion, this innovative process for the extraction of metals has the capacity to generate harmony between mining activity, the environment and the population."}, "3231735_abstract": {"x": 0.6750546, "y": 0.5772196, "title": "EQUIPMENT FOR THE SEPARATION AND TREATMENT OF HOUSEHOLD WASTE", "year": 2017, "abstract": "The invention comprises a surrounding frame wherein four modules are fixed: a first module for glass waste, a second module for plastic and metal waste, a third module for paper/cardboard waste, and a fourth module for organic waste.

These towers are installed in parallel configuration inside the filtration sector. On the lateral sides of the filtration sector, two horizontal, bidirectional channels for feeding and discharge are installed, as depicted on Figure 4 and 5.Each modular case is filled with filter media, composed by a selected mixture of highly adsorbing materials, to maximize the performance.Each modular case is equipped, on its front and back sides, with a calibrated-pore system, in order to calibrate the entering and exiting flowrates of water and guarantee an adequate contact time between water and filtration media, thus enhancing adsorption performance and reducing headlosses (figure 2 and 5).SWID system can be managed and controlled remotely by means of a SCADA software,connected to a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) computing system, in order to monitor and control the whole treatment process at each phase, and manage emergencies and maintenance operations.A tank is located on the front side of the SWID plant for the storage of untreated water during maintenance, emergencies or exceptional contaminant spillovers.

Tilgner and S. Tyszkiewicz together with their students and co-authors. In 1962, Prof. D.J.Tilgner's doctoral student Kazimierz Miler defended his doctoral thesis at the Gdansk University of Technology on the subject of \"Possibilities of producing smoke free of 3,4 benzopyrene and 1,2,3,4 disubenzanthracene\", and Dr. S. Tyszkiewicz published the results of his research on the osmotic nature of the transport of chemicals dissolved or colloidally dispersed in the water of post-mortem muscle juice in the book \"Study of the physical properties of meat\" published in WNT in Warsaw in 1969. Docent Dr. K. Miler, working at the Institutes of the Meat Industry (IPM) and the Meat and Fat Industry (IPMiT), together with numerous co-authors, patented 6 methods of producing smoke preparations (SP) and partially implemented them in Poland and other countries, and after his death in 1994, his student Dr. and later associate professor and professor Adam Borys patented two more SP in 2001 and 2013, but without any chance of their personal implementation. In the 1980s, due to real or fictionalised information about the intention to evict from the cities meat factories emitting smoke from wood-fired smokehouses into the atmosphere and churning wood sawdust, research on smoking with closed smoke circulation in smoke chambers without chimneys was launched at IPMiT. A team of researchers led by Prof. S. Tyszkiewicz patented the method and equipment for smoking with closed smoke circulation and successfully put it into practice. However, larger urban meat factories equipped with mass-produced smokehouses installed smoke afterburners in their chimneys and converted smoke emissions into carbon dioxide emissions, and IPMiT stopped paying to protect the patents it held for closed-smoke smoking. Smaller area plants did not have to change anything, as smoke emissions were not banned and no standardisation of the presence of harmful smoke components was introduced. The situation changed dramatically after the introduction of a standard for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the European Union, and standards also had to be implemented by EU candidate countries. A standard for carcinogenic PAHs in food was introduced in the European Union in 2006, limiting benzo(a)pyrene and the sum of four (PAHs)4 : benzo(a)pyrene BAP, benzo(a)anthracene BAA, benzo(b)fluoranthene BBF and chrysene CH. In 2011, the requirements were tightened with effect from 2014. The contamination limits are set in \u00b5g/kg, which means extremely trace concentrations that are unrealistic under the usual environmental conditions of the earth's atmosphere. This means that the limits set should be regarded as conventional, and dimensionless similarity numbers (BLPs), for example the ratio of the concentration of a single PAH to the sum of four PAHs determined in the same sample by the same method, should be taken seriously. The PAHs in the trace concentrations of the colloid dispersive substance, determined in \u00b5g/kg, when examined by chromatography over a longer period of time after smoking, do not represent the actual degree of contamination, because when the samples are ground and weighed, substances from not only the surface, but also from substances contained in the inner layers, evaporate from them. The smoking method according to the invention removes the two most toxic smoke components from the smokehouse and converts them into carbon dioxide saturating into condensed and separately disposed water. Characterised by a much higher volatility, dibenzo(ah)anthracene (DAHA) is particularly highly toxic, having formerly been considered five times more harmful than BAP. Present in products immediately after the smoking process and evaporating into the atmosphere, it should be determined especially in products that are eaten quickly after smoking or grilling on charcoal grills without a post-smoking process (favourable open hearth with access to air, flambrying). The method of air smoking according to the invention ensures the removal of contamination from the smoke and prevents the contamination from escaping outside the smoking chamber and the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n"}, "3888785_abstract": {"x": 0.60464597, "y": 0.23830782, "title": "SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR GAS TREATMENT", "year": 2021, "abstract": "A system and process for the recovery of at least one halogenated hydrocarbon from a gas stream.

Finally, appropriately regulated irrigation is applied, thus resulting in extraction of the metal by simple aqueous washing.
