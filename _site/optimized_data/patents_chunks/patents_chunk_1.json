It is similar to wet gas scrubbing but uses an amine absorption liquid instead of caustic.  The second stage of the sulphur recovery process is normally located within refineries.

A small stream is purged in order to limit the concentration of high-boiling compounds in the amine solution. The technique is described in full in the REF BREF.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nThe quantity of caustic required for hydrogen sulphide (and carbon dioxide) removal is reduced.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units. Another option is to use more than one treatment unit to treat waste gas streams from different parts of the TDI/MDI process separately. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons), HCl, chlorine and NOX to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThermal oxidisers\nExcept for one outlier, industry reported oxidisers to achieve average Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) concentrations of 0.1-3.4 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2). Concentrations of TCM are generally claimed to be below the limit of detection.\n\nRTOs\nRegenerative thermal oxidisers are only used at one site. They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each. Flows are in the range of 1 800-2 400 Nm3/h and the oxygen content is in the range of 16-18 vol-%.\n\n\nTable 10.13:\tEmissions from MDI production after combined treatment (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO) and caustic scrubber)\n\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)\nThe nitrogen oxide emissions of a DNT plant can be reduced by 99.5 % and the VOC emissions reduced by 99.8 % (2003 LVOC BREF, [ 190, COM 2003 ]).\n\nIndustry reported that one oxidiser with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) achieves an average concentration of 92 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with a maximum concentration (daily average from continuous measurement) of 150 mg/Nm3.\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)\nIndustry reported that two oxidisers with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) achieve average concentrations of 202 mg/Nm3 and 218 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with maximum concentrations (for 30-minute samples) of 280-320 mg/Nm3.\n\nWet scrubbing\nHCl: From the air emission survey (Section 10.3.1.5.2), reported maximum HCl emissions were typically (all but two plants) below 10 mg/Nm3 both for combined treatment and for scrubbers without a thermal oxidiser. Average emissions were in the range of < 0.11-3 mg/Nm3, with three oxidisers reporting higher emissions. See also Table 10.13. HCl emissions will depend on the content of HCl and chlorinated hydrocarbons in the raw gas and are mainly expected from the phosgenation units. \nChlorine: Chlorine is not expected to be in the raw waste gas from the MDI/TDI process but may be present if the combined treatment also treats waste gas from the upstream or integrated chlorine production. Chlorine may also be formed in small quantities from the oxidation of HCl. In the air emission survey (see Section 10.3.1.5.2), all average emissions of chlorine reported were < 1 mg/Nm3 which is near the limit of quantification (typically about 0.5 mg/Nm3).

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR).

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units. Another option is to use more than one treatment unit to treat waste gas streams from different parts of the TDI/MDI process separately. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons), HCl, chlorine and NOX to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThermal oxidisers\nExcept for one outlier, industry reported oxidisers to achieve average Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) concentrations of 0.1-3.4 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2). Concentrations of TCM are generally claimed to be below the limit of detection.\n\nRTOs\nRegenerative thermal oxidisers are only used at one site. They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each. Flows are in the range of 1 800-2 400 Nm3/h and the oxygen content is in the range of 16-18 vol-%.\n\n\nTable 10.13:\tEmissions from MDI production after combined treatment (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO) and caustic scrubber)\n\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)\nThe nitrogen oxide emissions of a DNT plant can be reduced by 99.5 % and the VOC emissions reduced by 99.8 % (2003 LVOC BREF, [ 190, COM 2003 ]).\n\nIndustry reported that one oxidiser with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) achieves an average concentration of 92 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with a maximum concentration (daily average from continuous measurement) of 150 mg/Nm3.\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)\nIndustry reported that two oxidisers with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) achieve average concentrations of 202 mg/Nm3 and 218 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with maximum concentrations (for 30-minute samples) of 280-320 mg/Nm3.\n\nWet scrubbing\nHCl: From the air emission survey (Section 10.3.1.5.2), reported maximum HCl emissions were typically (all but two plants) below 10 mg/Nm3 both for combined treatment and for scrubbers without a thermal oxidiser. Average emissions were in the range of < 0.11-3 mg/Nm3, with three oxidisers reporting higher emissions. See also Table 10.13. HCl emissions will depend on the content of HCl and chlorinated hydrocarbons in the raw gas and are mainly expected from the phosgenation units. \nChlorine: Chlorine is not expected to be in the raw waste gas from the MDI/TDI process but may be present if the combined treatment also treats waste gas from the upstream or integrated chlorine production. Chlorine may also be formed in small quantities from the oxidation of HCl.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units. Another option is to use more than one treatment unit to treat waste gas streams from different parts of the TDI/MDI process separately. \n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduction of emissions of organic compounds (including chlorinated hydrocarbons), HCl, chlorine and NOX to air.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nThermal oxidisers\nExcept for one outlier, industry reported oxidisers to achieve average Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC) concentrations of 0.1-3.4 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2). Concentrations of TCM are generally claimed to be below the limit of detection.\n\nRTOs\nRegenerative thermal oxidisers are only used at one site. They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each. Flows are in the range of 1 800-2 400 Nm3/h and the oxygen content is in the range of 16-18 vol-%.\n\n\nTable 10.13:\tEmissions from MDI production after combined treatment (Regenerative Thermal Oxidiser (RTO) and caustic scrubber)\n\n\nSelective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)\nThe nitrogen oxide emissions of a DNT plant can be reduced by 99.5 % and the VOC emissions reduced by 99.8 % (2003 LVOC BREF, [ 190, COM 2003 ]).\n\nIndustry reported that one oxidiser with Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) achieves an average concentration of 92 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with a maximum concentration (daily average from continuous measurement) of 150 mg/Nm3.\n\nSelective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)\nIndustry reported that two oxidisers with Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) achieve average concentrations of 202 mg/Nm3 and 218 mg/Nm3 (11 % O2), with maximum concentrations (for 30-minute samples) of 280-320 mg/Nm3.\n\nWet scrubbing\nHCl: From the air emission survey (Section 10.3.1.5.2), reported maximum HCl emissions were typically (all but two plants) below 10 mg/Nm3 both for combined treatment and for scrubbers without a thermal oxidiser. Average emissions were in the range of < 0.11-3 mg/Nm3, with three oxidisers reporting higher emissions. See also Table 10.13. HCl emissions will depend on the content of HCl and chlorinated hydrocarbons in the raw gas and are mainly expected from the phosgenation units. \nChlorine: Chlorine is not expected to be in the raw waste gas from the MDI/TDI process but may be present if the combined treatment also treats waste gas from the upstream or integrated chlorine production.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each.

Average emissions were in the range of < 0.11-3 mg/Nm3, with three oxidisers reporting higher emissions. See also Table 10.13.

If needed, the treatment may include further treatment steps, e.g. the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to abate NOX emissions or injection of activated carbon to remove PCDD/F. \n\nTechnical description\nFollowing the application of specific process-integrated prevention, recovery and pretreatment steps (see Sections 6.4.1.1 to 6.4.1.3), the waste gas streams are combined and routed to an appropriate combined treatment to remove VOCs. This typically consists of a thermal oxidiser to destroy VOCs, a post-scrubber system to remove HCl and, if needed, a post-treatment (Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR)) to reduce NOX emissions. Instead of the thermal oxidiser, an incinerator for the combined treatment of liquid waste and the waste gas may be used.\n\nFor thermal oxidisers, see Section 2.4.3.5.6. The temperature and residence time have to be sufficient to destroy the organic pollutants. High temperatures are needed to destroy some of the pollutants, especially tetrachloromethane from the phosgenation unit.\n\nScrubbing to reduce HCl is needed when the raw gas contains HCl or HCl precursors (chlorinated organic compounds) which mainly occurs in  waste gas from the phosgenation step and downstream processing. Depending on the HCl content, a caustic scrubber is used or a two-stage system where HCl is recovered in the first stage (absorption in water or diluted acid), followed by a caustic scrubber to minimise emissions of HCl and chlorine (which can be present in the raw gas or formed from HCl). Due to the significant amount of CO2 in the gas, the composition of the circulating liquid and the amount of caustic added is chosen to capture HCl, but prevent CO2 absorption. See also Section 0.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of thermal NOX from the combustion, regenerative thermal oxidisers (RTOs) with electrical heating have proven to be efficient if the potential for NOX formation from NOX precursors (chemical NOX) is low. However, if the raw gas contains relevant concentrations of NOX or NOX precursors (nitrogen-containing organic compounds, ammonia), a dedicated post-treatment is needed. Generic options are the use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) or, if it is equally efficient or if Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) cannot be used, Selective Non-catalytic Reduction (SNCR). See also Section 2.4.\n\nTo prevent or reduce emissions of PCDD/F, where relevant, rapid quenching and activated carbon injection can be applied (see Section 2.4.3.5.6).\n\nCombined waste gas treatment may be shared for the whole TDI or MDI process or shared to also treat waste gas from other units.

Concentrations of TCM are generally claimed to be below the limit of detection.\n\nRTOs\nRegenerative thermal oxidisers are only used at one site. They are reported to treat waste gases from MDI phosgenation and work-up sections at temperatures between 800 degC and 1 000 degC to achieve removal efficiencies of 95-98 % for MCB and 95-97 % for TCM. The reported outlet concentrations of the caustic post-scrubber (from a quartals measurement in the first year after installation) of TCM are in the range of 2-9 mg/Nm3, corresponding to a specific TCM load of 0.5 g/t of MDI produced (which would correspond, from the ratio of molecular weights, to 0.7 g/t of TDI produced for TDI plants). \n\nRTOs use electric heating. They have been reported to achieve very low NOX emissions (< 2-4 mg/Nm3).\n\nFurther data from RTOs are listed in Table 10.13. The measurements refer to averages from three samples over half an hour each.

Average emissions were in the range of < 0.11-3 mg/Nm3, with three oxidisers reporting higher emissions. See also Table 10.13.

When fully hydrotreated aromatics cuts are used as feedstock to the extraction section, clay treaters are typically not used, but, in cases where they may be available, they show very long operating cycles.\n\nAchieved environmental benefits\nReduced generation of waste.\n\nEnvironmental performance and operational data\nSpent clay consumption depends largely on the bromine index of the feed. A typical reformate has a bromine index of 100, leading to a clay consumption of 1 tonne per 10 000 Mt of feedstock.\n\nCross-media effects\nConsumption of energy for compression.\n\nTechnical considerations relevant to applicability\nThis technique is only applicable to plants using raw materials with a high olefin content. For feeds with reduced amounts of olefins, such as those coming from reformers, hydrogenation is not justified with respect to costs and cross-media effects (higher energy consumption).\n\nEconomics\nInvestment and operational costs for hydrogenation may exceed the costs for clay treatment, especially when the olefin content is low.\n\nDriving force for implementation\nNo information provided.\n\nExample plants\nNo information provided.\n\nReference literature\nNo reference literature provided.\n</content>\n</bref_section>"}, {"APPLN_ID": "3693085_abstract", "x": 0.66554296, "y": 0.18579416, "title": "COMPOSITION CAPABLE OF REDUCING CO AND NOX EMISSIONS, PREPARATION METHOD THEREFOR AND USE THEREOF, AND FLUID CATALYTIC CRACKING METHOD", "year": 2020, "text": "The present invention relates to the field of catalytic cracking, and discloses a composition capable of reducing CO and NOx emissions, the preparation method and use thereof, and a fluidized catalytic cracking method.

The replacement of natural gas by hydrogen leads to a higher flame temperature and therefore higher potential for the formation of NOX which can be prevented/compensated by primary measures. The sulphur content of the fuel is typically low. In the European Union (EU), no plants use liquid fuels.\n\nb)\tFurnace design\nEDC crackers are cabin-type furnaces. EDC passes through one or several coils located inside the 'cabin'. The heat is delivered by burners fixed to the lateral walls of the cabin in horizontal furnaces or at several different height levels in vertical ones. In order to achieve good distribution of the heat to the coil, without local overheating of tubes, it is important to distribute burners along the vertical surface of the cabin and to use flat flame or terrace wall burners (as already included in the 2003 LVOC Best Available Techniques (BAT) conclusions). Local overheating of tubes can lead to metallurgical degradation of the tube material and to increased formation of by-products and coke inside the coil.\n\nTo reduce NOX emissions from process furnaces, there is a selection of measures available (for more details see the description in the generic section, Section 2.4.4.4):\n\nlow-NOX burners;     \nstaged combustion burners;\ninternal recirculation;\nexternal recirculation.\n\nHowever, not all of them are applicable for EDC crackers (see technical considerations relevant to applicability below).\n\nThe lower operating temperatures of EDC cracking furnaces in comparison with lower olefin crackers or large combustion plants mean that there may be more potential to reduce combustion temperatures to minimise the production of thermal NOX. However, the potential may be very limited, when the resulting flame temperatures are still similar to olefin crackers (especially when hydrogen is burnt).\nc)\tCombustion control\nSee the Large Combustion Plants (LCP) BREF (gas-fired furnaces).
